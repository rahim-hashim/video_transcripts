*  yo yo yo yo [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=31.76s)]
*  That's why, thank you for letting me write deep cover, NG thing, ghost writing for you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=61.76s)]
*  It was definitely a little bit of shade, but I felt like they handled it well. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=65.52s)]
*  Both of them handled it well. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=71.8s)]
*  Dr. Dre looked good. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=72.8s)]
*  I ain't seen him in a while. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=73.8s)]
*  He actually looked good. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=75.08s)]
*  And all that was in the prompter, so they knew that they was going to say that. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=76.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=80.0s)]
*  You think Snoop was reading a lot of Snoop, but like freestyled a lot of his. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=81.0s)]
*  Yeah, Snoop went off the prompter at first, and then he went back to the prompter. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=86.32s)]
*  It was a good show. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=90.32s)]
*  I know she's out there, so we'll ask Lauren if she has any details. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=91.36s)]
*  I know she was backstage. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=93.36s)]
*  But it was a great show. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=94.36s)]
*  Salute to BET. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=95.36s)]
*  Drop a bomb for BET. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=96.36s)]
*  I love to watch all the performances. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=97.36s)]
*  I like seeing everybody show up for the BET Awards. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=99.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was wanting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=102.36s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=103.36s)]
*  There was only like one time where they was like, this person wasn't here, and that was [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=104.36s)]
*  Sizzle, but then Sizzle ended up showing up later. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was probably like, it was late. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=109.63999999999999s)]
*  It was probably running late. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  Everything was running behind, but I thought it was really, really dope. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=111.63999999999999s)]
*  And Letticee, Letticee did so good. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=114.63999999999999s)]
*  Her pipes, man. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  Oh, she was singing, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=118.63999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like singing live. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=119.96s)]
*  I never heard her sing live. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=120.96s)]
*  I'm like, damn, she had low-key the best performance of the night when it comes to like singing [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=121.96s)]
*  live. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=127.4s)]
*  Like what? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=128.4s)]
*  I ain't gonna lie, she did, but Jennifer Hudson killed it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=129.4s)]
*  Jennifer Hudson killed it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=130.4s)]
*  She killed it on the Jamie Foxx tribute. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=131.4s)]
*  It wasn't the full performance. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=132.4s)]
*  Yeah, she did. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=133.4s)]
*  It was great. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=134.4s)]
*  There was a lot of icons that they like meshed in together being honored in one night. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=135.4s)]
*  I felt like Ryan Carey, Snoop Dogg, Jamie Foxx, Kirk Franklin. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=141.12s)]
*  Man, they four big people that you're trying to cram in one show. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=146.6s)]
*  Their tribute should have been a little longer, but I mean everybody showed up. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=151.28s)]
*  It was great. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  It was a lot of tributes. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  They had a lot of Icon Awards, right? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm not mad at that, though. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm not mad at the tributes. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Four in one night, I feel like Jamie Foxx could have been a little bit more drawn out. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  Like this man's like... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=164.08s)]
*  When you see all the people that was dead that they kept going to, that got their flowers [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  after they passed, I was happy to see the tributes because everybody that got their [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  tribute last night and their Icon Award deserved it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=173.24s)]
*  I get what Jess is saying. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=176.24s)]
*  If you do just a little bit less, then you can do longer performances. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=177.24s)]
*  That's all. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=180.24s)]
*  You can still do the awards, just maybe shorten it to three. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=181.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=184.24s)]
*  Because I think they did what, four? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=185.24s)]
*  It was four. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=186.24s)]
*  Four big icons. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=187.24s)]
*  So if you do four, cut the filler of the rest of the stuff. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=188.24s)]
*  I was disappointed I didn't see my full 106 and Parks. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=193.24s)]
*  Listen, I felt like we got gypped, man. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=196.24s)]
*  We didn't see AJ was a day. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=199.24s)]
*  I would have loved to see AJ and Free out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=200.24s)]
*  I'd have loved to see TJ and Terrance and Roxy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=202.24s)]
*  And I saw them, but we saw little glimpses of them and I felt like it should have been [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=204.8s)]
*  more around 106 and Parks. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=209.8s)]
*  They could have had a cypher with battle raps. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=210.8s)]
*  They could have shown some new music videos. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=213.8s)]
*  The whole show should have been 106 and Parks. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=216.8s)]
*  The whole show should have been formatted like 106 and Parks. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=219.8s)]
*  The different eras of 106 and Parks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=222.8s)]
*  Yeah, then AJ said he was on a flight, he couldn't make it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=223.8s)]
*  AJ, you was on press tour. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=226.8s)]
*  Y'all was on a press tour. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=227.8s)]
*  You know where you have to be. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=228.8s)]
*  I know where Roxy was at. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=229.8s)]
*  I talked to Roxy yesterday. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=230.8s)]
*  I talked to her. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=231.8s)]
*  I'll tell y'all later on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=233.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=236.36s)]
*  It was all together. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=237.36s)]
*  Overall, it was great. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=238.36s)]
*  I loved Tyler Perry's speech. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=239.36s)]
*  Yeah, Tyler Perry's speech was dope. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=240.36s)]
*  Snoop's speech was dope, too. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=241.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, hell yeah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=242.36s)]
*  Snoop's speech was really, really, really dope. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=243.36s)]
*  Mariah Carey looked good as hell. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=244.36s)]
*  She did. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=245.36s)]
*  Why does she always walk like that? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=246.36s)]
*  Like her feet hurt. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=247.36s)]
*  She was a diva. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=248.36s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=249.36s)]
*  But I think she was the most down to earth that we've ever seen her last night. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=250.36s)]
*  I honestly really do. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=253.36s)]
*  I feel like she was great. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=254.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=255.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=256.36s)]

*  Now, Amanda Serrano will be joining us this morning. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=263.92s)]
*  She is a boxer. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=267.12s)]
*  She's a boxer champion in, I think, across seven divisions. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=268.44s)]
*  Seven different weight classes. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=270.64s)]
*  Yeah, seven different weight classes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=271.64s)]
*  So we're going to talk to her. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=272.64s)]
*  Only female boxer that ever achieved that feat. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=273.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=275.2s)]
*  So we're going to talk to her. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=276.2s)]

*  She's Puerto Rican. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=279.2s)]
*  She's from Brooklyn. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=280.2s)]
*  And we'll chop it up with her in a little bit. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=281.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=282.6s)]

*  Okay, y'all. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  So first on front page, tensions continue to rise in Los Angeles, California, following [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  a fourth day of anti-ice demonstrations yesterday. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  Another 2,000 California National Guard troops have been tasked with keeping peace in Los [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=313.8s)]
*  Angeles. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=318.84s)]
*  California Governor Gavin Newsom says only 300 of the first 2,000 have actually been [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=319.84s)]
*  deployed. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=324.08s)]
*  He said the rest are sitting unused in federal buildings without orders. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=325.08s)]
*  Also about 700 Marines have since been activated to respond to civil unrest as well in L.A. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=328.76s)]
*  The Marines are also stationed in 29 Palms with a mission to protect federal buildings [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  and agents who are being met with continued protests amid immigration raids. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=339.2s)]
*  Now, California Governor Gavin Newsom says President Trump should not be deploying Marines [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  on American soil, calling it un-American. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=347.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump believes residents of L.A. should be thanking him for sending [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=349.8s)]
*  the National Guard, as his administration put it, to keep the public safe. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=355.12s)]
*  Let's take a listen to President Trump's comments. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=359.04s)]
*  I think his primary crime is running for governor because he's done such a bad job. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=361.76000000000005s)]
*  It's lucky for the people in Los Angeles and in California that we did what we did. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=367.56s)]
*  We got it just in time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=372.88000000000005s)]
*  So yesterday a reporter asked Trump if Borders R. Thompson should arrest California Governor [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=375.32s)]
*  Gavin Newsom over the anti-ice demonstrations in L.A. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=382.11999999999995s)]
*  Now Trump said he would if he were Tom and he thinks that would be great. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=385.32s)]
*  Now Newsom responded to that, those comments saying that Trump's comments are a sign of [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=388.91999999999996s)]
*  authoritarianism and he announced a lawsuit against the White House for federalizing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=393.84s)]
*  the California National Guard, which I'll get into later. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  Trump is also dismissing the lawsuit saying he had no choice noting cars were burning [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=401.44s)]
*  and people were rioting. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=405.68s)]
*  Now meanwhile, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, she says federal authorities will prosecute [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=407.4s)]
*  protesters who commit crimes. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=413.56s)]
*  Now, Pondi said, the person who allegedly threw rocks at federal law enforcement vehicles [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=415.24s)]
*  during the protest has been identified and authorities have conducted a search warrant [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=419.44s)]
*  on their home. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=423.92s)]
*  She added a message for protesters who are anything less than peaceful. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=425.08s)]
*  Let's take a listen to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=430.16s)]
*  You can run, you can't hide. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  We are coming after you federally. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  If you assault a police officer, if you rob a store, if you loot, if you spit on a police [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=438.88000000000005s)]
*  officer, we're coming after you. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  Why they didn't have that same energy for the January 6th insurrectionist that assaulted [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=446.92s)]
*  law enforcement officers. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  And then you know, you said something else Morgan, you said they sent the National Guards [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=452.52000000000004s)]
*  to keep the peace. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=456.36s)]
*  Like do you send National Guards to keep peace? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=457.36s)]
*  I guess I'm just trying to figure out what is the National Guard doing that local law [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=460.44s)]
*  enforcement can't do? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=464.16s)]
*  Like people throwing rocks and you send the National Guard in? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=465.8s)]
*  But I guess they're saying the local, the local departments can't do it because obviously [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  they still doing it. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=471.98s)]
*  They're still protesting. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=472.98s)]
*  They're still throwing rocks and bricks. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=473.98s)]
*  Yeah, did you say they was like up on a bridge and they had cars and they were like, well [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=475.32s)]
*  they could have killed whoever was in them cars. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=478.8s)]
*  Local enforcement couldn't do it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=480.8s)]
*  It seemed like they couldn't do anything. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=481.8s)]
*  I mean, because that's what you said, the National Guard and when local law enforcement [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=482.8s)]
*  is overwhelmed, were they overwhelmed? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=485.88s)]
*  So that is to be determined by local law enforcement and the governor. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=488.52s)]
*  You know, that's something that the governor is supposed to decide in that if federal agents [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=492.91999999999996s)]
*  or the Trump administration decides to bring in the National Guard or deploy the National [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=496.91999999999996s)]
*  Guard, then they would do so in tandem with local law enforcement. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=503.52s)]
*  And that seems to not be the case right now. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=508.14s)]
*  Local law enforcement is kind of like standing idly by not so much. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=510.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they're not necessarily helping. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=513.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=514.68s)]
*  They don't have any orders in regards to this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=515.68s)]
*  This is just a federal takeover. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=517.2s)]
*  Yeah, because it's federal overreach because the governor is supposed to say, hey, we need [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  the National Guard. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=523.0400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=524.0400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=525.0400000000001s)]
*  I think what he was trying to do is make sure it doesn't get out of hand. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=526.0400000000001s)]
*  Make sure they stop it before it goes any further because the fact that there was no [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=529.48s)]
*  respect for law enforcement out there. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the way that they're like they're throwing bricks at cars driving by and the [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=535.5200000000001s)]
*  way they're burning things down, there's no respect. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=538.84s)]
*  And I think he's trying to jump in front of it before it happened because you could tell [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=540.6800000000001s)]
*  they have no respect. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  There's no peaceful protest in a lot of those places. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=545.7199999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of places where they are peaceful protesting, but there's a lot where there's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=547.64s)]
*  no respect for law. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=550.88s)]
*  I think the National Guard escalates it to a different level. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=551.88s)]
*  That's it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  I was going to say to your point, yeah, that's what a lot of local authorities, including [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=555.9599999999999s)]
*  Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is pretty much saying, Charlemagne, is that it doesn't help [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=559.8399999999999s)]
*  to bring in the National Guard. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  It actually escalates the situation. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=566.2399999999999s)]
*  But we'll continue to talk about it in the seven o'clock hour because there's so much [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=567.88s)]
*  to cover regarding the situation. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=570.68s)]
*  So stick around. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=572.1999999999999s)]
*  And on both sides, I think they're going too far. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=573.24s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen that one video where the officer shot the actual reporter. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=576.76s)]
*  The repability. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=582.36s)]
*  Yeah, she was actually reporting live. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=583.36s)]
*  I guess she's an Australian reporter or from overseas and she's reporting. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=585.84s)]
*  She's sitting there and you see the police officer or whoever it was at the time point [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=589.2s)]
*  his gun at her and shoot her. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=593.36s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=594.6800000000001s)]
*  Live on camera. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  But it was hilarious last night on The Daily Show when they added that little sound effect [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  and it was like bang. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=600.88s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=601.88s)]
*  I did not see that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=602.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=603.88s)]
*  Hilarious. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=604.88s)]
*  I feel so bad. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=605.88s)]
*  They showed it regular first, but then Jon Stewart was like, no, I know, I know. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=606.88s)]
*  When you had a sound effect to it and they put that little bang on it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=610.24s)]
*  Oh, hilarious. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=613.52s)]

*  Y'all are stupid. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=616.52s)]

*  Hey, man, I just want to tell y'all, I think the governor is doing an awful job over there. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=875.52s)]
*  He should have stepped in sooner. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=880.52s)]
*  He's trying to have a measuring contest with the president. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=882.52s)]
*  And if he don't, the president don't step in. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=885.52s)]
*  He's damned if he do and damned if he don't. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=887.52s)]
*  So he might as well be damned if he do, because if he don't, we're going to be on him anyway. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=889.52s)]
*  On top of that, you got somebody who- [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=892.52s)]
*  But hold on real quick. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=894.52s)]
*  I'm not disputing you, because I don't know. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=896.52s)]
*  I don't think Gavin Newsom does the best job in California either. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=898.52s)]
*  But the protest just began on Friday. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=901.52s)]
*  Like literally just Friday. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=903.52s)]
*  Yeah, look at how violent it turned right away. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=905.52s)]
*  Did it? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=907.52s)]
*  Let's get out of here. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=908.52s)]
*  Yeah, you're not seeing that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=909.52s)]
*  Let's get out of here. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=910.52s)]
*  It ain't a peaceful protest everywhere. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=911.52s)]
*  It's peaceful protests a lot of places, but let's get out of here. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=912.52s)]
*  Let me ask y'all a question. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=914.52s)]
*  It's a very peaceful protest, but the rioting, if nobody steps in and does nothing, then [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=915.52s)]
*  we're over here talking about, oh, we're burning ourselves down. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=919.52s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=922.52s)]
*  They should have intervened earlier. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=923.52s)]
*  And then what? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=925.52s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=926.52s)]
*  We're burning all our communities down. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=927.52s)]
*  So what's the point of spending so much money in law enforcement and already having the [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=929.52s)]
*  law enforcement militarized? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=934.52s)]
*  Law enforcement got weapons and armor and all of that kind of stuff. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=936.52s)]
*  If you spend hundreds of millions of dollars on law enforcement, how do they get overwhelmed [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=939.52s)]
*  so fast by protestors? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=945.52s)]
*  To what you're sending in the National Guard? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=947.52s)]
*  And did you even see the National Guard yesterday? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=949.52s)]
*  Most of them were just sleeping because they had nothing to do. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=951.52s)]
*  Did y'all see that? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=953.52s)]
*  Yeah, they had them in strategic points, right? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=955.52s)]
*  I don't know how they run that, but when you see videos of police officers being hurt, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=957.52s)]
*  bleeding and everything else, you got to do something. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=962.52s)]
*  He's supposed to be in office for his people. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=965.52s)]
*  Those police officers, those local police officers are also his people. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=969.52s)]
*  Our communities that we are burning down are our people. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=973.52s)]
*  We all know LA riots can tend to get out of control real fast. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=977.52s)]
*  So that's been... [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=982.52s)]
*  I mean, listen, if the LAPD was overwhelmed, I understand. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=984.52s)]
*  They definitely were overwhelmed. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=987.52s)]
*  I mean, you can see from a lot of stuff that they've seen. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=988.52s)]
*  Cops bleeding everywhere. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=990.52s)]
*  Cops were hit with tear gas. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=992.52s)]
*  I mean, they were overwhelmed. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=994.52s)]
*  They were. They needed some help. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=995.52s)]
*  That wasn't planned out correctly. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=997.52s)]
*  I don't know if sending in the National Guard was the correct thing to do, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=999.52s)]
*  but they were definitely overwhelmed. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1001.52s)]
*  They needed some help. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1003.52s)]
*  Something had to be done. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1004.52s)]
*  They were overwhelmed, and our community is the one being hurt. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1005.52s)]
*  Something had to be done. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1008.52s)]
*  Thank you, brother. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1009.52s)]
*  So, I mean, you know what? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1010.52s)]
*  Hey, I have a question for you. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1012.52s)]
*  What's up, bro? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1014.52s)]
*  What did you do for Dominican Mother's Day, bro? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1015.52s)]
*  Just that, bro. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1017.52s)]
*  You didn't do nothing? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1019.52s)]
*  I was on the Puerto Rican Day Parade float, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1020.52s)]
*  but I'm not Dominican nor am I Puerto Rican, so I don't know. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1022.52s)]
*  But salute to all the Dominican moms out there. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1024.52s)]
*  You're definitely Puerto Rican, bro. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1026.52s)]
*  I'm kind of mad you don't play much, bro. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1028.52s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1029.52s)]
*  D-L-O. Did I say D-L-O? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1030.52s)]
*  I love y'all, man. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1032.52s)]
*  Peace, team. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1033.52s)]
*  Keep your foot on their neck, Jeff. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1034.52s)]
*  Already know, bro. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1035.52s)]
*  And I also want to say, if the LAPD got overwhelmed that fast, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1036.52s)]
*  then they need to get their budget cut, then, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1040.52s)]
*  because they got allocated over $2 billion for the 2025-26 fiscal year. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1042.52s)]
*  And that's for salary adjustments, technology upgrades, security services. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1046.52s)]
*  That's a lot of money that the militarized police forced to get overwhelmed that fast by protest. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1051.52s)]
*  Get it off your chest. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1056.52s)]
*  800-585-1051. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1058.52s)]

*  Let's get to the latest with Lauren. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1076.52s)]
*  Lauren becoming a straight face. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1078.52s)]
*  Tell us, man. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1080.52s)]
*  She gets into somebody that knows somebody. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1081.52s)]
*  She gets the details. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1083.52s)]

*  Sometimes you have facts, sometimes you have details, sometimes you have a little bit of everything. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1092.52s)]
*  But it's the latest. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1096.52s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1097.52s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1098.52s)]
*  All right, y'all. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1100.52s)]
*  So yesterday, the BET Awards went down, and Kevin Hart hosted. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1101.52s)]
*  He opened up with his monologue, making a few jokes, throwing some shots at people. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1106.52s)]
*  He took a shot at Diddy, and he threw a joke at Cardi B. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1110.52s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1113.52s)]
*  So much history has been made on this stage tonight, which is why we are celebrating 25 [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1114.52s)]
*  years of BET, of excellence, tonight. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1119.52s)]
*  It's also the 45th anniversary, man. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1123.52s)]
*  And I honestly, it's an amazing thing for me simply because I get to see the culture [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1126.52s)]
*  and the lens that I think we need to see each other in more often, man. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1131.52s)]
*  Also, also, I'm going to do my part. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1134.52s)]
*  I'm shutting down the idea of after parties. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1136.52s)]

*  Take y'all home. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1157.52s)]
*  You can't bribe them. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1158.52s)]
*  Nobody in the car. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1160.52s)]

*  I didn't even think about it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1233.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1234.52s)]
*  Nelly with the down down beat. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1235.52s)]
*  He was huge on 106th and Park. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1236.52s)]
*  I'd love to see Nelly perform. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1237.52s)]
*  What a great era, man. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1238.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1239.52s)]
*  It was lit. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1240.52s)]
*  Remember, 106th and Park was so big that if you was just a judge on Freestyle Fridays, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1241.52s)]
*  that was a big look for you. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1244.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1245.52s)]
*  Freestyle Friday, Judge Dad a couple times. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1246.52s)]
*  DJ there a couple of times. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1247.52s)]
*  It was just a great time. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1248.52s)]
*  What a time. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1249.52s)]
*  And all those were huge artists during the 106th and Park era. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1250.52s)]
*  Videos were big, right? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1255.52s)]
*  Yes, on the countdown. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1256.52s)]
*  Now I talked to Ashanti backstage and I asked her about that, about just the nostalgia of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1257.52s)]
*  it. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1261.52s)]
*  Because that's what it felt like last night. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1262.52s)]
*  Everybody showed up. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1263.52s)]
*  It felt like elegance last night. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1264.52s)]
*  People were excited to be there. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1266.52s)]
*  There were so many big names in the building. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1267.52s)]
*  But she said one of the things she's been remembering a lot of is just when you walk [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1269.52s)]
*  the doors of 106th and Park and you feel the crowd go crazy because you feel so much love. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1273.52s)]
*  And that's what last night felt like to her, she said. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1277.52s)]
*  Now in closing of the 106th and Park tribute, all the hosts came out and they did their [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1280.52s)]
*  thank yous. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1285.52s)]
*  I want to note that Roxy and AJ were missing, notably from... [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1286.52s)]
*  Those are two big misses, by the way. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1290.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1292.52s)]
*  Because let's be clear, if we're being honest, there's two sets of hosts that when you think [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1293.52s)]
*  106th and Park, you think about. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1297.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1298.52s)]
*  And that's AJ and Free and Terrence and Roxy. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1299.52s)]
*  That's it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1301.52s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1302.52s)]
*  That's the ones we remember. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1303.52s)]
*  And they were on the press tour. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1304.52s)]
*  They came up here together. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1305.52s)]
*  So we're excited to see them. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1306.52s)]
*  They were also... [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1307.52s)]
*  I mean, I didn't see AJ running around this weekend, but I saw Roxy. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1308.52s)]
*  I went to the 106th and Park Day party in celebration for this and I saw Roxy. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1310.52s)]
*  So people were asking where... even backstage, you were like, wait, where is AJ? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1314.52s)]
*  Where is Roxy? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1318.52s)]
*  Well, I spoke to Roxy yesterday. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1319.52s)]
*  Roxy, she's in France working. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1320.52s)]
*  She wanted to be there. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1322.52s)]
*  She tried to be there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1323.52s)]
*  But sometimes you got those gigs, those opportunities you can't change and they clash with other [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1324.52s)]
*  things. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1328.52s)]
*  And you got to make a choice. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1329.52s)]
*  I mean, you'll see what the gig is real soon because it is a really big gig. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1330.52s)]
*  And I understand that because last night was a great moment, but that's the past. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1334.52s)]
*  You still got to think about your now and your future. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1338.52s)]
*  I get it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1340.52s)]
*  And she was running around all weekend. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1341.52s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1342.52s)]
*  She was out and about. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1343.52s)]
*  And the BG Awards came early this year. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1344.52s)]
*  It's always usually at the end of the month. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1346.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1348.52s)]
*  That is true as well, too. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1349.52s)]
*  It's never like June... what was it? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1350.52s)]
*  June 9th? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1351.52s)]
*  Or was it yesterday? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1352.52s)]
*  The 9th? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1353.52s)]
*  It's usually like June 20th. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1354.52s)]
*  June 9th, yes. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1355.52s)]
*  I would say the only person that was missing during the 106 and Park performances was Mario [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1356.52s)]
*  to me. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1361.4s)]
*  Mario from Baltimore. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1362.4s)]
*  That was very much his era, you know what I mean as well. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1363.4s)]
*  And he performed the beats he experienced like before the show, but I think he should [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1367.2s)]
*  have been on that stage singing. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1370.48s)]
*  You say he's just a friend like, yo, like that Mario was missing. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1372.8s)]
*  One thing Baltimore going to do is represent for Baltimore for balls of candy. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1376.56s)]
*  You already know. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1379.56s)]
*  Period. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1380.56s)]
*  You can't be hearing the show now before the show. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1381.56s)]
*  Baltimore Twitter must have been having that conversation. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1383.56s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1385.6s)]
*  Where is Mario? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1386.6s)]
*  Did they see where AJ was? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1387.6s)]
*  I seen him post something that said he was on a flight, but that's all I heard. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1388.6s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1392.6s)]
*  They should have planned that out, man. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1393.6s)]
*  They all should have been on that stage to me. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1394.6s)]
*  Well, and in rap, one thing I will say when Free popped up on that screen backstage, cast [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1396.6s)]
*  and crew went crazy because I think we were all just excited to see her on stage again. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1402.56s)]
*  And they gave a wrap up thank you to a ton of people. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1406.84s)]
*  And we talked about this yesterday. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1409.56s)]
*  They honored Mr. Stephen Hill. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1410.56s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1411.56s)]
*  I do want to thank each and every one of you that tuned in and welcomed us into your homes [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1413.56s)]
*  on a daily basis, tuning into 106 and Park. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1418.56s)]
*  Thank you so much, BET. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1421.56s)]
*  And who else do we have to thank, Free? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1423.56s)]
*  I think that we wouldn't all be here right now celebrating 106 and Park. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1425.56s)]
*  We got to give a round of applause to Stephen Hill. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1429.56s)]
*  I don't know where you are. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1431.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1432.56s)]
*  Would there be no 106 and Park without you? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1433.56s)]
*  Stephen! [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1435.56s)]
*  Stephen! [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1436.56s)]
*  Stephen! [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1437.56s)]
*  Stephen! [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1438.56s)]
*  Stephen! [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1439.56s)]
*  Stephen! [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1440.56s)]
*  Stephen, we love you. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1442.56s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1443.56s)]
*  And I know Stephen, we wanted to make sure we thank our entire production crew, everybody [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1444.56s)]
*  that made this show work. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1449.56s)]
*  Listen, we could not have done it without the BET family. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1451.56s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1453.56s)]
*  All you and the staff and the executives that held us down and made sure that their artists [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1454.56s)]
*  came through. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1458.56s)]
*  We just really want to thank you and everybody out in the street that hugs us, yells at us, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1459.56s)]
*  does all kind of love and for y'all. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1463.56s)]
*  Like, thank y'all. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1465.56s)]
*  They could have formatted the whole show like 106 and Park last night. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1466.56s)]
*  Yeah, I thought that that's what they were going to do. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1469.56s)]
*  But instead of making it just like a part of the show, I thought those hosts were going [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1471.56s)]
*  to actually host the full show. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1474.56s)]
*  They could have formatted the whole show. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1476.56s)]
*  Like 106 and Park. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1477.56s)]
*  The performances could have took the place of the videos. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1478.56s)]
*  Like, you know, you have a little small conversation with the guests, like especially during the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1480.56s)]
*  Icon Award part. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1484.56s)]
*  Could have been like some ciphers going on, you know, Bow Wow could have hosted a little [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1485.56s)]
*  bit of it because that was Mr. 106 and Park, you know what I mean? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1489.56s)]
*  I think I'd much rather hear, I'd much rather hear like small conversations than these artist [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1493.56s)]
*  speeches. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1498.56s)]
*  Yeah, boy, they be dragging them speeches. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1499.56s)]
*  It was a lot of speeches last night. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1500.56s)]
*  Everybody showed up last night. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1502.56s)]
*  Everybody did. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1504.56s)]
*  Some of those speeches were warranted though. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1505.56s)]
*  Like, I'd love to hear Snoop's speech last night. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1506.56s)]
*  Jamie Foxx needed it. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1508.56s)]
*  I would have liked to hear Jamie Foxx in conversation. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1510.56s)]
*  Yeah, that would be great. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1513.56s)]
*  Yes, I would have liked to hear somebody actually asking Jamie Foxx questions. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1515.56s)]
*  I think it was so overwhelming for him in that moment because everything that he's been [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1518.56s)]
*  through. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1522.56s)]
*  And it was a lot. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1523.56s)]
*  Well, we're going to bring back in a second hour because there is a lot more to last night [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1524.56s)]
*  to the BET Awards. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1529.56s)]
*  Jamie Foxx will talk about that as well in rapping. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1530.56s)]
*  I did want to mention, Envy, you mentioned this. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1533.56s)]
*  AJ Calloway did post on his Instagram that he was on a flight. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1535.56s)]
*  He tried to make it, but it didn't work. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1538.56s)]
*  And he sends much love to his BET family. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1540.56s)]
*  And he says he'll do something again when they can all make it out and hopefully let [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1542.56s)]
*  everybody know to join up, join them when they do get back together again. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1545.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1549.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1550.56s)]
*  And salute to DC Young Fly, man. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1551.56s)]
*  What? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1552.56s)]
*  He was killing it, man. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1553.56s)]
*  He killed it. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1554.56s)]
*  He ate them six times. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1555.56s)]
*  I only saw DC once. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1556.56s)]
*  He was there only like three times. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1557.56s)]
*  Four times. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1558.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1559.56s)]
*  Three different outfits on, three different tuxes on. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1560.56s)]
*  He killed it last night. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1563.56s)]
*  He must have had DC on the late shift then because I saw him once. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1564.56s)]
*  He was all throughout the show. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1567.56s)]
*  He was in the beginning, he was in the middle, and he was in the end. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1568.56s)]
*  In the pre-show. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1571.56s)]
*  Yeah, he killed it. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1572.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1573.56s)]
*  When we come back, we got front page news and inboxer Amanda Serrano will be joining [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1574.56s)]
*  us. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1578.56s)]
*  So don't go anywhere. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1579.56s)]
*  It's The Breakfast Club. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1580.56s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1581.56s)]
*  We are DJ NV Jess Hilarious, Charlamagne the guy. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1582.56s)]
*  We are The Breakfast Club. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1585.56s)]
*  Let's get back to some front page news and some quick sports. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1586.56s)]
*  Tomorrow is game three, OKC versus the Pacers at 8.30 p.m. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1589.56s)]
*  They're scratching this out, man. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1594.56s)]
*  They need to get it over with, man. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1595.56s)]
*  We don't need two days in between. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1596.56s)]
*  They usually give you two days between when you go from the east to the west. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1597.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1600.56s)]
*  Let's get this over with. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1601.56s)]
*  Geez. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1602.56s)]
*  Relax a little bit. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1603.56s)]
*  Ain't nobody watching these games no way. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1604.56s)]
*  Yo, shut up. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1605.56s)]
*  What's up, man? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1606.56s)]
*  It's true. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1607.56s)]
*  It was the low end. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1608.56s)]
*  All right, y'all. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1609.56s)]
*  Well, the conversation continues from the first hour about the anti-ice protests that [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1610.56s)]
*  are underway in Los Angeles, California. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1615.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, the top cop in L.A. says the Marines are not communicating with his department [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1617.56s)]
*  while about 700 Marines are headed to the city. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1622.6s)]
*  L.A. police chief Jim McDonald says he's not getting a formal notification. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1624.84s)]
*  He says the lack of coordination is concerning. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  And the chief says it presents a significant logistical and operations challenge for those [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1631.32s)]
*  charged with safeguarding the city. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1635.8999999999999s)]
*  Now, California attorney general Rob Bonta says the state of California is going to sue [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1638.0s)]
*  President Trump and his administration for deploying hundreds of National Guard members [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1643.3999999999999s)]
*  to L.A., calling the move unlawful. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1647.72s)]
*  Now, Bonta said it requires the governor's consent to activate the National Guard. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1649.76s)]
*  And Newsom didn't call for it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1655.8s)]
*  Let's take a listen to California attorney general Rob Bonta. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1657.3999999999999s)]
*  The governor of California knows how to call in the National Guard if and when it's needed. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1660.24s)]
*  He did it with the L.A. fires. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1664.82s)]
*  He did it in the summer of 2020 with some of the protests in California. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1666.1999999999998s)]
*  So this is something that is within Governor Newsom's sovereignty. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1671.12s)]
*  If local law enforcement did decide they needed further support, the first rational step would [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1674.1999999999998s)]
*  be to call upon other nearby agencies. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1678.6399999999999s)]
*  Call in mutual aid. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1682.9199999999998s)]
*  So Bonta goes on to say that this actually diverts resources that are needed for the [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1684.04s)]
*  wildfire season and it escalates tension in the city. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1689.32s)]
*  Now, he goes on to say the law used to activate the troops had only been invoked once before [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1693.0s)]
*  in modern history in the 1970s. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1697.44s)]
*  And this is the first deployment without a governor's consent since 1965. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1700.32s)]
*  Now, the White House justifies the action by citing lawlessness in L.A. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1704.0s)]
*  Governor Newsom claims there's no need for the National Guard and accused Trump of wanting [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1709.48s)]
*  a spectacle. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1713.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass says her city is being used for an experiment as [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1714.68s)]
*  the federal government brings in the National Guard and Marines to counter immigration [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1719.06s)]
*  protests. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1722.94s)]
*  Now, Bass spoke on Monday night saying it makes her feel like this is a test for what [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1723.94s)]
*  happens when the federal government moves in and takes authority away from the state [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1727.3s)]
*  and from local government. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1731.82s)]
*  Now, she pushed back against comments describing the city as being invaded and occupied by [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1733.26s)]
*  illegal aliens and criminals, calling it a despicable description. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1737.74s)]
*  Let's take a listen to L.A. Mayor Karen Bass's comments. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1741.98s)]
*  This kind of atmosphere, it creates a chaos in our city. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1745.58s)]
*  People not sure whether they should go outside, whether they need to stay inside. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1750.74s)]
*  We did not need this. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1754.82s)]
*  The population of all of Los Angeles needs to know that we will stand with them. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1756.1s)]
*  We're not going to allow our city to be divided and picked apart. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1760.74s)]
*  So the LAPD has announced that the city is going on tactical alert, meaning officers [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1764.02s)]
*  can be kept on past their shift in time and transferred between divisions. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1769.54s)]
*  The demonstrations, of course, started on Friday in response to immigration raids that [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1775.3s)]
*  were happening around the city. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1778.62s)]
*  And bringing things home to you guys up there in New York, well, Mayor Eric Adams and the [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1780.5s)]
*  NYPD Commissioner, Jessica Tisch, she addressed New York City on Monday evening or he addressed [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1785.1399999999999s)]
*  they both addressed New York City on Monday evening following these protests that are, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1791.78s)]
*  of course, happening in L.A. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1795.54s)]
*  Now, Mayor Adams says what's happening in L.A. will not happen in New York. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1796.78s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1800.94s)]
*  The escalation of protests in Los Angeles over the last couple of days is unacceptable. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1802.66s)]
*  It would not be tolerated if attempted in our city. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1807.94s)]
*  There was a bunch of anti-ice protests yesterday in New York, a bunch of large crowds. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1810.94s)]
*  That's all it takes is, you know, you starting to see this stuff and then, you know, people [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1816.46s)]
*  are going to start galvanizing and organizing in their own cities. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1820.46s)]
*  But, you know, as you heard from the audio, New York Mayor Eric Adams had a message for [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1823.18s)]
*  New Yorkers. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1828.5400000000002s)]
*  Now, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch goes on to say that while they encourage peaceful [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1829.5400000000002s)]
*  protests, the NYPD will have no tolerance for violence or blocking of public spaces. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1833.5800000000002s)]
*  Their comments, of course, comes just it came hours after two dozen protesters were arrested [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1839.22s)]
*  after occupying Trump Tower in Midtown. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1844.7800000000002s)]
*  So yeah, it does appear that this is this is something that, like I said, it impacts [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1848.0600000000002s)]
*  everybody from us here, from the case with Kilmar Abrego Garcia to L.A., to you guys [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1851.62s)]
*  in New York. I mean, immigrants are all over this country. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1857.78s)]
*  And that's essentially what built this country, especially, you know, the original immigrants, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1860.54s)]
*  the backs of slaves. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1864.78s)]
*  But I won't get too much into that. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1865.78s)]
*  But yeah, this is something that impacts a lot of people. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1866.9399999999998s)]
*  And we I will continue to keep you guys posted as these stories develop. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1869.8999999999999s)]
*  And even in L.A. is interesting, right? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1874.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, I was reading out, you know, Gavin Newsom was saying Trump sent deployed two thousand [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1875.6999999999998s)]
*  troops to L.A. Right. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1880.1s)]
*  He's deploying another two thousand troops to L.A. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1881.62s)]
*  But he was like the first two thousand were given no food, no water, and only three hundred [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1883.6599999999999s)]
*  have been deployed. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1888.98s)]
*  The rest are just sitting in a federal building without orders. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1889.98s)]
*  So what's the point? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1893.74s)]
*  I'm not sure, but I guarantee that these people are racking up a coin on their check. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1895.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's not wasteful or fraudulent or abusive. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1899.3s)]
*  And then they said that they're just there to protect federal buildings. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1902.78s)]
*  That's the only reason they were sent there, just to protect federal buildings. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1906.22s)]
*  And supposedly the public and of course, public safety as well. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1909.58s)]
*  But yes, those are that's that have been their missions to protect public safety and federal [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1913.06s)]
*  buildings and agents who are being met with continued protests amid the immigration raids. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1917.54s)]

*  We are the Breakfast Club. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1984.5s)]
*  We got our brother, Ak, with us this morning. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1985.74s)]
*  Hey, we got a special guest in the building. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1987.42s)]
*  The champ is here. Amanda Serrano. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1990.0600000000002s)]
*  Welcome. How are you feeling? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1992.02s)]
*  I'm feeling great. Feeling great. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1993.26s)]
*  It's a little too early for me, but for you guys, I'll sacrifice. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1994.58s)]
*  You was at the parade yesterday. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1997.86s)]
*  Yes, yes. It was amazing. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=1999.26s)]
*  It was it was I was there in 2019. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2000.86s)]
*  I got honored as one of my Guinness Book of World Records for seven division. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2003.58s)]
*  And it was like a complete different parade this time. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2008.5s)]
*  Everyone knew who I was. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2013.42s)]
*  People screamed my name. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2014.8999999999999s)]
*  It just felt so welcoming and so awesome. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2016.1s)]
*  Yeah, you won, like you just said, titles in seven different weight classes. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2019.62s)]
*  Are you chasing greatness? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2023.3s)]
*  Are you chasing something something deeper? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2024.38s)]
*  I'm chasing legacy, and I believe I've accomplished that already. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2026.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm the first Puerto Rican to become undisputed male or female [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2030.66s)]
*  and first seven division world champion. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2034.46s)]
*  So now it's just going other stuff, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2037.6200000000001s)]
*  making money, making money and opening the doors [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2042.0200000000002s)]
*  and continue to open the doors for women in the sport. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2044.8600000000001s)]
*  He mentioned seven divisions. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2047.3400000000001s)]
*  People don't realize how difficult that is. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2048.6600000000003s)]
*  The only fighter that has done more is Manny Packer. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2050.7400000000002s)]
*  We just talked about him has done eight divisions. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2053.38s)]
*  So that's questionable, Mark. You should know. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2056.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but that was in the in the books. Right. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2058.06s)]
*  So so what she's done is like it's insane. Right. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2060.46s)]
*  But there's another division that you haven't fought in one forty seven. Right. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2064.1400000000003s)]
*  And I just want to throw that out there because I know that Clarissa is a lot bigger. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2067.58s)]
*  She's fighting heavyweight, one fifty four, one sixty. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2071.9s)]
*  But she's a big name in the sport. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2074.38s)]
*  And for some reason, you girls were cool. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2075.7400000000002s)]
*  But it's like tension. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2078.34s)]
*  Like you put out a tweet that I actually respect your tweet, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2079.6600000000003s)]
*  because it's kind of like you were fed up of her attacking MVP, your promoter. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2082.2999999999997s)]
*  It is that a pipe dream if it ever came if she came down one forty seven. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2086.02s)]
*  Could that fight ever happen? [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2090.22s)]
*  Well, tell us what's your natural weight first? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2091.22s)]
*  No, I'm the champion currently. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2092.82s)]
*  I'm the featherweight champion, which is one hundred twenty six pounds. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2094.62s)]
*  Twenty pounds. Jesus. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2097.7799999999997s)]
*  I am fighting for the title at one forty with Katie Taylor. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2099.18s)]
*  But respectfully, I respect Clarissa, what she's done in the sport. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2103.5s)]
*  I respect her as an athlete, her accomplishments. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2108.14s)]
*  But I came here today to talk about July 11th, to talk about me, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2110.7799999999997s)]
*  to talk about the girls that are making history at Madison Square Garden on Netflix. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2114.82s)]
*  So she said something she said to the man. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2119.18s)]
*  He is questionable. Why? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2122.62s)]
*  Because he won two in two divisions. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2124.86s)]
*  They weren't world titles. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2127.3s)]
*  They were regional titles. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2128.42s)]
*  All my divisions was world titles. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2130.3s)]
*  Got you. I need to ask, you know, when when gaining that much weight, right, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2132.34s)]
*  when you're naturally one twenty six and you have to gain twenty pounds, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2135.98s)]
*  how does that affect you, affect your speed, affect your strength and affect your mental? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2139.94s)]
*  It does. It does affect you. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2143.66s)]
*  People don't realize it. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2145.14s)]
*  It's harder for me to go up in weight than to make the lower weight [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2146.38s)]
*  because I walk around one thirty four, one thirty five. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2149.62s)]
*  So it's easy for me to drop ten pounds. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2153.46s)]
*  But when I'm going up, a lot of these girls, they can withhold my power. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2156.14s)]
*  They can, you know, they can, you know, the power is I still have power at that weight. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2159.5s)]
*  But it's just a lot easier for them to to withhold it. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2165.06s)]
*  And it's it's absolutely constantly eating my trainer, my sister. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2168.66s)]
*  Everyone's like, for some you have to eat, you have to eat healthy. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2174.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not like you eat burgers. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2177.06s)]
*  But I'm like, I'm not I'm not hungry. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2178.42s)]
*  I just finished training. I'm not hungry. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2180.5s)]
*  And they're like, no, you have to eat because I can lose weight really, really fast. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2182.22s)]
*  I refuse to believe you ate healthy yesterday after the party. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2186.02s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2188.8199999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2189.3799999999997s)]
*  Everybody, you know, was cooking. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2190.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, honestly, I didn't. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2192.7799999999997s)]
*  But I had a fried fish sandwich. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2193.8599999999997s)]
*  So probably not Puerto Rican food. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2196.94s)]
*  It was just it was crazy. It was crazy. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2199.38s)]
*  Well, you're you're right. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2201.5s)]
*  You're speaking of July 11th. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2203.18s)]
*  You are fighting Casey Taylor. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2204.62s)]
*  You already fought her twice. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2205.8199999999997s)]
*  Now, what are you doing differently this fight? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2207.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. I brought in new people for the camp. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2210.8199999999997s)]
*  I have a nutrition coach now, Cindy Miller. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2213.9s)]
*  She's been helping me on feeding me good food. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2217.14s)]
*  I have a running coach. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2219.46s)]
*  His name is Spencer. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2223.1s)]
*  He's the one who helped people turn to that and all his fights. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2223.98s)]
*  So that's been a great help for me. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2227.3s)]
*  I hire another assistant coach that's helping me keep my distance, helping me [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2230.18s)]
*  like with my head movement and boxing and stuff like that. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2235.98s)]
*  But listen, we me and Katie had 20 great rounds together. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2239.46s)]
*  We bring great fights. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2243.7s)]
*  We show the fans that we can fight. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2245.78s)]
*  And this fight is going to be no different. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2248.22s)]
*  You know, we had headlining Madison Square Garden on an all girl card. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2249.7799999999997s)]
*  And the good thing is that all these girls are coming to fight. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2254.5s)]
*  So we don't we don't know who is going to be the fight of the night. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2257.8599999999997s)]
*  So all of us are stepping our game up. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2261.54s)]
*  I'm stepping my game up. I need this win on paper. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2263.62s)]
*  I believe I won both fights, but this one is different [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2266.62s)]
*  because I need the judges to see that that I won this fight. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2269.2599999999998s)]
*  I need this fight on paper. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2272.9399999999996s)]
*  So, yeah, we're working a little different, smarter. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2274.1s)]
*  And I believe this the third time's a charm. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2276.4599999999996s)]
*  And, you know, the fact that they are fighting a trilogy, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2279.5s)]
*  even though Katie got both decisions, speaks to like how close those fights were [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2282.94s)]
*  and how many people felt you even won both of those fight. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2288.06s)]
*  What fight you think was close out of the first two? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2292.58s)]
*  The first one, the first one was a good fight. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2294.9s)]
*  My coach told me after the fight, he said, I think it's 96, 94 is pretty close. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2297.34s)]
*  So when the first judge said that, he looked at me and he said, you see, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2301.86s)]
*  yeah, I got it. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2305.26s)]
*  But the second one, I think, was pretty clear that I won. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2308.02s)]
*  I landed one hundred and seven more punches on Katie Taylor. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2312.38s)]
*  People say that I get hit a lot. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2317.22s)]
*  Listen, one hundred and seven punches. That's a lot of punches. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2318.74s)]
*  And you did it. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2321.14s)]
*  The sixth round, you heard her? I think it was. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2322.3s)]
*  The first one was the fifth. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2324.1s)]
*  The second one was the first and a couple of rounds. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2325.5s)]
*  Like, I've heard Katie every fight, both fights I've heard. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2327.74s)]
*  She's never really hurt me other than the headbutts. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2330.7s)]
*  But, you know, I respect Katie as a fighter. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2333.38s)]
*  She's a great fighter, a great champion. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2335.78s)]
*  And she's going to come to fight. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2337.58s)]
*  She needs this win to be like convincingly. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2339.2999999999997s)]
*  She she needs the fans to say, OK, Katie won this fight. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2343.02s)]
*  And listen, I'm a professional. I'm a champion. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2347.06s)]
*  If Katie was to beat me, like clearly, I would say pass off to Katie. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2349.7799999999997s)]
*  Katie, you're a great champion, a great fighter. You beat me. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2354.58s)]
*  But I just don't feel it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2357.7s)]
*  The fans don't feel it. My my team doesn't feel it, doesn't see it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2359.18s)]
*  So I'm like, oh, just this one is like this. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2362.8199999999997s)]
*  They're like the last hurrah. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2365.5s)]
*  How do you feel confidence in the judges during that now? Right. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2366.98s)]
*  Because you think you lost. You think you won both of them. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2369.86s)]
*  You feel like you were cheated. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2371.66s)]
*  So how do you still have that confidence in the system and the judges? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2372.86s)]
*  Because you the punch show. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2375.3s)]
*  Yeah, I know that that's the only thing that I'm like, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2376.7s)]
*  we need we need better judges. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2380.3s)]
*  And hopefully the team gets that work before I step into that ring, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2381.7s)]
*  because I feel like those two fights, it was like four against one or five [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2387.26s)]
*  against one, because the judges, Katie and the referee, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2391.98s)]
*  the referee wasn't on my side the last fight as well. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2395.38s)]
*  So I just want a fair fight. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2398.38s)]
*  I just want me and Katie to fight and the winner, you know, takes it all. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2399.62s)]
*  I mean, it's just how do you fix the politics of boxing? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2403.82s)]
*  I mean, you can clearly watch those fights until boxing politics came into play. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2407.46s)]
*  So how do you fix? Yeah. And it's not just my fight. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2410.94s)]
*  You know, you see it every day, every time there's a fight. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2412.94s)]
*  I mean, that I don't know. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2416.54s)]
*  I don't know if the judges are influenced by the crowd [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2418.02s)]
*  or the influence by the promoters. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2421.98s)]
*  Or it's just really hard. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2423.94s)]
*  I don't know what they think and what they're seeing. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2425.46s)]
*  I don't know if they need to watch it in a screen because I watch fights front row. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2427.58s)]
*  And it's really hard. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2432.34s)]
*  It's so hard to see a good fight. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2434.22s)]
*  Sometimes the referee gets in the way. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2436.14s)]
*  I just don't know what they're seeing. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2439.06s)]
*  I've seen fights where the judges have to like be moving around [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2440.7s)]
*  to actually see the action like. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2444.26s)]
*  And then if the person's back is against that one judge, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2446.18s)]
*  you don't know what's happening. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2449.7s)]
*  So I don't know if maybe a screen would be a better. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2451.18s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2453.94s)]
*  We're still kicking it with boxer Amanda Serrano. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2455.1s)]
*  Her fight is July 11th in Madison Square Garden. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2457.46s)]
*  I want to go back to the second fight. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2460.4199999999996s)]
*  What round was it that you got the cut again? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2462.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it was the fourth. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2465.02s)]
*  Fourth. The fourth. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2466.8199999999997s)]
*  So you fought six rounds with blood in your eye. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2468.46s)]
*  How do you avoid those headbutts like going into the third fight? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2473.74s)]
*  Like, is there a strategy where we know what Katie does? [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2478.06s)]
*  Like, is there something you're going to do to kind of avoid getting hit with the head again? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2481.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, maintaining our distance, definitely, because once I heard her, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2484.9s)]
*  I know she's going to come in and try to hold me and try to grab me and then lose her head. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2488.86s)]
*  I mean, she's very good at using her head. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2492.74s)]
*  I mean, not taking anything away from Katie. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2495.62s)]
*  She's a great champion. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2498.1s)]
*  She's very, very skillful fighter. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2499.1s)]
*  But, you know, I think what I've got hurt the most was with the head [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2501.22s)]
*  and the second headbutt was so painful. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2504.98s)]
*  Like, people don't know. The first one, I was like, OK, whatever. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2508.2200000000003s)]
*  But the second one, it was a very open wound and it hit the bone. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2511.58s)]
*  And I was like, I saw black for a second. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2515.7000000000003s)]
*  I was like, what is going on? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2517.9s)]
*  That's I was just so I was pissed off. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2520.18s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2523.06s)]
*  And then there was no help with the referee. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2524.62s)]
*  The referee wasn't really warning her with the headbutt. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2526.38s)]
*  But listen, this happens in the sport of boxing. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2528.98s)]
*  And it's just on to the next one. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2531.5s)]
*  How much does the fight? I'm sorry. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2533.7s)]
*  You did say third time, Mr. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2535.38s)]
*  John, I'm with you. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2536.66s)]
*  But are you prepared for it to go the other way? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2537.62s)]
*  Like, what would it mean for you to win? [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2539.5s)]
*  I mean, to lose third time to Katie? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2541.86s)]
*  It will suck. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2544.3s)]
*  I'm like, my God, three times. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2545.62s)]
*  I mean, but I'm not thinking about that. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2548.3s)]
*  I'm not putting that into the universe. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2549.94s)]
*  I'm not a fest in a win like I always do. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2551.42s)]
*  But, you know, like I said, if she wins [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2554.02s)]
*  the way she's supposed to win, then I'm going to be like, listen, OK, she got it. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2557.7799999999997s)]
*  But I'm just hoping that [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2562.26s)]
*  the judges are watching the fight in different ways. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2564.78s)]
*  Well, you and Katie had the best fight on that card with Jake Paul and Tyson. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2568.5s)]
*  So, right. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2572.06s)]
*  But when I think about that fight, I think about how bloody it was. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2572.9s)]
*  Like, it looked like mortal combat. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2575.82s)]
*  How much does how much does that take out of you? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2578.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, it takes a lot of you, you know, honestly, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2581.1s)]
*  knowing that you have this cut, I'm just blessed that I have a great a great corner. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2584.86s)]
*  My cut man was amazing. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2589.7000000000003s)]
*  I did not know how big the cut was until I saw it in the monitor. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2591.22s)]
*  And the monitor you can use. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2595.66s)]
*  It wasn't that bad when I went to the back to get stitched up. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2597.3399999999997s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God, I put a bird of tear to my eye [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2600.2599999999998s)]
*  because I thought about my family back home watching Netflix. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2603.5s)]
*  I was like, oh, because I know it looks a lot worse on TV. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2606.5s)]
*  So it takes a lot of all that blood. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2610.2999999999997s)]
*  And then it wasn't just that one headbutt. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2612.58s)]
*  It just kept happening and her rubbing her head on it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2615.66s)]
*  You definitely can feel it. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2618.2599999999998s)]
*  I believe if I did lose a round, it was the round after the cut [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2619.74s)]
*  because I was just like probably still in pain. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2624.7799999999997s)]
*  But that didn't stop me. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2626.8999999999996s)]
*  You saw you saw the heart I had in there. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2628.14s)]
*  I was like, let's go. Let's keep fighting. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2631.1s)]
*  And but it can take a lot of it. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2633.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, there's been men with smaller cuts that can continue and quit before her. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2636.14s)]
*  So Jake Paul has signed so many women. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2640.2999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, this is all girls card. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2643.4199999999996s)]
*  He's done a lot for women's boxing. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2645.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you feel like you are kind of the reason [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2646.7799999999997s)]
*  because, you know, what he's done with your career and and how successful you've been? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2650.4599999999996s)]
*  That's why women are saying, I want to go there. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2655.8999999999996s)]
*  Look, look, look what a man has been able to do. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2657.9799999999996s)]
*  Listen, Jake Paul and Nikkisa Badarian, MVP, have changed my life completely. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2660.66s)]
*  They have changed the sport of female boxing, and I am super proud to be part of them. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2665.22s)]
*  And yes, yes, I believe that these women in the beginning, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2669.18s)]
*  these a lot of people had a lot of stuff. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2673.18s)]
*  This negative stuff to say about Jake and Nikkisa. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2675.74s)]
*  And I took that chance to be with Jake Paul, because when I met Jake Paul and Nikkisa, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2678.54s)]
*  they told me where they wanted to go. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2684.7799999999997s)]
*  They asked me how much I was getting paid, what you want to do in the sport and whatever. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2687.02s)]
*  They made sure the first card that I was co-made of, and he said, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2691.54s)]
*  I want the whole card to make the most money that they made. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2697.18s)]
*  So he paid me the most money I got paid. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2700.7799999999997s)]
*  Before that, how much have you, what was your biggest payday before MVP? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2703.62s)]
*  Not definitely, not seven figures, way less than that. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2708.62s)]
*  I got paid $4,000 for world title fights. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2711.54s)]
*  I got paid $4,000 for tying up with Miguel Cotto, becoming a fourth division world champion. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2714.54s)]
*  So, you know, the team even asked for a percentage of that. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2725.26s)]
*  I'm not giving nobody a little four down the road. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2727.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2729.58s)]
*  They had sanctioning fees and all that stuff. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2730.14s)]
*  So, yeah, it's been a journey. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2732.98s)]
*  I got paid a peanuts. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2734.94s)]
*  Like sometimes I got paid nothing, just to fight, just to stay, to maintain. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2736.98s)]
*  But yeah, that's the difference with Jake Paul and these women. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2742.9s)]
*  Now that they see that we're making, me and Katie making millions or just making noise. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2746.7799999999997s)]
*  And my fan base, how much it grew being under Jake Paul. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2752.18s)]
*  There, now they want to come along. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2756.62s)]
*  But I guess they have to see what was what he really wanted to do with female boxing. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2759.2999999999997s)]
*  And he proved it. He proved it with me. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2765.06s)]
*  And now he's proven it. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2766.94s)]
*  Come July 11th, the first in history at MSG on Netflix. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2768.22s)]
*  I am super proud to be part of that. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2773.54s)]
*  And like I said before, this is going to be a car you don't want to miss [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2775.62s)]
*  because we have two on the Sputum Championship, three unified championship. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2779.14s)]
*  And you just don't know who is going to be the fighter of the night. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2785.02s)]
*  Now, you recently pushed for 12, three minute rounds of women's boxing. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2788.3s)]
*  Pushed that hard. Why so? Why so much? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2791.38s)]
*  Because we we talk about equality in the sport of female boxing. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2794.02s)]
*  And one way to do it is is to fight the same time the men fight. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2797.82s)]
*  You know, we fight. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2803.26s)]
*  So some men complain that, oh, well, they fight less than us. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2804.66s)]
*  They're going to win this round. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2807.94s)]
*  Why you want to get paid just like us? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2809.82s)]
*  So I believe it's one step. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2811.7400000000002s)]
*  We want equality. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2813.3s)]
*  So we have to fight for what we believe, for what we want. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2814.2200000000003s)]
*  And I'm a big advocate for the 12, three. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2817.5400000000004s)]
*  Katie, she said the rematch, she said she shook my hand and said that we can [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2821.46s)]
*  if we fight again, we can do it. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2826.34s)]
*  And she neglects that promise. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2828.3s)]
*  So, I mean, we were fighting ten to, but I would prefer [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2831.7400000000002s)]
*  12, three, because I believe if I had that extra minute, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2835.98s)]
*  I can definitely hurt and finish her. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2838.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think a lot of us women would want that because we have a lot more time [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2840.86s)]
*  to show our skills. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2846.06s)]
*  I believe that the ten twos is like a sprint for women's boxing. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2847.1800000000003s)]
*  And then the 12, three is like a little jog and marathon. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2851.1800000000003s)]
*  We can showcase more of our skills and have more time to get these knockouts. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2854.7400000000002s)]
*  Rumor has it, you're the reason why Netflix wanted to stay in boxing [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2860.26s)]
*  after the first fight in Texas, like how entertaining your fight was [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2864.26s)]
*  with Jake Paul and Mike, opposed to the others. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2868.46s)]
*  I mean, look, you know, Jake Paul and Mike, they were what they were, right? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2871.46s)]
*  It was a unique type of fight. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2874.58s)]
*  But Netflix said, no, we need to see that again. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2876.46s)]
*  And that's why you fight on Netflix. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2879.02s)]
*  Is that true? Is there some truth to that? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2880.46s)]
*  Well, I mean, the birdie said, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2882.06s)]
*  no, yeah, I mean, that's what I want to do every time. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2885.46s)]
*  My trainer, Jordan Maldonado, he told me whenever you have [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2889.2200000000003s)]
*  an opportunity, you seize the opportunity. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2893.66s)]
*  And you do whatever you have to do to make sure that people tune in, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2896.38s)]
*  people watch you, people want you. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2900.42s)]
*  And I knew that fight. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2902.7000000000003s)]
*  I knew the fight with Katie Taylor was going to be a great fight. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2903.62s)]
*  So I said, no matter what I do, I have to just give it my all that that night. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2906.38s)]
*  And I did. And look, now Netflix believed in me and Katie so much [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2910.2200000000003s)]
*  that they gave us our own card with all women. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2915.38s)]
*  So they believe in us women. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2918.98s)]
*  And that's something that really touches me and that really gets me excited [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2920.58s)]
*  because now we have these big networks, big stadiums, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2923.7s)]
*  big people, big sponsors that are giving their money, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2928.3799999999997s)]
*  giving their time to promote and to just give us the spotlight. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2932.5s)]
*  And I'm excited. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2936.98s)]
*  And we're talking to boxer Amanda Serrano. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2938.22s)]
*  Her fight is July 11th at Madison Square Garden. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2940.7s)]
*  You won seven divisions. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2943.7s)]
*  This is obviously a big money fight, a big profile fight. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2945.74s)]
*  But if you do get the victory finally with Katie, what's the next challenge? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2949.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, I know people talking about Alicia Baumgarner. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2953.06s)]
*  She's with MVP now. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2956.54s)]
*  She's around your weight class. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2957.74s)]
*  What's the next big challenge for Amanda? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2959.66s)]
*  You know what the world wants. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2961.54s)]
*  No, honestly, right now, I'm just concentrating, fully concentrating on Katie Taylor. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2963.14s)]
*  That's the one thing that's on my mind, my goal, just to go out there [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2967.94s)]
*  and finally get this win. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2972.7s)]
*  That's a big enough challenge for me right now. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2973.82s)]
*  This moment, this second, this whole couple of weeks leading up to the fight. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2975.94s)]
*  And then after that, who knows? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2979.94s)]
*  Who knows what the world holds for me? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2982.22s)]
*  The team knows. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2983.8599999999997s)]
*  And I mean, they will go back and we'll figure it out. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2984.74s)]
*  When you when you retire, what do you want little Puerto Rican girls to say? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2988.14s)]
*  When they mention that sounds funny. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2991.14s)]
*  Not just only little Puerto Rican girls. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2995.02s)]
*  I need a little girl or boy who who believes in themselves and want to do something. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=2997.18s)]
*  Just you have to go out there and give it your all. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3003.18s)]
*  You know, I greatness requires sacrifice. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3005.66s)]
*  I sacrifice my whole life to the sport. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3008.06s)]
*  And I'm going to continue to work for them and just believe in yourself. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3011.42s)]
*  Surround yourself with positive people. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3015.5s)]
*  Go out there and give it your all. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3017.1400000000003s)]
*  That's all I can ask. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3018.98s)]
*  And I always tell the young girls, they say, I want to be like you. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3019.86s)]
*  And I tell them, don't be like me. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3022.7000000000003s)]
*  Be better than me. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3024.1800000000003s)]
*  And that's what I want to push them for. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3025.3s)]
*  Just always to be better than than me. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3026.9s)]
*  And that's what I do. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3029.34s)]
*  I always want to be better than I was yesterday or the fight before. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3030.38s)]
*  And that's all you have to do. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3034.42s)]
*  You're going to have Bad Bunny or Johnson and Hernandez throughout. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3035.86s)]
*  Which one? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3040.26s)]
*  David to Puerto Rico stars. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3041.7400000000002s)]
*  Bad Bunny has a concert, the same his first concert in Puerto Rico is the night of the fight. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3043.5s)]
*  So, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3048.5800000000004s)]
*  Jocelyn, what about Jocelyn Hernandez? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3051.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, she's coming. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3053.42s)]
*  Jocelyn drops some balls. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3054.82s)]
*  She had a float in the Puerto Rican. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3057.1800000000003s)]
*  I bet she did. That's my Puerto Rican princess right there. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3058.5400000000004s)]
*  So I say she can walk you down. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3061.7400000000002s)]
*  Is the Katie Taylor chapter closed after this third fight? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3063.98s)]
*  Is that you done? I think so. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3067.6600000000003s)]
*  Win or lose? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3069.34s)]
*  I think so. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3070.42s)]
*  You know, honestly, I said that after the second one. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3071.7000000000003s)]
*  After the first one, I was like, God, I am so tired of it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3074.7400000000002s)]
*  I love Katie. Katie is my best friend. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3077.42s)]
*  But I'm like, how can you love and hate someone at the same time? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3079.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because I last press conference, I'd never seen y'all go at it the way you did. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3082.94s)]
*  She threw shots saying you're delusional. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3086.58s)]
*  And you came with the helmet. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3088.86s)]
*  Was there football helmet? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3091.58s)]
*  Or head gear to the press conference incinerating. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3093.06s)]
*  I don't want to get hit with. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3095.98s)]
*  So this is not as friendly as it was before. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3096.98s)]
*  That was just something that was just. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3101.14s)]
*  It was a good idea. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3102.9s)]
*  But then the day after we had to do like promo and photo shoot, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3104.14s)]
*  and we were just laughing and talking like regular. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3107.26s)]
*  But yeah, I think she's kind of probably tired of me. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3110.5s)]
*  Tired of me. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3113.3s)]
*  What if you beat her and she says, I want two, you want one, let's do it again. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3114.3s)]
*  Damn. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3118.1s)]
*  Money talks. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3120.94s)]
*  Money talks. But like, honestly, I'm like, I told myself, I said, God. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3122.2200000000003s)]
*  Because it's been like, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3125.94s)]
*  I'll talk to both of our names since she turned pro. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3128.18s)]
*  We wasn't even the same weight class at the same. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3131.74s)]
*  Well, I was never at her same weight class. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3133.94s)]
*  I'm like, who is Katie? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3136.54s)]
*  But Katie Taylor's brought eyes to the professional boxing world, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3138.22s)]
*  which is good. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3143.1s)]
*  But it's been like that for years. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3144.58s)]
*  I was like, oh, my God. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3146.82s)]
*  I'm kind of tired of Katie Taylor. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3147.86s)]
*  Well, we all know what the ultimate payday is. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3150.38s)]
*  I don't know what that weight would be between you and Clarissa. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3151.94s)]
*  But that would be the ultimate payday and the ultimate match of women's boxing. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3154.02s)]
*  Listen, it can be. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3157.5s)]
*  But just like I said, I'm here promoting July 11th. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3159.94s)]
*  And it's just. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3164.78s)]
*  But would you go to 147? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3165.98s)]
*  Forget about would you. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3167.66s)]
*  You're almost there. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3169.46s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3170.3s)]
*  I'm not almost there. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3172.38s)]
*  I can barely make 140. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3173.2200000000003s)]
*  And this fight is at 140. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3175.3s)]
*  You look bralette. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3176.5s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's good for eating, good eating and training hard. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3177.3s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not I'm not a natural 140, a natural 135. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3181.34s)]
*  I'm a natural 126. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3185.3s)]
*  I walk around at 134. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3187.02s)]
*  So like I said, going up in weight is really hard for me. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3188.94s)]
*  It's a lot harder for me than losing weight. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3191.7000000000003s)]
*  And people look at me like I'm crazy, like, oh, my God, losing weight is hard. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3193.46s)]
*  No, gaining weight for me. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3196.78s)]
*  Yeah, you're late. You got fast metabolism. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3198.02s)]
*  I'm constantly working hard and training hard. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3199.86s)]
*  I sweat so much and I lose. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3202.1400000000003s)]
*  I lose weight so fast. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3204.1400000000003s)]
*  So I'm like, no, like, but you can make 147 if you had to. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3205.5s)]
*  No, I know I can't. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3209.3s)]
*  I won't. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3210.82s)]
*  The heavier you go, the more you lose. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3215.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. And my power is still there. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3218.82s)]
*  But like I said, these 20 million, you won't go to 147. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3220.5800000000004s)]
*  I know. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3223.7400000000002s)]
*  20 million, I go to 147. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3226.38s)]
*  You could whip his ass. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3229.98s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3231.78s)]
*  How does it feel when you walk in the gym sometime and know you better than 99 percent of the men? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3232.5s)]
*  It boosts your confidence. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3236.5800000000004s)]
*  Like sometimes I walk around the street and I'm like, only if they knew. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3238.78s)]
*  Well, we wish you the best of luck. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3244.42s)]
*  You're fighting Madison Square Garden July 11th. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3245.5800000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3248.1400000000003s)]
*  All my Puerto Ricans, but equals go buy your tickets, get out there and support. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3248.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes, I'm saying right now, because I was on the floor last year. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3252.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3254.1000000000004s)]
*  We're making history. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3255.7000000000003s)]
*  All women's card. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3256.6600000000003s)]
*  Great fights. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3258.3s)]
*  Honestly, we me and Katie had two great fights. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3260.06s)]
*  But I don't know, we are up for some good competition this fight. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3263.1800000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3267.3s)]
*  Well, thank you for joining us. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3267.78s)]
*  Amanda Serrano. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3269.2200000000003s)]

*  It's the Breakfast Club. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3270.9s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3271.7000000000003s)]
*  Frank Ocean and Kanye might have been kissing while they were recording this. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3272.06s)]
*  You ever think about stuff like this? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3274.9s)]
*  No, one of my favorite songs. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3276.1400000000003s)]
*  Tough. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3277.6200000000003s)]
*  In the world is tough. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3278.06s)]
*  Very tough. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3279.06s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3279.7000000000003s)]
*  Very tough. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3280.3s)]
*  I never thought about them two kissing. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3280.82s)]
*  That me neither. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3282.6600000000003s)]
*  I just thought about it. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3283.38s)]
*  I'm like, damn, Frank Ocean was killing that hook with penis on his breath. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3284.26s)]
*  Probably what Frank Ocean, though. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3286.98s)]
*  We don't even know what was going on. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3290.1400000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3292.78s)]
*  Anyway, let's get to the latest. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3293.1800000000003s)]
*  Brian, hey, yo. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3295.3399999999997s)]
*  Lauren will be coming with straight facts. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3296.74s)]
*  Tell her, tell her. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3298.74s)]
*  Man it. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3299.74s)]
*  She gets into somebody that knows somebody. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3300.22s)]
*  She gets to details. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3302.22s)]
*  I'm the homegirl that knows a little bit about everything. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3303.22s)]
*  She'll be having the latest on this. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3306.22s)]
*  The largest. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3308.22s)]
*  The latest with Lauren LaRosa. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3309.7s)]
*  Sometimes you have facts, sometimes you have details, sometimes you have a little bit of everything. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3311.42s)]
*  But what's the latest? [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3314.8199999999997s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3315.8199999999997s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3316.8199999999997s)]
*  All right, y'all. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3318.8199999999997s)]
*  A bit more, a few more moments from the BET Awards last night. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3319.54s)]
*  Dolce won best female hip hop artist and she took the stage in a powerful acceptance speech. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3322.8199999999997s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Dolce. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3328.3399999999997s)]
*  First of all, thank you so much, BET. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3330.14s)]
*  This is my first BET Awards. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3332.4199999999996s)]
*  So this means a lot to me. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3333.8199999999997s)]
*  I grew up watching this. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3334.9399999999996s)]
*  But as much as I'm honored by this award, I do want to address what's happening right now outside of the building. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3336.3399999999997s)]
*  There are ruthless attacks that are creating fear and chaos. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3343.7s)]
*  Trump is using military forces to stop a protest. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3348.02s)]
*  And I want you all to consider what kind of government it appears to be when every time we exercise our democratic right to protest, the military is deployed against us. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3352.62s)]
*  People are being swept up and torn from their families. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3362.94s)]
*  And I feel it's my responsibility as an artist to use this moment to speak up for all oppressed people, for black people, for Latino people, for trans people, for the people in Gaza. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3366.5s)]
*  And I hope we stand together, my brothers and my sisters, against hate and we protest against it. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3377.38s)]
*  That's a solid way to use your platform. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3383.62s)]
*  I always feel like when stuff like that happens, though, like what's next after the artist does that? [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3385.1800000000003s)]
*  Like you raise the awareness, but what's the call to action? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3389.98s)]
*  And that had to be tough for BET producers because you have to either choose to ignore what's going on outside, you know, to put on your show. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3392.42s)]
*  That's it. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3401.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3402.34s)]
*  You either acknowledge it or ignore it. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3402.78s)]
*  But they didn't acknowledge it. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3405.22s)]
*  They just let whoever one acknowledge it, but they didn't necessarily acknowledge it. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3406.1s)]
*  I'm saying like, but for that being the backdrop of L.A., you would feel like, you know, that has to be a tough thing to decide to do in the room. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3409.54s)]
*  Correct. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3417.22s)]
*  You either acknowledge it or ignore it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3417.74s)]
*  Yeah, and it's hard to ignore it because when I tell you all weekend, we've had to be moving around the protest and like stores being broken, like so much different stuff. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3419.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, they definitely ignored it because I mean, they didn't do anything. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3428.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean, but I just mean if you're here in person, to your point, it should have bled over into the show because in real life, everybody is not there. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3431.82s)]
*  And we know, you know what I'm saying? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3439.26s)]
*  So it would have been great. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3440.5800000000004s)]
*  So in real life, it was you couldn't ignore it. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3441.46s)]
*  Or do you use the show as an escape? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3443.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3444.9s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3445.54s)]
*  That's why I said it's a tough decision for producers. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3446.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3447.6200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3448.5s)]
*  Now, also on the stage, the Ultimate Icon Award went down. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3449.26s)]
*  Snoop Dogg, Mariah Carey, Jamie Foxx, Kirk Franklin received this award. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3452.7400000000002s)]
*  Snoop Dogg's award was presented by Dr. Dre and Ultimate Icon Award is where these artists are recognized for their decades of contributions in music, entertainment, advocacy and community impact. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3456.8599999999997s)]
*  Let's take a listen to the performance that happened by Snoop Dogg when receiving this award. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3466.8999999999996s)]
*  Damn, he killed it. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3474.62s)]
*  They sounded good, too. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3475.94s)]
*  Like they sounded the same. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3477.42s)]
*  Backstage went crazy. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3479.54s)]
*  A lot of the crew last night was from LA, too. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3480.8999999999996s)]
*  Like they went crazy last night. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3483.58s)]
*  Especially when Corrupted the Stage and then Warranty the Stage as well, too. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3485.94s)]
*  Even the dancers, I'm sorry, the dancers and the people who were playing the instruments, like the band, everything. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3488.5s)]
*  I love how they had the tuxedos mixed with the LA flannel. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3493.54s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3498.78s)]
*  Like it was lit. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3499.46s)]
*  It was a whole thing for black people in the West Coast. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3500.58s)]
*  Ain't no fun if the homies can't have none. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3503.7000000000003s)]
*  It's all good till you hear that in the freak-off. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3505.38s)]
*  It was still classy. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3507.78s)]
*  You're stupid. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3508.98s)]
*  Jamie Foxx also was presented his Icon Award. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3511.38s)]
*  And Daz wasn't there. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3514.1s)]
*  We didn't see Daz Dillinger. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3514.82s)]
*  He didn't pull up Discorrupted. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3515.74s)]
*  But go ahead. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3517.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3517.9799999999996s)]
*  Jamie Foxx, he received his Impact Award from Stevie Wonder. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3518.9799999999996s)]
*  And he had all of us in tears while there. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3523.4199999999996s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Jamie Foxx. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3526.5s)]
*  I cannot even begin to express the love that I feel from everybody out there. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3528.14s)]
*  I got to be honest. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3536.14s)]
*  When I saw the memorandum, I was like, man, it could have been me. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3537.58s)]
*  But I don't know why I went through what I went through. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3540.9399999999996s)]
*  But I know my second chance, I'm not going to turn down. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3543.82s)]
*  I'm not going to turn down. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3548.86s)]
*  I have so much love to give. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3550.42s)]
*  I told him, I said, man, just just give me one more crack at this. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3552.5s)]
*  And I promise, I said, whatever reason you put this on me, I promise I'm going to do right. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3556.46s)]
*  When I did my special, it was from the black people. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3561.1400000000003s)]
*  Black people was the one that said, man, we got you. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3563.5s)]
*  Not to say that white people can't pray either. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3565.98s)]
*  I know that sounds weird, but you know what I'm saying. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3568.34s)]
*  It's like I know what you're saying. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3570.6200000000003s)]
*  It's like you guys held me down and I don't want to make this whole speech about that. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3571.86s)]
*  But you can't go through something like that and not testify. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3576.46s)]
*  Amazing speech he gave. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3581.1800000000003s)]
*  The funniest part was when Stevie Wonder came to hand him the trophy. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3582.86s)]
*  Because Stevie was awesome. Like, all right, bro, I'm old. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3586.1400000000003s)]
*  I can't be standing up here for this alone. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3588.98s)]
*  OK, yes. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3591.26s)]
*  And I love how he took it back. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3592.38s)]
*  Remember some years back when at an award show, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3593.58s)]
*  Elton John gave a tribute to Stevie Wonder and he said, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3596.1s)]
*  Stevie and Jamie Foxx had brought that moment back. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3599.54s)]
*  I thought that was pretty dope, too. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3602.94s)]
*  I didn't know what that was. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3604.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3605.22s)]
*  It was a long, long time ago. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3606.06s)]
*  Stevie, I mean, Jamie Foxx had joked Elton John for that. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3607.74s)]
*  Stevie was like, I love seeing you. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3612.66s)]
*  I love seeing you perform. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3614.02s)]
*  I love seeing you. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3615.58s)]
*  I love seeing the crowd. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3616.46s)]
*  Stevie Wonder got better vision than all of us. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3617.78s)]
*  You best believe that. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3620.42s)]
*  Stevie Foxx said, I had a joke, but I'm not going to say it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3621.62s)]
*  I believe Stevie alone. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3623.5s)]
*  But Tyler Perry also. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3625.14s)]
*  He still did the joke? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3626.54s)]
*  He still did. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3627.94s)]
*  I think he did. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3629.42s)]
*  He, he, he, he, well, he did a joke. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3630.06s)]
*  He did a joke. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3632.7s)]
*  When you were going during the round. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3633.7s)]
*  I thought it was going to be worse than that. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3635.02s)]
*  That was hilarious. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3637.02s)]
*  How you know? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3638.18s)]
*  It was so funny. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3638.82s)]
*  Even him. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3640.14s)]
*  Tyler Perry also hit the stage. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3642.86s)]
*  He brought out Lettucey, but he called out the Hollywood [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3644.46s)]
*  studios in a heavy flex. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3647.22s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3648.9s)]

*  They went into Tulsa, Oklahoma and tried to burn down [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3677.1s)]
*  Black Wall Street. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3679.42s)]

*  I still can't help not to hear Madea every time. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3700.54s)]
*  Every time you get passionate, I hear Madea. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3703.58s)]

*  What do you mean? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3959.58s)]
*  Pastor Powell was charged with first degree robbery. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3961.06s)]
*  Uncle Sharla, my pastor don't have to steal from nobody. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3963.3s)]
*  We be having two, sometimes three collections on Sundays. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3965.98s)]
*  The general offering, the special offering [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3969.9s)]
*  to build the church pool, and a thank you offering for our pastor, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3971.78s)]
*  because he is a good man. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3974.9s)]
*  He needs a new Hyundai Sonata. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3976.26s)]
*  So my pastor don't got no reason to rob nobody. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3978.14s)]
*  Well, let's go to Fox 10 News for the report, please. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3980.8199999999997s)]
*  Tonight, a well-known local pastor [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3983.14s)]
*  is out of jail, charged with first degree robbery. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3985.7s)]
*  Investigators say 72-year-old Roy Powell [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3989.74s)]
*  took a man's book bag at gunpoint yesterday morning [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3992.8599999999997s)]
*  on Mobile Street. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3996.3799999999997s)]
*  The alleged victim, who doesn't want to be identified, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=3998.02s)]
*  tells me he was walking to the post office [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4001.1s)]
*  when Powell was walking towards him on the sidewalk [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4003.3799999999997s)]
*  and bumped into him. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4006.74s)]
*  He said he was like, you was in my way. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4008.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm walking down the sidewalk. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4009.8999999999996s)]
*  Watch where you're going. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4011.14s)]
*  And we had words back and forth. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4012.14s)]
*  The alleged victim tells me Powell left the scene [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4014.22s)]
*  after they exchanged words. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4017.18s)]
*  Minutes later, he tells me Powell came back in a truck [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4019.1s)]
*  and with a gun that he used to pistol-whip the man in the head. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4022.66s)]
*  According to this sign at the Cedar Street Missionary Baptist [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4027.3399999999997s)]
*  Church, Powell is a pastor here. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4030.62s)]
*  And court documents say he's been a pastor for 30 years. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4033.42s)]
*  These court documents say Powell actually went back [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4038.46s)]
*  to the scene to apologize. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4041.1s)]
*  He's charged with first degree robbery. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4043.7400000000002s)]
*  What if heaven was hell and vice versa? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4046.1s)]
*  It's too corrupt knowing that God [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4048.38s)]
*  going to help me blow him up. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4049.86s)]
*  That wasn't Pastor Roy. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4051.02s)]
*  That was Pastor Troy. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4052.3s)]
*  And Pastor Troy was teaching that young man a lesson. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4053.42s)]
*  See, this is what happens when you don't tithe, OK? [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4056.02s)]
*  Tithing is not a strict requirement for salvation. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4060.1400000000003s)]
*  But it is seen as a test of faith, OK? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4062.42s)]
*  Pastor say, you're going to give up that 10%. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4064.2200000000003s)]
*  In my mind, that's how this happened, OK? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4067.02s)]
*  Pastor Powell walking down the street. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4069.54s)]
*  They bump into each other. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4071.2200000000003s)]
*  Pastor says, you was in my way. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4072.42s)]
*  The devil got busy and made that young man have a back and forth. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4073.9s)]
*  Pastor Powell said, I know God protects me, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4077.1800000000003s)]
*  but I still stay with my dad. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4079.1s)]
*  So according to the victim, he left the scene. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4080.38s)]
*  Now I'm going to tell you what happened. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4082.38s)]
*  I'm going to tell you what happened. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4083.98s)]
*  This is just in my mind. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4084.66s)]
*  Pastor Powell went home and prayed over his pistol. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4085.62s)]
*  He then proceeded to grab his holy hammer, his godly glock. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4088.54s)]
*  Then he went back to confront this heathen, who don't be tithing, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4091.9s)]
*  and proceeded to pistol whip this man in the name of Jesus. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4095.38s)]
*  OK, divine discipline is what it's called. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4098.66s)]
*  Now in the Bible, Romans 12, 19, it says, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4100.7s)]
*  Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4103.06s)]
*  For it is written, vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4106.58s)]
*  That's what made Pastor Roy return to the scene of the crime [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4110.46s)]
*  and apologize, because he knew in that moment he let the devil use him. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4113.14s)]
*  But again, I ask, what if heaven was hell and vice versa? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4117.06s)]
*  Would you start doing evil in order to nurture? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4120.0199999999995s)]
*  He had to apologize because that's the Christian way. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4122.139999999999s)]
*  Acknowledge the wrong and express remorse. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4124.94s)]
*  Got to ask for forgiveness after you pistol whip somebody, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4127.379999999999s)]
*  not just from God, but from others, especially the person you hurt. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4129.9s)]
*  Then you repent. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4134.099999999999s)]
*  OK, you got to make a sincere effort to change and avoid repeating the mistake. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4135.259999999999s)]
*  But Pastor Roy 72, if this is true, that wasn't his first pistol whipping, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4139.179999999999s)]
*  and it won't be his last, especially if y'all don't go to church [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4143.62s)]
*  and give up that 10 percent. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4147.139999999999s)]
*  I don't feel like I gave him the credit he deserved for being stupid, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4150.0199999999995s)]
*  but it's because what if heaven was hell and vice versa? [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4152.0599999999995s)]
*  Please give Pastor Roy Powell the biggest he-ho. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4154.94s)]
*  Y'all better tithe. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4161.299999999999s)]
*  That's right. I do every Sunday. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4163.299999999999s)]
*  You better. I do. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4165.259999999999s)]
*  All right. Well, thank you for that donkey today, sir. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4167.54s)]
*  Now, when we come back, we have a gentleman by the name of Harry O. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4170.74s)]

*  Yes. What is that? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4227.78s)]
*  Great question. So the art of calculated communication. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4229.38s)]
*  Let me just rewind a little bit for the room who may not know or those [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4231.860000000001s)]
*  who don't know in the room that besides an entertainment executive, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4236.14s)]
*  I'm also a college professor [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4240.02s)]
*  and I've been teaching communication courses for maybe 12 to 13 years. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4242.26s)]
*  If you don't go that far, let's go all the way back. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4247.42s)]
*  I had no idea. Yeah, I didn't either. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4249.18s)]
*  You know, Harry O. was started off as a rapper. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4251.58s)]
*  Yes, that's how I originally know Harry O. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4253.900000000001s)]
*  He's from High Bridge. He's from the Bronx. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4255.740000000001s)]
*  He started off as a rapper from there and was and was signed to the Inc. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4257.22s)]
*  Yes, signed to the Inc. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4261.02s)]
*  You was a hype man for Jairo for many years. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4262.1s)]
*  And then you start rapping and now breaking that. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4265.58s)]
*  Well, first of all, how did you meet Irv and everybody and go through that whole [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4267.54s)]
*  list of things? Great question. So let me rewind. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4271.82s)]
*  Right. So first, I started the entertainment business. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4273.54s)]
*  I had a deal with Uptown Records first [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4275.62s)]
*  with Andre Harrell and everyone over there. God bless the dead. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4278.86s)]
*  My favorite label ever. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4281.099999999999s)]
*  Favorite favorite, right? Best for R&B music. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4282.5s)]
*  All right. So I was maybe like an eighth grade. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4285.3s)]
*  So that came when then I was working with Puff for a while. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4286.94s)]
*  Whoa. Oh, that bad boy. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4290.62s)]
*  Yeah. Listen, I know my guys going through a lot, [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4291.94s)]
*  but I got to give him a lot of credit for helping me of where I'm at today. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4294.42s)]
*  Like, I have to give him his credit because I probably wouldn't be here [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4298.06s)]
*  without the image of him. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4301.18s)]
*  All right. But we can't take away what he did professionally. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4302.82s)]
*  Professionally and what he and what he did for me in my life person. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4304.900000000001s)]
*  He did a lot for me. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4307.46s)]
*  And I tell you about if I have time, like he stuck up for me [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4308.5s)]
*  plenty of times when executive tried to blackball me and things like that. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4311.02s)]
*  Puff found out about it. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4314.62s)]
*  Step in like, you know, you're not doing that to my guy. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4315.82s)]
*  So I got to give him this credit. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4318.14s)]
*  So from there, we transitioned quick. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4320.42s)]
*  I had to deal with Motown. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4321.94s)]
*  They had to deal with Murder Inc. Right. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4323.419999999999s)]
*  How many deals do you have? Four deals. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4325.099999999999s)]
*  OK, starting at eighth grade, starting in eighth grade, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4327.339999999999s)]
*  starting in eighth grade, like I've been doing entertainment for a long time. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4330.179999999999s)]
*  So now, that's what I'm going to tell you as far as me and John. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4333.46s)]
*  I met John on the set of a movie called Turn It Up. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4336.86s)]
*  We remember turning it up. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4341.219999999999s)]
*  Right. You're not going to remember me in the movie [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4342.299999999999s)]
*  because they added me out. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4344.299999999999s)]
*  So you're not going to remember me. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4345.82s)]
*  But if you look at the credits, you'll see me in the credits or whatever. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4347.66s)]
*  So the movie was shot in Canada. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4351.46s)]
*  So we traveled to Canada. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4354.22s)]
*  I'm there with my manager. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4355.820000000001s)]
*  We're trying to get into Canada. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4357.34s)]
*  My manager at the time, he gets arrested for some reason. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4358.860000000001s)]
*  He can't get into Canada. You know how that goes. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4361.14s)]
*  So now I'm just I'm young. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4362.78s)]
*  I'm in Canada about to shoot this movie. I'm by myself. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4364.62s)]
*  I'm a little nervous. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4367.34s)]
*  So my trailer is right next to Josh trailer. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4368.26s)]
*  But I would always see John in the violator office [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4370.62s)]
*  because we was working with Violator Def Jam, but we never really, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4373.66s)]
*  you know, knew each other. We saw each other. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4376.38s)]
*  We passed. So I'm in a trailer. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4377.9400000000005s)]
*  He knocks on my trailer door. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4379.78s)]
*  So I open up, he go, oh, you sign a Def Jam. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4381.74s)]
*  You sign a violator. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4384.5s)]
*  I'm like, no, my God, my son is and we doing work over there. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4385.3s)]
*  He go, man, I hear you here by yourself and your manager got arrested. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4388.259999999999s)]
*  Listen, anything you need, come to my trailer. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4390.98s)]
*  If you need weed, if you need Hennessy, if you need anything. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4394.34s)]
*  John has been trying to get me high since I met him. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4397.7s)]
*  Right. Right. Yeah, I don't do any of that. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4399.82s)]
*  So from there, John and I had a connection. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4401.42s)]
*  That was his first album, like right before his first album came out. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4404.54s)]
*  After his album came out, he like blew up and took off. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4407.9s)]
*  And, you know, my career was going wherever it was going. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4410.66s)]
*  But any time we would see each other, it would like we would stop everything [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4413.22s)]
*  and give each other love. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4416.94s)]
*  And then I met Chris Gotti, Irv's brother, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4418.34s)]
*  somewhere in the club, and he knew I did music. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4421.5s)]
*  He said, listen, why don't you come down to the studio? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4423.54s)]
*  Went to the studio, started recording records with Irv, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4425.98s)]
*  records with Ashanti, records with John. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4429.66s)]
*  The next, you know, a brotherhood form where although me and John [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4431.98s)]
*  came in through entertainment, that's more my brother. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4435.74s)]
*  Like that's that's my guy. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4438.7s)]
*  And I said before my company, Chase Republic, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4439.98s)]
*  we serve as like an independent agency for him. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4442.7s)]
*  We close a lot of different deals like I do with you, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4445.26s)]
*  even when we talk about made a lot of money together. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4447.7s)]
*  But more importantly, that's that's my brother. That's my guy. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4449.94s)]
*  So now so now you get out of music and music never takes off. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4452.94s)]
*  You can look at it that way. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4456.86s)]
*  Right. You tell me. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4458.179999999999s)]
*  Well, I had the transition. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4459.3s)]
*  I always say this, right. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4461.5s)]
*  Somebody can ask you, like, how do you view success? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4462.86s)]
*  Right. So in your eyes, you may say, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4465.7s)]
*  Harry, you know, as an artist wasn't successful. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4467.94s)]
*  And that's fine. You can see it that way. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4471.5s)]
*  I don't view it that way. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4472.78s)]
*  I view it as I came in an entertainment business in eighth grade. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4473.66s)]
*  I made a life out of it. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4478.26s)]
*  I'm sitting here doing an interview on the Breakfast Club. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4480.58s)]
*  Not a rapper. I'm not always known as an executive. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4483.26s)]
*  Like I always looked at Harry. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4486.98s)]
*  I was an executive. I never I never even knew anything about. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4488.42s)]
*  Well, like the E being a DJ. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4490.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's been plenty of times where like I would have to wait for E [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4493.14s)]
*  outside of the radio station for to get music played. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4496.34s)]
*  Like we have that relationship. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4498.46s)]
*  You and I met later on in life as being an entertainment executive. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4500.5s)]
*  Same thing with Lauren. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4504.06s)]
*  Like you and I met first conversation I had with you is this. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4505.1s)]
*  Listen, I'll probably make some money with you. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4507.7s)]
*  Right. And that's how it went. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4509.7s)]
*  But he just knows a little bit of the backstory. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4511.1s)]
*  But yeah, so it all depends on how you want to look at it as far as [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4513.34s)]
*  you're not being successful. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4517.22s)]
*  But I made a life for it. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4518.38s)]
*  My daughter, listen, I paid her tuition as entertainment. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4520.34s)]
*  Do you understand her private school tuition, which we all know is very expensive [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4523.74s)]
*  all through entertainment. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4527.34s)]
*  So someone asks, hey, weren't you weren't successful? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4528.62s)]
*  I don't know. I wouldn't say that. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4531.74s)]
*  I think pretty well. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4533.22s)]
*  You probably asked this. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4534.14s)]
*  Then I'm interested in also from the artist's perspective. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4535.5s)]
*  Then you transition into the executive side because of the relationships. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4537.82s)]
*  And what is that transition? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4540.38s)]
*  Because you started at eight. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4541.42s)]
*  An executive is an adult making real adult decisions. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4542.62s)]
*  Right. Well, it's it's two folds to it. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4544.82s)]
*  Right. As I said, I've been a college professor. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4547.860000000001s)]
*  Teaching communication courses now with communication, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4550.18s)]
*  understand the art of connecting with others. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4553.1s)]
*  But first connecting with yourself and we talk about once I understood [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4556.1s)]
*  and fully came up who I am, a higher sense of awareness of me. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4559.740000000001s)]
*  I understood my abilities. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4564.780000000001s)]
*  I understood how I can build relationships. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4566.46s)]
*  So I just started to build and form credible relationships with people, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4568.860000000001s)]
*  building trust, but in a strategic way, not in a manipulative way, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4572.820000000001s)]
*  just very strategic. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4576.42s)]
*  And like I can talk a lot about me and me [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4577.5s)]
*  because I made some money together and our relationship built. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4579.74s)]
*  And I was intentional on how we're building our relationship. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4583.46s)]
*  So what I did was I just merged the world between entertainment [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4586.86s)]
*  and education and made life. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4590.86s)]
*  So what is the art of calculated communication and how that helped you [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4593.94s)]
*  navigate through all those different world? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4597.42s)]
*  So the art of calculated communication, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4598.78s)]
*  what I would do is this right, say with Lauren, for instance, right. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4601.74s)]
*  I met Lauren at the Brooklyn Nets event. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4604.7s)]
*  Now, I understand it takes more than one encounter [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4606.74s)]
*  for us to start building some type of relationship. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4612.22s)]
*  But we have to have that first encounter. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4614.9s)]
*  I have to be a genuine encounter. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4617.099999999999s)]
*  It has to be maybe someone can help build that bridge between you and I. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4619.3s)]
*  And I use June June and his manager, whoever's listening. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4622.58s)]
*  I said, June, do me a favor. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4626.26s)]
*  Let her know. Stamp me. Right. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4627.62s)]
*  Let her know. So June went to you and said, hey, Harry, oh, this is my guy. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4629.62s)]
*  That's all I needed to start building some type of communication with you. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4633.22s)]
*  In order for Lauren and I to build a relationship, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4637.3s)]
*  I have to get her to peel back her layers. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4639.860000000001s)]
*  I have to try to get to know her. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4642.46s)]
*  The closer I get to her, the more of a chance I have of doing great business with her. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4644.06s)]
*  I just can't pick up the phone and say, hey, I have a bunch of deals for you. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4648.9800000000005s)]
*  She doesn't even know who I am yet. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4651.700000000001s)]
*  We have to build trust. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4652.820000000001s)]
*  So I have to get her to peel back layers. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4654.06s)]
*  I have to ask her questions. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4655.540000000001s)]
*  But if she never responds like, say if I say, hey, as simple as this, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4657.18s)]
*  Lauren, how was your day today? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4661.34s)]
*  Great. So far, besides dealing with Charlamagne, but other than that, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4663.06s)]
*  I'm the best part of her day. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4666.34s)]
*  As far as the day. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4667.38s)]
*  What are your plans tomorrow? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4668.54s)]
*  We have a flight. Wow. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4670.18s)]
*  Well, not them, but the producers and stuff. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4671.5s)]
*  Now, check this out. Right. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4673.54s)]
*  So I would have to work a little bit harder now with Lauren, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4675.02s)]
*  because although I actually squashed and I know we're on air a lot going on. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4679.46s)]
*  I asked her how was her day. Right. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4683.900000000001s)]
*  And she said how was they was. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4686.1s)]
*  She didn't say how was yours, too. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4687.58s)]
*  Oh, shoot. Sorry. So [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4689.74s)]
*  that's I'm anticipating the next question. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4693.38s)]
*  I know. I know it's fine. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4695.46s)]
*  I'm interested in knowing about her day, but I want to see how much [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4696.54s)]
*  interest she's holding in me to know about me as well. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4700.34s)]
*  And sooner or later, that will come. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4703.38s)]
*  This is our maybe like our second encounter. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4704.66s)]
*  But if I can't get you to have that exchange with me, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4706.9s)]
*  I have to work a lot harder and be more strategic [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4709.62s)]
*  and to get you to communicate with me. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4712.34s)]
*  And if you never do that, it's like, all right, this person doesn't have any [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4714.5s)]
*  interest in building with me in this area. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4717.82s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Harry O. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4720.58s)]
*  Harry O. is a professor, ex-Murder Inc. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4722.259999999999s)]
*  artist as well. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4725.139999999999s)]
*  And how did Irv Gotti's death affect you, bro? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4726.5s)]
*  The passing of him. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4728.78s)]
*  I see how it affects me and everyone around. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4730.34s)]
*  Like, I am very, very, very close with Jah. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4732.46s)]
*  Right. And Irv and I were really cool, but I'm closer with Jah. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4735.0199999999995s)]
*  It affect me because in this way, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4738.46s)]
*  no one may not know this outside of his family. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4741.219999999999s)]
*  Irv is such a family, family man. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4744.379999999999s)]
*  I have never seen a family as close as his in my life. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4748.5s)]
*  I've never seen it. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4754.0599999999995s)]
*  So and he was like the hero of the family. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4755.54s)]
*  And for and no disrespect to anyone else in the family that's doing great things. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4759.66s)]
*  But he was like a hero. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4764.66s)]
*  And so for the hero to pass and see how that affects the family dynamic, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4766.259999999999s)]
*  it made me how it affects me, it made me come closer with my family. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4772.06s)]
*  Like Irv is the type where, listen, it was holidays. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4775.78s)]
*  His house is packed with the whole family. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4780.26s)]
*  Not just him and the kids, his nieces, his nephews, his aunts and uncles. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4783.54s)]
*  It's like 30 people running around his house. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4787.900000000001s)]
*  And it was just a loving, loving, loving family. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4790.34s)]
*  A lot of people didn't see that side of him. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4793.22s)]
*  You see Murder Inc. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4794.46s)]
*  You see the music or you see the problems with the 50 Cent or whatever. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4795.54s)]
*  So on and so forth. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4798.62s)]
*  But the guy was an amazing family man. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4799.74s)]
*  And to watch that and as a father, it affects me. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4803.42s)]
*  It's like, I want to be closer with my family the way Irv is with his family. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4806.099999999999s)]
*  So that's how I would say it affects me. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4809.78s)]
*  You know, it's interesting when you talk about the art of communication. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4811.099999999999s)]
*  Like, I like the way Irv communicated. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4814.179999999999s)]
*  It may have rubbed some people the wrong way, but I like it because it's direct. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4817.3s)]
*  Like when we talked about how, you know, it was intentional. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4820.82s)]
*  He wasn't the small talker. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4823.5s)]
*  It was this is what we doing. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4825.42s)]
*  This is how we doing it. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4827.139999999999s)]
*  This is how I think it should go. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4828.0199999999995s)]
*  Right. I like that. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4829.26s)]
*  No, listen, absolutely. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4830.26s)]
*  It's something to be admired there. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4832.02s)]
*  Everyone has different strategies on how they communicate. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4834.860000000001s)]
*  Irv being direct may work for him with certain people, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4838.14s)]
*  but I'm quite sure it didn't work with every one. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4843.3s)]
*  Right. But so it all depends on what your style is. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4847.42s)]
*  And I was thinking about something. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4851.06s)]
*  Yeah, some people don't like small talk and that's fine. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4852.860000000001s)]
*  Like in the book, I mentioned a term called farming and hunting. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4855.74s)]
*  Those are different ways of nurturing a relationship. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4859.82s)]
*  When we're cutting a small talk out, I'm hunting. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4862.94s)]
*  I know exactly what I want. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4865.38s)]
*  I know what you have. You know, we can make that work. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4866.98s)]
*  But every relation doesn't work like that. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4868.82s)]
*  Sometimes we have to farm. We have to plant seeds. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4870.82s)]
*  I don't know where the relationship may go, but I know we can possibly build. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4874.22s)]
*  So I'm a plant seeds. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4878.86s)]
*  Then we just water the seeds, water the seeds. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4880.54s)]
*  And next, you know, we're eating off the fruit from the seeds. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4883.3s)]
*  And it's really important. Yes, I'm an entertainment executive. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4886.900000000001s)]
*  So all we're talking about is how these theories affect in business. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4889.54s)]
*  It's in your personal life as well. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4893.780000000001s)]
*  If a young man is trying to get to know a young lady or vice versa, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4896.02s)]
*  it's ways you go about that. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4900.02s)]
*  You have to be intentional. You have to be strategic. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4902.18s)]
*  Yes. What is your goal by dating this woman? That's transaction. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4905.1s)]
*  Cut the small talk. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4908.18s)]
*  It doesn't work like that in your personal life. Right. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4909.38s)]
*  You have to farm. Your daughter is seeing someone. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4912.18s)]
*  They're not engaging in like that. No, I'm sorry. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4916.7s)]
*  She's 23. Right. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4924.0199999999995s)]
*  But that young gentleman, he had to farm the relationship with Madison. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4925.7s)]
*  Right. He had to farm. It wasn't a transaction or a hunting relationship. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4930.42s)]
*  It doesn't work like that. He had to be intentional. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4933.18s)]
*  Farm, plant seeds, whatever those seeds are. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4935.18s)]
*  Check up on it. Know her birthday, know her dad's birthday, so on and so forth. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4937.54s)]
*  So farming and hunting are two different ways of building a relationship. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4940.54s)]
*  I look at college courses as sometimes outdated. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4944.02s)]
*  Yes. Right. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4946.860000000001s)]
*  And that bothers me a lot, especially with my kids, you know, going to college, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4948.34s)]
*  because a lot of things that they want to learn or that they're into. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4951.54s)]
*  A lot of times these colleges don't necessarily teach. Right. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4954.22s)]
*  My first major was communications. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4957.7s)]
*  I left communications and went to business management and marketing. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4958.9800000000005s)]
*  But for me, what I wanted to learn for communications [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4961.5s)]
*  wasn't helping me with what I wanted to do. Right. Right. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4964.74s)]
*  Communications was a lot of reading, a lot of intro, a lot of this, a lot of that. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4968.74s)]
*  But I wanted to be hands on with this stuff like that. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4971.5s)]
*  So talk about some of the courses that you think should be in college [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4974.62s)]
*  and some of the things that should be taken out of college. Right. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4977.42s)]
*  That's a that's great. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4980.38s)]
*  No disrespect. A lot of the algorithms I learned in college, I don't use. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4982.22s)]
*  I've never used. And if I have to, I have a computer that will do it for me. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4985.54s)]
*  Absolutely. Now, it's two parts I'm going to get into. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4988.82s)]
*  Now, some of the courses that are in college, I have to be really careful [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4991.5s)]
*  because I'm still a college professor and I don't want the college [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4994.14s)]
*  to be listening right now. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4997.7s)]
*  So I do believe there should be more entrepreneur courses in college. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=4998.78s)]
*  We're going to need AI courses in college. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5005.0599999999995s)]
*  We're going to need real estate courses in college. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5008.0199999999995s)]
*  You're going to need these things in colleges. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5010.9s)]
*  Now, I believe certain colleges are doing it. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5012.38s)]
*  Jaru's son. Shout out to Geordi. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5015.42s)]
*  He just graduated from SCAD in Atlanta. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5017.74s)]
*  Savannah. Savannah. Yeah, I'm sorry, Savannah. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5021.66s)]
*  And he was home for his sister's wedding. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5024.0199999999995s)]
*  And we were in the kitchen at Jaru's house. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5027.02s)]
*  And he was saying how all these different courses that he's taken at SCAD, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5029.06s)]
*  that was never available to me as a student. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5032.34s)]
*  So some of the courses that we're talking about, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5035.18s)]
*  like we've been removed from college for a little bit. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5037.14s)]
*  Some of these colleges are doing that, like teaching him how to code. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5039.620000000001s)]
*  He can build games. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5042.860000000001s)]
*  He can do all the things that I would never even thought of. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5043.740000000001s)]
*  I know because my daughter has been talking about it. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5046.26s)]
*  She's like, that's the way school should look at it. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5048.620000000001s)]
*  But like even when Jaru talks, he's like, listen, I've been to the campus. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5050.5s)]
*  And I'm like, I've never seen a school like this. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5053.18s)]
*  So, yeah, I do think we need those particular courses. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5056.139999999999s)]
*  Now, let me just rewind as far as like a communication course. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5059.42s)]
*  I mentioned in the book, I credit Eddie Murphy [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5062.54s)]
*  to where to one of the reasons I'm here today in the movie Boomerang. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5066.099999999999s)]
*  Like Boomerang is one of my favorite movies you've seen. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5070.379999999999s)]
*  Like he was a marketing executive. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5072.42s)]
*  He garnered so much attention from women. He was smart. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5074.98s)]
*  He was he was everything. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5077.139999999999s)]
*  I'm watching this and this goes back to my representation. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5078.379999999999s)]
*  I'm watching this movie. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5080.66s)]
*  I'm like, I want to I want to do that. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5082.139999999999s)]
*  I want to know how to do that. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5084.94s)]
*  So I was in college at the time. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5086.42s)]
*  So I went to my my counselor. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5087.58s)]
*  I said, listen, in this movie, this guy, Eddie Murphy, play Marcus Grant. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5090.06s)]
*  He's a marketing executive. How do I get into marketing? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5094.62s)]
*  She said, well, you need to understand what communication is [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5097.9s)]
*  to understand the market in this. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5100.38s)]
*  I said, well, sign me up for all communication courses. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5101.54s)]
*  X amount of years later, I'm doing marketing strategies for my own company. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5103.74s)]
*  So I needed that course. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5108.14s)]
*  I needed these courses to be able to do what I'm doing now. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5110.38s)]
*  Well, tell him where they could get this book, brother. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5114.78s)]
*  You can get the book on Amazon. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5116.86s)]
*  If you're listening, you can just type in Harold Wilkerson. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5120.0199999999995s)]
*  If you type in Harry, nothing's going to come up. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5123.3s)]
*  I don't come up. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5126.66s)]
*  It'd be a bunch of you. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5127.7s)]
*  But you was homies from Devereux. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5129.38s)]
*  Right. And people always make that mistake, too. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5130.82s)]
*  But that's a different story. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5132.7s)]
*  Yeah. But you can get the book on Amazon in a search engine. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5134.34s)]

*  And one of the lessons I want you to understand and learn, I believe it off. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5143.46s)]
*  I closed deals with the WNBA and I closed deals with the NBA [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5147.62s)]
*  from going over six, six or seven seasons now. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5151.22s)]
*  And it all started for me attending one basketball game. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5154.780000000001s)]
*  I attended a game and it went from the person who handed me my ticket [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5157.900000000001s)]
*  to go sit on the floor and through strategic and intentional communication. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5162.5s)]
*  I started closing deals with the CEO of the New York Liberty, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5168.06s)]
*  the CEO of the Brooklyn Nets. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5170.9s)]
*  Like it went from attending. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5173.219999999999s)]
*  How do you attend a game? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5174.46s)]
*  And then fast forward, you close in deals with the owners [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5176.5s)]
*  and CEOs of WNBA and NBA. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5181.0599999999995s)]
*  And you hear all that if you pick up the book. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5183.98s)]

*  All right, y'all. So in wrapping up our BET Awards talk, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5228.0199999999995s)]
*  we do got to talk about the fact that, Jess, you mentioned [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5230.62s)]
*  you would love to have seen Kaisenai and Druski a bit more [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5232.98s)]
*  in the BET Awards involved, right? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5235.98s)]
*  I was walking into the radio show this morning here in LA [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5238.66s)]
*  with someone who said to me, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5241.98s)]
*  the only reason that he even knew about the awards [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5243.38s)]
*  or how he watched the awards last night [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5245.66s)]
*  was because of Kaisenai's stream. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5247.46s)]
*  The stream went viral yesterday for a few moments. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5249.46s)]
*  The biggest moment was one of the big moments [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5252.0599999999995s)]

*  Let's take a listen to the original interaction [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5256.46s)]

*  That's what I'm talking about. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5266.82s)]
*  Come back to the court. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5267.82s)]
*  All right, gang. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5268.82s)]
*  Wale. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5270.82s)]
*  Oh my God, that was somebody crazy. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5271.82s)]
*  Hey, the whole chat knows him. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5273.42s)]
*  Wale. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5274.9800000000005s)]
*  Wale? What he do? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5275.9800000000005s)]
*  Rap. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5276.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, word? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5277.9800000000005s)]
*  You know this, like, load this flower barn [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5278.9800000000005s)]
*  and you're going outside? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5282.38s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5283.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5284.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5285.38s)]
*  Yeah, so because Kai didn't know who Wale was, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5286.38s)]
*  that clip started to go insanely viral. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5291.66s)]
*  So now Kai is in the awards. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5295.18s)]
*  He's sitting there. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5298.06s)]
*  I mean, they're running with it, but we'll talk later. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5299.06s)]
*  Wale, my guy, but that situation not that serious. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5302.06s)]
*  Yeah, I really just hope he playing. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5304.46s)]
*  You got to think, Kai's tonight is 23, Wale is 40. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5306.46s)]
*  He probably does not know Wale's music. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5310.54s)]
*  You know that? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5312.7s)]
*  But even if he doesn't know, you know, the chat told him [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5313.7s)]
*  and it ain't like he said anything crazy. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5316.1s)]
*  No, he just said, oh, that's somebody. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5318.1s)]
*  Oh, that's son? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5320.1s)]
*  Oh, word. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5321.1s)]
*  Cool. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5322.1s)]
*  And he may have checked him out after that, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5323.1s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5324.1s)]
*  But I would be happy that the chat even knew who I was. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5325.1s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5326.78s)]
*  You know, your chat schooled you on who I was. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5327.78s)]
*  I wouldn't have came back and said anything. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5329.82s)]
*  And age, you know, I guess plays a factor, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5332.06s)]
*  but we do realize when it comes to art, celebrity, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5334.7s)]
*  regardless of how big something may seem in your world, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5338.54s)]
*  everything is niche. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5342.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5343.9800000000005s)]
*  If you think everyone in the world knows everybody, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5344.9800000000005s)]
*  then you're bugging. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5347.62s)]
*  And guess what? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5348.780000000001s)]

*  who have tens of millions of followers [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5351.26s)]

*  So the internet really made this much ado about nothing. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5355.1s)]
*  But like Kai wasn't disrespectful. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5357.9400000000005s)]
*  He just said the wrong name, his name was like, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5359.58s)]

*  When you meet someone that you've never met before, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5376.62s)]
*  introduce yourself. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5379.54s)]
*  I've seen Beyonce walk in the room [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5380.54s)]

*  don't mean that they know you. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5390.219999999999s)]

*  where he was talking to Kevin Hart and Drew Ski [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5427.86s)]
*  about their involvement and even how they got involved [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5428.86s)]

*  I knew he said, I said I'm not hosting. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5437.86s)]
*  We would not be able to log in this. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5438.86s)]
*  I said I'm not hosting if Kai cannot come back and stream. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5439.86s)]

*  Yeah, I'll tell you one thing too. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5454.86s)]
*  All you award shows are bugging if you don't pay Kai's to not, you know, six figures, high [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5465.86s)]
*  six figures to live stream your award show from backstage. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5471.78s)]
*  Like whatever money y'all spending on promotion and marketing for a bunch of stuff, people [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5475.139999999999s)]
*  don't see you better spin with that demographic. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5479.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5481.7s)]
*  You better give Kai, you know, high six figures. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5482.7s)]
*  Do it beforehand and during the show, like you said, so you can promote it. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5486.22s)]
*  Like he said, that kid said he didn't know anything about the BET Awards until he seen [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5489.38s)]
*  them on Cosmic. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5492.78s)]
*  I thought that was crazy. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5493.78s)]
*  He was like, you here for the awards? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5494.78s)]
*  They came on, they came on. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5495.78s)]
*  I was like, it was everywhere yesterday. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5496.78s)]
*  Why did you think that was crazy? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5498.18s)]
*  Think about all these award shows that we didn't know the air, I didn't know the air [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5499.18s)]
*  maids was on the other night. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5501.78s)]
*  They should have had it. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5502.78s)]
*  I should have not. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5503.78s)]
*  What else? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5504.78s)]
*  What else? [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5505.78s)]
*  There was another award show. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5506.78s)]
*  I was like, I didn't even know that was on. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5507.78s)]
*  I think that was the AMAs. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5509.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was the AMAs. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5510.179999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5511.179999999999s)]
*  I think I saw that because it was Kai screaming. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5512.179999999999s)]
*  JLo opened up with, yes, that was AMAs, American Music Awards. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5515.179999999999s)]
*  I think I saw that because of Kai. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5518.74s)]
*  Kai was streaming that one as well. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5520.38s)]
*  So yes, you should be paying Kai to not high six figures to scream from backstage and during [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5521.86s)]
*  the award show. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5525.86s)]
*  I agree. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5526.86s)]
*  As we wrap up, I know we've been talking a lot about black music and culture. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5527.86s)]
*  I do want to say rest in peace to Sly Stone of the Sly and the Family Stone Band. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5530.98s)]

*  I want to take you higher. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5557.700000000001s)]
*  His family released a statement and said that he passed away peacefully surrounded by his [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5558.7s)]
*  three children, his closest friends and extended family. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5571.86s)]

*  I saw one rest in peace. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdEpA2LpSw&t=5580.54s)]
