*  I thought it was over. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=39.04s)]
*  No, this is the last thing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=40.04s)]
*  This is like a showcase. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=41.4s)]
*  So it's the rehearsal. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=42.4s)]
*  So I had to rehearse, right? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=43.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=45.24s)]

*  Boom, right? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=47.44s)]

*  Yeah, just the one move, right? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=50.44s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=51.44s)]
*  You got to do a lot of stuff. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=52.44s)]
*  But that one move was hurting. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=53.44s)]
*  Damn. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=54.44s)]

*  One guy who ran from the other corner. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=201.56s)]
*  He probably was a cop. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=203.56s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=204.56s)]
*  Did you pull over to try to help? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=205.56s)]
*  No. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=206.56s)]
*  I saw him running over. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=207.56s)]
*  See. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=208.56s)]
*  Then the light turned green. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=209.56s)]
*  I was like ah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=210.56s)]
*  He ran over. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=211.56s)]
*  He helped her. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=212.56s)]
*  We just got to be better as people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=213.56s)]
*  That was sad. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=214.56s)]
*  We were trying to get to the game yesterday. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=215.56s)]
*  Where you said it was at? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=216.56s)]
*  5th Avenue. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=217.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=218.56s)]
*  They were trying to get to the game. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=219.56s)]
*  They were trying to get to the garden. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=220.56s)]
*  That is so trash. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=221.56s)]
*  They got beat to traffic. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=222.56s)]
*  I'm with you though. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=223.56s)]
*  I do agree. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=224.56s)]
*  Certain things. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=225.56s)]
*  You see kids in danger. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=226.56s)]
*  Elderly people. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=227.56s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=228.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=229.96s)]
*  People just want to mind their business. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=230.96s)]
*  They don't want no issue. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=231.96s)]
*  No problem. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=232.96s)]
*  You don't know what's happening. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=233.96s)]
*  A lot of people just want to mind their business. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=234.96s)]
*  You're right. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=235.96s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=236.96s)]
*  Let me salute to my mom's too. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=237.96s)]
*  She turns 80 on Sunday. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=238.96s)]
*  Mom Dukes turns 80. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=239.96s)]
*  Drop a bomb for Mom Dukes. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=240.96s)]
*  That's a blessing. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=241.96s)]

*  We are the Breakfast Club. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=259.86s)]
*  Let's get in some front page news. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=260.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=262.56s)]
*  Last night New York Knicks took on the Indiana Pacers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=264.52s)]
*  They won 111-94. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=266.56s)]
*  So now the series, they're still down. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Indiana leads the series 3-2. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=271.56s)]
*  Next game is Saturday at 8 p.m. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=273.16s)]
*  Did you guys watch the game? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=274.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=275.8s)]
*  It was a good game. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=276.8s)]
*  I mean I thought the Knicks would win game five. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=277.8s)]
*  Oh so that caller that called up and told you like they don't come to work tomorrow. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=280.8s)]
*  I was coming regardless. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=285.8s)]
*  We shut Halliburton down. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=286.8s)]
*  I think Halliburton had six or eight points right. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=287.8s)]
*  He didn't score much so we shut him down. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=290.48s)]
*  So congratulations then NV. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=292.48s)]

*  What's up Morgan? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=303.48s)]
*  I know that's right. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=304.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=305.48s)]
*  Let's get into it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=306.48s)]
*  First on front page. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=307.48s)]
*  Good luck trying to keep up with the tariffs. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=308.48s)]
*  One minute they're in place. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=311.48s)]
*  The next minute they're being blocked by a federal court. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=313.12s)]
*  That was the case yesterday after a federal appeals court reinstated President Trump's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=315.68s)]
*  tariff plan and then a second court, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=319.0s)]
*  emergency law does not give Trump an authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=324.12s)]
*  Now a U.S. district judge upheld the ruling after the Justice Department appealed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=329.68s)]
*  Now the DOJ said it will go all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=334.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, the White House claims President Trump's tariff plan is legally sound. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=338.08s)]
*  Now, Press Secretary Caroline Levitt called the ruling another example of judicial overreach, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=342.32s)]
*  adding that Trump had every right to impose those tariffs. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=347.88s)]
*  Let's take a listen to White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt on those comments. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=351.08s)]
*  Three judges of the U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed and brazenly abused their [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=355.8s)]
*  judicial power to usurp the authority of President Trump to stop him from carrying out the mandate [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=360.52s)]
*  that the American people gave him. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=365.86s)]
*  Underlying his full and proper legal authority, President Trump imposed universal tariffs [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=367.6s)]
*  and reciprocal tariffs on Liberation Day to address the extraordinary threat to our national [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=372.72s)]
*  security and economy. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=378.32000000000005s)]
*  Well, we all know that Congress holds the purse, so who really needs to, you know, approve [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=380.36s)]
*  those tariffs in a sense? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=386.8s)]
*  Well, Levitt went on to say the U.S. has been abused when it comes to trade. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=388.12s)]
*  The administration has requested an emergency stay on other pending appeal and the series [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=391.92s)]
*  of tariffs announcements dating back to February have, of course, shaken up the financial markets. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=397.96s)]
*  You've seen them. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  They're up, they're down. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, all of this because of tariffs and trade. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  I love when the courts do things like this because, you know, I want to know and believe [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  that there are still checks and balances. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=411.88s)]
*  Okay, we are a republic, not a monarchy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=413.52s)]
*  We'll get into it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=416.35999999999996s)]
*  In other news, multiple Doge officials are reportedly leaving the Trump administration. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=417.44s)]
*  Among those leaving the Doge is top attorney James Burnham, a longtime Elon Musk counterpart, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=422.28s)]
*  Steve Davis. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=429.08s)]
*  Both are in the process of offboarding from their roles as special government employees. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=430.08s)]
*  They are also limited, just like the Elon Musk, to the 130 days of service. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  Now the White House says that Doge's mission will continue to cut waste, fraud, and abuse [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  from government spending and will continue to, and it will continue following Elon Musk's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=444.4s)]
*  departure. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=449.4s)]
*  The Secretary, Caroline Levitt, said many of Doge employees are now political appointees [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=450.52s)]
*  and government employees and intend to stay. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  Let's hear those comments from Levitt again. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=458.12s)]
*  The entire cabinet understands the need to cut government waste, fraud, and abuse, and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=460.67999999999995s)]
*  each cabinet secretary at their respective agencies is committed to that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=464.76s)]
*  That's why they were working hand in hand with Elon Musk, and they'll continue to work [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=468.12s)]
*  with the respective Doge employees who have onboarded as political appointees. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=471.4s)]
*  Elon Musk began offboarding as a government employee on Wednesday. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=477.12s)]
*  He of course helped lead the Department of Government Efficiency since it was established [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=481.12s)]
*  in January as a special government employee. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=486.2s)]
*  Musk was allowed also to work for the administration for the 130 day calendar year. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=489.4s)]
*  This is also ahead of this CBS interview that he has previewed saying that he believes that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  the big beautiful bill that Trump is pushing undermines the work of Doge and the work that [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=502.96s)]
*  he's doing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=510.96s)]
*  He says the bill can be big, it can be beautiful, but he's not sure that it can be both. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=511.96s)]
*  So we'll keep you posted on those comments coming from Musk from that interview on Sunday [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=516.12s)]
*  on CBS. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  And seven, front page news continues and we'll talk about what's happening with Harvard [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=522.1999999999999s)]
*  and China and a lot more. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=528.0799999999999s)]
*  So you guys stick around. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=530.4399999999999s)]

*  Direct testimony of a woman who was testifying by the name of Mia now this woman is me [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1026.74s)]
*  Oh, do we know who she is what she looks like? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1032.06s)]

*  So I could have looked that up [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1039.58s)]
*  But because of how like they wouldn't even allow you to sketch her on a notepad in the court [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1040.7s)]
*  So you didn't so you can see her no I could see her but I don't want to be the person that puts her [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1045.34s)]

*  Mia was a former personal assistant of Diddy and she also was one of the [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1055.94s)]
*  Leads of revolt films so she would bring in films for him and do different TV projects and all that [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1060.74s)]
*  She like a white. I'm just curious she from what I could see she was white [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1065.12s)]
*  Okay, but I don't know if there's anything else mixed up in there [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1068.62s)]
*  But she alleged that Diddy raped her several times [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1071.22s)]
*  She says she actually went through about I would say two or three different [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1075.08s)]
*  alleged like [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1080.7s)]
*  sexual [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1082.7s)]
*  Incidents but she said that there was a ton more and [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1085.3s)]
*  She alleges that she can't remember all of them because it was long ago, but also it was very traumatic [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1088.74s)]
*  But she says that basically the first one happened [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1094.3s)]
*  She led the first one happened because she used to stay in his houses a lot because her her life was his life [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1097.72s)]
*  It was very demanding. She was in one of his houses and she alleged that Diddy came in [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1102.74s)]
*  Got into a lower bunk bed with her that she was staying in and forced himself allegedly in her and then that happened a couple [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1106.34s)]
*  More times it was one time she alleges when she was like packing clothing for him in a closet of his [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1113.34s)]
*  and in another time [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1118.5s)]
*  When she was on a private jet allegedly when they were traveling and she went to the bathroom [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1120.06s)]
*  Which was in like a back area where he stayed and she alleges that he forced himself into the bathroom [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1124.58s)]
*  But she couldn't remember the details of inside of the bathroom [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1129.94s)]
*  Do and do we know why she's the only one that's anonymous how because why haven't they given her names everybody else names? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1132.98s)]
*  They given everybody else's face. They allowed how come she's not [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1138.38s)]
*  People I do not know. I don't know that but I do know that [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1142.3s)]
*  The the whole like testifying under a pseudonym thing. I've never seen it in real life, but it's so serious [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1146.74s)]
*  I mean like they brought up like her passport just to verify her identity within like the two legal teams and the jurors and like [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1151.98s)]
*  They took at least 30 minutes making sure no cameras people didn't have phone because some attorneys are allowed at phones [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1158.98s)]
*  Making sure if I had their phones off like security got tight even in overflow rooms. It was like a thing [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1163.86s)]
*  I don't know what the difference is though [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1168.58s)]
*  But you felt the difference though with the protection of her and some of the other witnesses in my opinion [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1170.26s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not for sure but she also [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1174.26s)]
*  Is she think she's somebody daughter like real big? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1176.26s)]
*  I'm not for sure. I mean she she she talked about you know [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1179.26s)]
*  Just being a normal person with a dream at like her early 20s trying to work in entertainment [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1182.98s)]
*  And she got this job with Diddy and she had no idea but she was being severely like overworked [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1188.26s)]
*  And she was going allegedly she was going through things that weren't normal like she alleges that she got her arm slammed in a door [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1194.14s)]
*  One time because [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1200.86s)]
*  She was very close to Cassie because she allegedly would be the person that Diddy was sent to go take care of Cassie when things would [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1202.86s)]
*  Happen and you know, she's seen some of the physical abuse, but there was one time I guess where Diddy [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1207.3s)]
*  Grabbed her phone allegedly and they were having conversations back and forth [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1212.4599999999998s)]
*  But then she also had conversations with some of the other staff who would make jokes about Diddy's moods and temperament and she was nervous [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1216.3s)]
*  She didn't want him to see it [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1221.82s)]
*  So she ran after him with the phone and he allegedly slammed the door and she thought it was a mistake [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1222.62s)]
*  And then he allegedly did it again [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1226.82s)]
*  She also says that she was pushed into a pool allegedly at one point. She's had things thrown at her [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1228.86s)]
*  It's a ton of different things. She's seen a lot [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1234.02s)]
*  She was able to have more conversation about some of the alleged Cassie beatings that we had her Cassie talk about [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1237.9399999999998s)]
*  From her point of view. She also alleged that she was one of the assistants that would have to go set up the hotel nights [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1243.78s)]
*  And all the assistants in their hotel nights recaps are [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1249.4199999999998s)]
*  Spot-on the same what they had a she must have been a little bit of a [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1252.7s)]
*  Spot-on the same what they had a she must she must couldn't swim if she's you know [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1256.2800000000002s)]
*  She says she got pushed in the pool. She must really just couldn't swim because that can be detrimental [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  I especially your boss allegedly is doing it and you can't swim. Yeah, that's your question Lauren. You've been in the courtroom [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1265.88s)]
*  Yes, do you feel like the government can take a nap anytime soon? Oh the government could have went to sleep yesterday [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1271.96s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like the government can sleep very comfortably at this point. Yeah, it feels like they could rest this case [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1276.8400000000001s)]
*  How it's been three weeks? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1282.5800000000002s)]
*  This is week now right three [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1285.22s)]
*  Yeah, but including but then there was a whole week of the jury selection to which I know doesn't count [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1288.1799999999998s)]
*  But yes [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1292.3s)]
*  I do think that that could happen right now and honestly at the end of court yesterday there was a conversation about because the government had [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1293.1599999999999s)]
*  already said that they're probably going to be rusting their case a bit early and [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1298.34s)]
*  Diddy's team came yesterday and made it clear like even though the government can't find whatever witnesses they're trying to find or they feel [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1301.98s)]
*  Like they're rusting their case early. We are not going to do that [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1308.34s)]
*  We still have you know, legally we have the right to respond to some of these things and we plan to do so [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1310.66s)]
*  So they said they want to go to the full period to July 4th [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1315.3s)]
*  Yeah, I mean if to me if you've been paying attention to the court of law and not the court of public opinion social media [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1318.2s)]
*  I haven't heard the defense make a case for Diddy's innocence at all. I haven't heard the defense make a case [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1323.24s)]
*  Period like the prosecution has been the power top and Diddy's defense is the helpless bottom in this situation. It seems like [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1328.78s)]
*  You love topping bottoms and then I get attacked when I throw you in in that community [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1335.5s)]
*  That the bottoms don't like you. They said I'm not one of them. They shouldn't like they said they see me [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1339.4s)]
*  They said you not clean [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1346.1200000000001s)]
*  Said you don't be cleaning right? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1352.76s)]
*  You tell us [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1356.52s)]
*  Yes, I do think that the prosecution could rest at this point yesterday I was in a court and I was like [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1359.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know why we have to still be here [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1363.8000000000002s)]
*  I do think in the beginning Diddy's team was doing really really good at poking holes in different stories and you know open it [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1365.56s)]
*  I in the beginning like the first week of testimonies [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1372.6799999999998s)]
*  I think that they did a good job of like making you think about things [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1375.12s)]
*  But you know what I believe what I know happened the more that the prosecutors brought on different guests [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1378.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean guests different witnesses and they painted different pictures and added different sides of stories. That's where it got tough [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1383.32s)]
*  I feel like Cassie laid a proper foundation and then you bought in her mom and you bought in kid Cuddy [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1389.56s)]
*  You bought in Capricorn Clark. I feel like at least two predicates in the in the Rico charge were proven just in those [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1395.32s)]
*  So alone so let's break it down just just quickly so the racketeering conspiracy, right? [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1403.6s)]
*  They alleged that combs uses business empire and employees to engage in a pattern of illegal activity [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1408.04s)]
*  Sex trafficking forced label and offenses. We see that yes, and Mia put a bow on that yesterday [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1413.52s)]
*  She talked about everybody from HR allegedly being involved in the cover-ups sex trafficking by force fraud or coercion. Have we seen that? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1418.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, that's what they've been painting this whole time with Cassie allegedly is like she's forced [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1425.4399999999998s)]
*  She doesn't want to be there and she's so scared because of the physical abuse that she receives that she doesn't have a choice [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1430.12s)]
*  But but that's not what the sexual workers so it's a little different, right? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1435.36s)]
*  But it but they're three different charges though. That's he got the Rico and then you got the sex traffic [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1438.72s)]
*  Transportation to engage in prostitution. We seen that one. Oh, he definitely was smuggling booty cross day [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1443.2s)]
*  There was one escort that testified that he traveled to different places [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1447.9399999999998s)]
*  That booty was traveling a booty smuggler [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  Booty smuggling is so so so from what you're saying, we've seen at least two or three of those. Yes [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1455.0s)]
*  Happening I'm listening none of us are attorneys right nor and we're not attorneys and nor are we jurors and [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1460.88s)]
*  I think the biggest thing and the hardest thing for the jurors is gonna be [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1466.14s)]
*  Not leaning too much on emotion and stick into fact and it's gonna be tough for them because I'm in there every day and I [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1469.68s)]
*  Feel like emotionally I'm on yesterday. I couldn't even talk about it because I didn't know how I felt [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1475.16s)]
*  Emotionally, but factually I was like man. I think that this case is over [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1479.72s)]
*  Yeah, so I think you still got the celebrity of [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1482.72s)]
*  Diddy, oh my god, which will play a role yesterday [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1486.08s)]
*  There was a whole free Diddy train a car protest outside is insane at the courthouse now. Yes [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1489.06s)]

*  The White House is arguing a Boston federal judge overreached when ruling to block a plan to in Harvard's ability to enroll [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1592.26s)]
*  Foreign students now a federal judge said she planned to issue a preliminary injunction against the administration's effort [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1600.02s)]
*  She said she wants to maintain status quo by allowing the Ivy League school to continue hosting international students on visas [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1606.3s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt said Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoke student visas and the president is acting within his elite his [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1613.5800000000002s)]
*  Legal authority let's hear more from White House Press Secretary Levitt Secretary of State Rubio has simply [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1622.14s)]
*  Used his authority to revoke those visas to revoke that privilege [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1628.5800000000002s)]
*  And we've seen the courts try to block that these judges want to be the Secretary of State or they want to be the president [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1632.38s)]
*  They can run for office themselves. It should be the other way around but all of the actions the president has taken [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1637.8600000000001s)]
*  Rely on legal authorities that have already been granted to him by our nation's existing laws [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1643.26s)]
*  Why does the White House always say a judge is overreaching whenever it's a court that's blocking one of their plans? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1647.66s)]
*  I [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1652.8200000000002s)]
*  Don't like it, you know anything that's anything that's a speed hump [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1654.02s)]
*  Opposition a challenge to the White House or this administration. They are not feeling but once again checks and balances [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1658.1000000000001s)]
*  That's what we need and if what they're doing is actually the right thing to do then they'll be able to get through the check [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1664.22s)]
*  They'll be able to get to the checkpoint if what they're doing is not the right thing to do then it needs to be blocked [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1670.98s)]
*  Block it so that's ruling of course comes the same day as Harvard held its graduation ceremony [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1676.98s)]
*  So congratulations to those graduates class to 2025, you know, if I'm sure it was quite the challenge. Yeah, man [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1683.02s)]

*  May is mental health awareness month and with the month coming to an end [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1695.5s)]
*  Of course the fight continues for those who are impacted. I believe this, you know touches you Charlemagne [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1699.46s)]
*  You know research shows that only 25% of black Americans will seek mental health treatment compared to 40% of white people [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1706.06s)]
*  access to quality health care and awareness have been said to play a role in that and of course I spoke with [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1713.66s)]
*  Dr. Sean Lewis who is a licensed professional counselor certified professional counselor supervisor and a co-owner of case support services based in Atlanta, Georgia [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1719.98s)]
*  And he had this to say about mental health and coping take a listen [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1729.62s)]
*  Go with the preference if your preference is you want African-american? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1734.58s)]
*  Therapists go with that. Definitely try try to process give it some type of thought and work with it. That's that's my thing [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1739.58s)]
*  I we have to change our mindsets. We can't think like back in the day because I know my mother was born in 60 [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1746.3799999999999s)]
*  She's a therapy. I really I'm not crazy about therapy [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=1752.06s)]

*  Well, it's the latest on the breakfast club talk to me [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3463.3s)]
*  Well first before we get into our next story, we talked about the uh the betting the diddy bets [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3467.06s)]
*  So bet us does have some bets on here so [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3471.78s)]
*  I told y'all. Yeah, they asked a couple questions. So they asked uh the people how long will shawn diddy combs trial last? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3475.6200000000003s)]
*  Uh, and most people think that it will go over eight weeks [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3483.0600000000004s)]
*  Well, shawn diddy comes i don't think so now i'm thinking shawn diddy comes we found guilty of sex trafficking. Most people say yes [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3486.6600000000003s)]
*  Uh, will shawn diddy comes we found guilty of all charges [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3492.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes is uh plus 500 right? So that means that [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3496.5800000000004s)]
*  I think i'll get you all more likely correct [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3499.38s)]
*  It means you have to bet 100 to win 500. Oh, you got better [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3502.82s)]
*  Don't know what that means. Um [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3507.38s)]
*  And then they asked the question we were talking about how many years will diddy serve for the charges of sex trafficking [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3509.46s)]
*  Racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution all together. He won't serve any years. It's plus 2000 [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3514.08s)]
*  Uh, that means that it's very very unlikely [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3520.98s)]
*  Uh from one to five years plus 2500 people really think that diddy is going to be looking at 11 to 15 years [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3523.78s)]
*  And one of the greatest songs ever written was ti and usher my life your entertainment [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3531.7000000000003s)]
*  But that's really the era that we that's crazy. You could bet on somebody's life like that. Wow my god [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3535.62s)]
*  Yeah, that is uh, according to bet us.com [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3541.62s)]
*  Which is like a sports book, but yes, um moving on. Thank you for that lauren. Thank you. Appreciate it. Just thank you for wanting it [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3544.82s)]
*  I'm moving [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3552.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay, lauren took a shot and started freestyling I walked in [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3562.8199999999997s)]
*  I was recording my diddy recap video because I told y'all yesterday. Why was you rapping? I wasn't rapping, you know [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3570.58s)]
*  Focus lauren focus [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3582.5s)]
*  Happy birthday remi, okay speaking of rappers cardi b off set [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3587.7s)]
*  So tmz exclusively broke a story that offset is asking for spousal support in his divorce from cardi b [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3591.62s)]
*  Uh, so they say that the rapper filed an amended divorce response earlier this month and he is now asking that cardi b pay him [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3598.02s)]
*  Spousal support he does not request a specific amount in the documents. Um, the rest of the other requests look relatively unchanged [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3603.54s)]
*  Offset is still asking for joint custody of the children and he wants cardi's place to serve as a primary residence for the kids [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3612.18s)]
*  um now [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3618.98s)]
*  When these reports came out, you know, I like to reach out and figure out what is going on [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3620.8199999999997s)]
*  So we I reached out to both sides. We heard back from offset's team offset team says that he does not need the money [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3624.18s)]
*  That this was filed because he alleges that cardi b was trying to come at him [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3631.7799999999997s)]
*  On things that were not fair. He alleges that she wants to decide [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3636.58s)]
*  Uh when he can see the kids he also alleges that [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3640.66s)]
*  Uh cardi b is asking for everything like the properties and the cars [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3643.86s)]
*  So his attorneys did this and he also alleges and this is a big allegation. He also alleges that [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3648.02s)]
*  Uh, he did this because cardi b is barely ever with their kids [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3653.38s)]
*  Okay, yeah [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3659.78s)]
*  So that's playing out in court and i'm sure there'll be an update. I wonder I mean [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3661.94s)]
*  I don't if it's available, I guess you should pursue it, but I don't understand why men need spousal support [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3665.62s)]
*  Because what are you using the money for if unless if you had if the man had primary custody of the kids then I would [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3671.7799999999997s)]
*  Understand but then in that case it would just be child support, but I don't understand. What what do you need spousal support? [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3677.9199999999996s)]
*  So you don't think a man is ever [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3683.7s)]
*  supposed to be [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3686.8999999999996s)]
*  Paid like he's ever supposed to be because think about it if i'm the mother i'm supposed to receive spousal support [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3688.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm paying you and then you're probably just going to take that money and use it on yourself and then use it on the kids [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3692.82s)]
*  So why not let the wife keep that money for the kids? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3697.78s)]
*  I think it depends if child support is spousal support, but I'm saying what do you need it? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3700.34s)]
*  What is it? What do you need it for the man unless you broke for instance, right? Let's say [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3704.02s)]
*  I'm i'm marrying somebody that makes way more than me, right? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3708.42s)]
*  And I give up my career to take care of home and to travel with that person [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3710.98s)]
*  If we break up I gave up my career for her career that I understand [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3715.2200000000003s)]
*  In that case, yes, that's answering the question because i'm like what do you need spousal support as a man for unless you're broke? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3719.54s)]
*  Unless that's unless your only means of income was her [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3725.2200000000003s)]
*  But but okay an offset case that that's not the case case by case [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3729.06s)]
*  Yeah [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3734.1800000000003s)]
*  Because it's basically to ensure like you said envy a financial dependent spouse receives just a reasonable financial support after the divorce legal separation [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3734.42s)]
*  But he his team is saying he don't need the money [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3741.2200000000003s)]
*  He's doing this because he's trying to get his own method of how to control the situation [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3744.1800000000003s)]
*  So that's different in their case [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3747.7s)]
*  But in other people's cases, yeah, you got to keep up with some of y'all just be broke [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3749.06s)]
*  A lot of y'all men just be broke and the woman was making all the money [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3751.9399999999996s)]
*  So I completely understand why y'all want spousal support. I guess in the case like offset. That's what i'm asking [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3754.4199999999996s)]
*  Why would offset need spousal support? He makes his own money. I guess that's just a play in court [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3758.18s)]
*  But like he didn't need cardi to make money. No, no, it's just a play in court [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3761.7799999999997s)]
*  But you know, they both make money and like you said if the woman or the wife has the kids and they're [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3764.74s)]
*  Maintaining the kids every day is at the house. You're paying for food. You're paying for sky zone and everything [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3769.52s)]
*  Yeah, and I just want you to know that you're a man asking for spousal support [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3775.54s)]
*  We're gonna look at you and think you're broke. Okay, we're gonna look at you and think that you were just mooching off this woman [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3778.58s)]
*  Yeah, and whether the kids are with her all the time or not are they with you all the time? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3783.38s)]
*  That would be the question to see them with her all the time. Don't mean he not taking care of she can't have a nanny [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3788.1s)]
*  She can't you know, is that why he's trying to get joint custody though to make sure you know [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3792.82s)]
*  I mean, I think from what it sounds like he's saying that he doesn't feel like he gets equal access to the kids [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3797.14s)]
*  So he wants to be able to legally be able to set up schedules and you know all the other those things [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3802.26s)]
*  But but yeah, I mean i'm pretty sure this is going to play out on court because the teams are going to have to respond [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3806.34s)]
*  So we'll there'll be update here [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3810.6600000000003s)]
*  But it doesn't make sense though because most most the most of the men that i've known personally who have [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3811.94s)]
*  Seeked child spouse support couldn't make a dime without the woman [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3816.82s)]
*  Like their primary source of income was the woman, right? Yes, it's different in this case [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3821.38s)]
*  But okay moving on speaking of happy marriages in couples [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3825.6200000000003s)]
*  Uh eddie murphy has uh revealed that his son actually went and secretly married [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3829.3799999999997s)]
*  Martin lawrence's daughter in a private wedding. He revealed this on the jennifer hudson show [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3835.14s)]

*  Singing like walking daddy daughter dan singing I was tripping off the fact that she said y'all in-laws now [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3925.22s)]
*  Like if that was a revelation that nobody knew right nobody could understand [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3930.8199999999997s)]

*  Yeah, like you know to say act like you've been here before oh they've been there before because they've been rich a long time [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3943.14s)]
*  Yeah, um eric murphy and jasmine page, uh [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3948.18s)]
*  Are the two that got married and it was a big deal when martin began to talk about who was going to pay for the wedding [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3951.7000000000003s)]
*  It became such a spectacle as you would assume and I think people were just like oh my god [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3956.02s)]
*  How did they like that's so crazy that these two are together? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3960.02s)]
*  So I can understand them wanting their privacy because of their families and you know, how big this did become also in the public [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3962.9s)]
*  It became a thing between martin and eddie and who's gonna pay for the wedding [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3968.58s)]
*  That's not what that day is about that day is about me and this person [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3971.3s)]
*  You know coming together in holy matrimony [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3974.5s)]
*  And we should lift that in the bud the whole thing that the the father of the bride has to pay for the wedding [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3976.5s)]
*  That's just stop that's bs. I would say that too if I had six kids. I got four damn [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3980.5s)]

*  My father already told me he's not paying for me to marry a new mexican dude [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=3993.54s)]

*  And they just basically not paying you at all for the while that you're doing [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4510.5199999999995s)]

*  So I switched to the list and everything like that, but they just keep reducing the money that they're giving the drivers and increasing [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4520.36s)]

*  But i'm glad we could clear that up and then now we can move forward. There we go [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4720.200000000001s)]
*  Do you get that often? You know, not so much anymore. Okay. Yeah the the time of me being accused of that [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4724.68s)]
*  Has dissipated mostly but you know, hey listen, I appreciate the question [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4731.08s)]
*  I'm an open book and I hope after our time together you will see that for yourself, but thank you for asking [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4735.4s)]
*  What have you been up to that's what that was a question that people were asking it was like, you know [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4743.0s)]
*  Where where has tommy lauren been doing my thing, you know doing my thing on fox [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4746.12s)]
*  We've been through a couple elections since you and I last spoke [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4749.88s)]
*  Uh, this one went more my direction. I would say as the the last one did when we you know, we're talking [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4753.5599999999995s)]
*  Previously during trump edmund one and you and I talked about you know [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4760.360000000001s)]
*  If you would be open to seeing what the president had to offer and you know [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4763.96s)]
*  We've got a few years separating that and now and i'm personally i'm happy with with everything that's happening [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4768.360000000001s)]
*  So really honest, come on honest assessment now. I promise you this [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4773.88s)]
*  If there comes a time where this administration does something that I don't like [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4777.96s)]
*  I'm happy to say it and I don't know if you've seen over the years, but i've taken a beating [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4781.96s)]
*  For going against the right and I was fired for going against the right. Um, I think that was pre the blaze, right? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4787.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4794.5199999999995s)]
*  I have no problem doing that if I see an issue i'll say it I don't play for a team [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4796.28s)]
*  I don't work for the trump administration if they do something. I don't like i'm happy to say. All right, that's not my thing [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4800.68s)]
*  Right now i'm happy. We'll see [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4805.639999999999s)]
*  You know, we're we're a few months in well you were fired from the blaze after saying you support a woman's right to choose [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4807.639999999999s)]
*  Did that moment did you not realize in that moment that the movement that you promote doesn't really allow true freedom of thought [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4814.5199999999995s)]
*  Because that's what it feels like it doesn't feel like they allow true freedom of thought our freedom of speech [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4820.28s)]
*  Well, i'll tell you this that particular network didn't like it, but the network I'm at now definitely supports my right to free speech [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4823.4s)]
*  Yeah, there were a lot of people on the right that didn't like that. I said that i'm someone who really believes in freedom [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4830.68s)]
*  I don't like government intervention. So when I said I was pro-choice it was hey listen, i'm personally pro-life [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4834.92s)]
*  But I don't like the government telling people what to do in that regard and I don't think the government feels that neat [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4840.36s)]
*  I really don't um [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4845.24s)]
*  I think that's a place for family and faith and community to come in during that time. That's hard for women [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4846.52s)]
*  I don't think the government does it well [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4852.2s)]
*  So I don't think the government should impede and I was very forthright about that [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4853.4800000000005s)]
*  Some people didn't like that and that's okay, but I got eviscerated for that, you know [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4857.24s)]
*  And I had to go through a battle with a network for that. But that's why when I say I don't play for a team [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4862.12s)]
*  I don't play for a side. I'm happy to take the hits from my side if I believe in something i'm gonna say it [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4868.28s)]
*  So the left or the right? I mean i'm kind of a punching bag for both and that's okay with me [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4873.24s)]
*  Do you feel like a president should uphold the constitution? Oh, absolutely third duty [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4877.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so when you see him on meet the press and he's asked that question president trump [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4881.48s)]
*  He's asked that question and he says I don't know you can't be happy with that [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4885.0s)]
*  Well to be fair when he was asked that question it was regarding illegal immigration and what his administration's abilities are [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4888.599999999999s)]
*  Now that's gonna end up being decided by the supreme court. We don't have those decisions yet [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4896.36s)]
*  But to say he's just not upholding the constitution. He's saying well the lawyers are gonna tell me how far I can go [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4901.72s)]
*  So I respect him when he says that he's not saying nope. I know the answer. He's saying listen, this is gonna play out [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4907.88s)]
*  Judicially, it's gonna play out legislatively. It's gonna play out but i'm gonna do what I can [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4912.900000000001s)]
*  To you know protect the sovereignty of our nation and our borders and we had an invasion in his mind and in my mind [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4917.64s)]
*  And we have to correct that and the voters voted [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4924.28s)]
*  Largely to correct that so he when he said that about the constitution he wasn't saying [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4926.84s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. He was saying listen, it's gonna play out. There is actual due process language in the constitution [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4930.68s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4937.08s)]
*  To me, there's a gray area everybody is the right everybody does have the right to do process [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4937.88s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4941.08s)]
*  To me, there's a gray area there and it depends on what we're talking about [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4941.64s)]
*  So the position the president has and my position is this it's a privilege to be in our country [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4944.52s)]
*  And there were millions of people who came into our country and they said I don't want to follow a process to get in [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4950.4400000000005s)]
*  But now I want a different process in order for you to remove me [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4956.92s)]
*  And what this administration is saying and what many americans including myself feel is listen [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4961.24s)]
*  You need to follow our laws. You did not follow our immigration laws [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4966.92s)]
*  So there's going to be a different process for you than an american citizen [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4970.04s)]
*  And if two immigration courts say you're gang affiliated [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4974.28s)]
*  If you've beaten your wife and you have protective orders filed against you if you're accused of trafficking people around this country [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4978.52s)]
*  Which is a major issue human trafficking and sex trafficking [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4985.16s)]
*  Then you no longer have the privilege of being in this country. And by the way, you also came in illegally [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4988.360000000001s)]
*  So the whole due process conversation that's where I stack up on that now [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4993.0s)]
*  Listen, I don't believe people should just be rounded up with you know, just because they see you and they say get out of here [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=4996.6s)]
*  But if you came to this country legally you are up for deportation you came here illegally [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5002.759999999999s)]
*  Yes, but the constitution still says you're allowed due process now [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5007.799999999999s)]
*  I'm not even saying that I disagree with you know that stance. I'm just saying you still have to abide by what the constitution says [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5010.44s)]
*  But why did nobody take any issue during the obama administration when he deported three million people without that? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5018.2s)]
*  Due process of yes, you're in here illegally. Yes, the court says you're here illegally [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5024.44s)]
*  But we're going to deport you because you're in the country illegally [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5029.08s)]
*  There was no extra due process for those three million under obama and nobody had an issue with it [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5032.280000000001s)]
*  So now my question is why now is there another level of due process besides an immigration court saying you're here illegally [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5037.160000000001s)]
*  You have a notice to be deported. I've always asked that question [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5044.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's to my knowledge that those people that because obama deported more people more people than any president ever [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5047.400000000001s)]
*  But those people still were deported, you know via due process like they didn't just grab them and say hey [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5052.4400000000005s)]
*  We're shipping you off to an outside. No, but an immigration court said yes, you're up for deportation [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5056.84s)]
*  But the obama administration didn't give them this extra due process or you get a trial or you get but if you go through the courts [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5061.400000000001s)]
*  That's due process exactly an immigration court, which that's what president trump is also doing [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5068.28s)]
*  It's not just oh, they've never been in front of an immigration judge the guy from maryland didn't go through go go go through due process [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5073.32s)]
*  Two courts actually [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5079.72s)]
*  Not not only said that he was gang affiliated [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5081.64s)]
*  The local pd said he's gang affiliated a informant says he's gang affiliated [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5084.360000000001s)]
*  And but that has nothing to do with due process all that all that could be true courts already said [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5089.64s)]
*  You're gang affiliated and you're an illegal immigrant [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5094.360000000001s)]
*  I mean there was there's no dispute that he's an illegal immigrant and there's no dispute that the courts say he's gang affiliated [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5096.52s)]
*  But that has nothing to do with his due process. I'm with you [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5101.240000000001s)]
*  But that has nothing to do with his due process [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5103.56s)]
*  That just means that he has committed some crimes, but he's still allowed due process [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5105.16s)]
*  And I think that's where a lot of democrats are getting caught up in there's [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5109.0s)]
*  They're so focused on defending his character or what he may or may not have done [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5113.24s)]
*  We should just be talking about the due process that has allowed people within the constitution [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5117.24s)]
*  So do you want him to go in front of another immigration judge then? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5120.92s)]
*  I guess that's my question is that he's been in front of immigration judges [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5125.24s)]
*  He's in the country illegally and has been for many many years, right? [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5129.72s)]
*  You not only came to this country illegally, but then since then you have [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5133.64s)]
*  Protective orders against you your wife says she's scared of you your wife's ex-husband said hey [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5138.12s)]
*  I'm worried about my kids because my ex-wife is dating a gang member [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5143.4s)]
*  And you got caught on body cam footage allegedly trafficking people across my state of tennessee [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5147.879999999999s)]
*  So at some point it's like how much more how many more judges need to say this cat needs to leave [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5153.4s)]
*  And I would also ask this there are americans who are accused of being gang members all the time [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5158.679999999999s)]
*  And I feel that they get less benefit of the doubt than someone who came to this country illegally [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5164.2s)]
*  And that should infuriate americans that there are people sitting in jail right now who I feel [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5169.56s)]
*  Probably get less attention less advocacy and they're rotting in jail [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5175.0s)]
*  Than someone who came to our country illegally and then continued to break our laws and endanger people [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5179.16s)]
*  So that's my perspective and I get what you're saying about the due process. I understand that's that's literally the only conversation [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5184.28s)]
*  I'm not saying that he shouldn't even you know, i'm not saying that he should not be deported [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5189.64s)]
*  I'm just simply saying he should have to go through due process. That's it. I think that you know [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5192.92s)]
*  People like just keep saying oh he committed this crime. He committed that crime [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5197.56s)]
*  That has nothing to do with the due process that he's allowed within the constitution. We're still kicking with tomny lauren. Jess [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5200.2s)]
*  How do you protect your piece right? Because when people see tommy, right? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5206.6s)]
*  They can just see the commentator right and they like the controversial part of you [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5211.16s)]
*  But you're still a person first like how do you protect your piece with that for me? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5215.64s)]
*  First of all, do you get stressed? Yeah, and then if so, how do you protect your piece? Sorry [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5220.52s)]
*  You gotta have a thick skin [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5224.92s)]
*  You know it [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5226.68s)]
*  You know it you can't be in this business and be fragile [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5227.88s)]
*  No, you just can't and people are some people are just not gonna like you and I could sit here and I could [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5231.8s)]
*  Say anything and I could do anything and people some people are just not gonna like me [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5237.320000000001s)]
*  And I have to accept that and that's okay [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5242.040000000001s)]
*  But I really have learned to not care so much what people think especially if they had never met me before [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5244.280000000001s)]
*  That's my take on it. If you've met me and you're like, I don't like her. She's a bitch. Okay [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5248.6s)]
*  But if you've never met me [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5253.320000000001s)]
*  Just take take the chance and some people are never going to get the opportunity to understand that nobody's ever going to meet you [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5255.080000000001s)]
*  And have their personal opinion [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5259.160000000001s)]
*  I like to think and I believe that if people meet me like we're doing today that they can be like [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5260.76s)]
*  You know what? I disagree with her, but she's not like this monster [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5265.0s)]
*  I wish we could talk more to each other because I think if we stop villainizing people [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5267.8s)]
*  Based on what they do for a living or the opinions that they have [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5272.200000000001s)]
*  I feel like we could come together as a country and just say yeah, we agree to disagree [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5274.84s)]
*  But like I don't hate that person. I don't wish bad things on that person [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5277.72s)]
*  I hope we're getting there and I think more conversations like this help us to get there [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5281.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you think uh, the conservative movement even the liberal movement more so I guess on like cable news networks [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5286.04s)]
*  Do you think they're more concerned with influencing policy or just going viral? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5292.04s)]
*  I think there are people that are interested in going viral. Sure people are making money off of it now [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5295.8s)]
*  Like when I started doing it I wasn't making money off of it [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5300.599999999999s)]
*  Like I wasn't getting ad share revenue off of it [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5303.4s)]
*  And I wasn't on x trying to you know, do the engagement farming so I could get my check from x every month [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5305.8s)]
*  So I was just doing it because I really felt it [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5311.16s)]
*  There are people now that realize there is money in it [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5313.16s)]
*  So you can say crazy things and you can get a lot of clicks and people will talk about you [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5315.0s)]
*  Um, but you gotta live with yourself at night if you're doing it for that reason [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5318.76s)]
*  And if you're just doing it to get the attention and people can see through it [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5321.639999999999s)]
*  I think people are so good at detecting bs at this point and they can tell when someone's not genuine and they're just saying it [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5324.679999999999s)]
*  To say it or to go viral. I've never said anything that I don't believe [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5329.96s)]
*  For the purpose of going viral or making a headline or a sound bite. I've never done that once [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5334.04s)]
*  And i've taken real hits from my side of the aisle for things that i've said that didn't go along to get along [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5340.280000000001s)]
*  So I take it from both sides and like there's a for me. There's not a calculation that goes into it [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5346.92s)]
*  Have you ever changed your mind? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5352.120000000001s)]
*  Sure, i'm sure i've changed my mind i've evolved on things. Absolutely [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5355.080000000001s)]
*  You know and when you you're in this business and you're in it for long enough like you realize [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5359.64s)]
*  Oh, wow, some of the stuff that I said when I was 24 [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5363.88s)]
*  You know, maybe I wouldn't say today at 32 [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5367.240000000001s)]
*  You just you learn and you grow in the business. Do you feel like you fell? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5370.76s)]
*  Under the radar a little bit because the people now have a can of soans [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5374.68s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5380.280000000001s)]
*  See, but I don't maybe we're motivated by different things. I don't know what she's motivated by I couldn't tell you we're not friends [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5381.96s)]
*  More more than not friends. We're not friends. We're not friendly. You don't you don't like her. We're not friendly [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5387.96s)]
*  I haven't spoken to her in years and years and years, but we're not we're not y'all did speak before [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5394.44s)]
*  Uh, well in the business we have but I we've never been friendly [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5398.6s)]
*  Gotcha her and I have never been friendly. I don't know. She's gonna do her thing [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5402.28s)]
*  It's like a caitlin clark angel reese thing. Oh, I don't think so. I just we just are not we're not [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5405.96s)]
*  Friendly, we're just not friends and that's fine [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5411.4s)]
*  And she says some crazy stuff sometimes that I really disagree with I don't like a lot of her commentary [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5413.639999999999s)]
*  I like some of it. You know, I like some of your commentary and I don't like others whatever [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5418.599999999999s)]
*  But my motivations are very I think my innovations are different [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5423.24s)]
*  I don't know because that's that's her motivations are hers. I can't tell you what they are [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5425.879999999999s)]
*  I would never claim to know what someone's intentions are. I don't say things to be controversial [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5429.24s)]
*  For the purpose of being controversial to go viral to say things that and maybe she and she probably does believe them [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5435.0s)]
*  I'm not saying she doesn't believe them. I don't do that. You feel like she does though is what you're saying [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5440.84s)]
*  I don't I don't know why she does it like I really could not tell you and I would never sit here and say well [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5446.360000000001s)]
*  I know why someone does something because I don't know and I haven't spoken to her in many years if her and I were [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5450.76s)]
*  Sit down. I'd be like, hey, do you and she would ask me probably the same thing. Hey, do you believe everything? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5455.0s)]
*  You're saying yes, I do and I asked her she'd probably say yes [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5458.68s)]
*  I do [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5461.72s)]
*  You know we there could be many women that have platforms by the way [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5462.84s)]
*  I think that there's this notion that there can only be like two women in conservative media [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5465.64s)]
*  I want there to be a hundred women in conservative media with large platforms and in liberal media and in in between media and people who don't do [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5471.0s)]
*  Politics and media I want everybody to have a voice and the more voices that we have the more choices people have [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5479.0s)]
*  So I think that that's all part of the conversation [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5484.52s)]

*  Right. Leon thomas get busy. You see the young boy brandon [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5677.32s)]

*  I'm over here over there plotting like yeah, I gotta get that deluxe. No [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5687.96s)]
*  Brandon's got me and they're usually a little more um, less manipulative. Oh god me in all right [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5692.28s)]
*  That's what they want you to think that's part of the manipulation. No, look. He just went like yeah exactly [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5697.24s)]
*  I'd agree to that too. He got me [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5701.24s)]
*  All right, my last record is from an artist named k1. I actually interviewed her earlier this week [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5705.32s)]
*  She's based out of london. Um, make sure you guys tune into the interview we did on we need to talk [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5711.24s)]
*  It's actually really good and it's doing good numbers on youtube right now [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5715.64s)]
*  But she went viral earlier this year with her song called worst behavior with kalani [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5719.08s)]
*  Um, and now she's back with another one called do what I say which has been going viral on tiktok. I like it [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5722.92s)]

*  That 70s 80s 90s r&b so when I hear people in that pocket or at least trying to get to that [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5738.92s)]
*  I dig it because I have not liked a lot of the r&b that's come out [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5744.84s)]
*  Uh over the years, yeah, that's because they be trying to sound like rappers. I like when r&b sounds like r&b singers [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5747.72s)]
*  I don't want you to be a trans rapper. Yeah [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lPmgiFD4PE&t=5752.360000000001s)]
