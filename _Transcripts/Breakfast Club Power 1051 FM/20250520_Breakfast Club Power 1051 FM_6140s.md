*  Y'all started number one. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=123.72s)]
*  We're playing basketball. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=124.72s)]
*  I thought that was Bow Wow. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=126.72s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=127.72s)]

*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=131.72s)]
*  I do know we are the bricks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=132.72s)]
*  But no Bow Wow did sample that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=133.72s)]
*  That one did it over. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=134.72s)]
*  He did it over. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=135.72s)]
*  Okay, my bad, my bad. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=136.72s)]
*  Because the beauty of life is what you don't know you can learn. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=137.72s)]
*  And that's why Chuck D and Curtis Blow are here this morning. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=142.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=144.72s)]
*  And Chuck D also has a new project out and we'll talk to him all about it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=145.72s)]
*  It's called Radio Armageddon. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=148.72s)]
*  We'll talk about that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=149.72s)]
*  And then Raz Baraka will be joining us, the mayor of Newark. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=150.72s)]
*  I thought it was Raz. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=153.72s)]
*  I thought so too. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=154.72s)]
*  And I heard him on the news yesterday and he said Raz. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=155.72s)]
*  Was it a white person that said it? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=157.72s)]
*  No, it was himself. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=158.72s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=159.72s)]
*  It was himself. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=160.72s)]
*  I've been calling him Raz all this time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=161.72s)]
*  I've been calling him Mayor Raz Baraka all this time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=162.72s)]
*  He's never corrected me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=163.72s)]
*  I heard him on the news yesterday. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=164.72s)]
*  He was talking about himself. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=165.72s)]
*  He said Raz. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=166.72s)]
*  I said Raz? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=167.72s)]
*  He corrected white people. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=168.72s)]
*  He don't correct us, but he corrected white people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=169.72s)]
*  My bad, brother Raz. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=170.72s)]

*  How about Mayor Baraka? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=172.72s)]
*  Mayor Baraka will be joining us this morning. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=173.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=174.72s)]
*  Of course, he's running for governor of New Jersey. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=175.72s)]
*  He recently got arrested so he'll break all that down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=176.72s)]
*  What happened? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=177.72s)]

*  There is no stage 9. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=277.72s)]

*  test President Biden or they covered it up. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=284.5s)]
*  Yeah, I mean for you, you're not wrong about that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=287.72s)]
*  That ain't me now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=290.72s)]
*  I'm quoting with the doctor from Morning Joe. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=291.72s)]
*  And they were talking about his Gleason score was a level 9, which means it's very aggressive, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=293.72s)]
*  his Gleason score, but there is no stage 9 cancer. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=298.72s)]
*  No, yes, yes, okay. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=301.72s)]
*  Biden he addressed his cancer diagnosis in a post on X yesterday saying cancer touches all of us. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=304.72s)]
*  Of course it's been 10 years since Biden lost his son Bo to brain cancer. He went on to say [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  in the post that his first it's his first his first since the news broke on Sunday that like [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=314.0s)]
*  many of you Jill and him he learned that they were the strongest in the broken places. So [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=320.32000000000005s)]
*  the former president ended by thanking everyone for their well wishes and for lifting his family [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  up with love and support. In other presidential type news Trump is saying direct peace talks [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=330.71999999999997s)]
*  between Russia and Ukraine will start immediately. In a post on truth social Trump said his call with [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=336.64s)]
*  Russian president Vladimir Putin about war about the war with Ukraine went very well. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=342.8s)]
*  Now the two leaders spoke for almost two hours on Monday and Trump suggested the ceasefire talks [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=347.36s)]
*  take place at the Vatican. Meanwhile vice president JD Vance is questioning whether [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=352.32s)]
*  Russian president Vladimir Putin has an exit strategy strategy for the war in Ukraine. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=356.48s)]
*  Let's take a listen to JD Vance's comments. Look I think one open question is is is Vladimir Putin [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=361.68s)]
*  serious about negotiating peace right? He has made some concessions he has taken some serious steps [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  in these conversations but we feel like you know we're at a point where we're hitting an impasse [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=375.6s)]
*  and that's why the president is talking to him on the phone. I think honestly that president [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=379.84000000000003s)]
*  Putin he doesn't quite know how to get out of the war. So the Trump administration has recently [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=384.4s)]
*  expressed frustrations with both parties after they fail to reach a consensus on a 30-day ceasefire [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  proposal. So to be clear it's only talks about a ceasefire that's happening immediately not so much [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  this ceasefire itself. So I'll keep you guys posted on those talks and today president Trump will [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=400.08s)]
*  attend a house republican conference meeting as lawmakers work to pass what he calls his big [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=405.28s)]
*  beautiful bill. As previously reported the bill cleared the GOP-led budget committee in the house [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=410.16s)]
*  on Sunday. Trump is expected to make a proposal pitch to the legislation at the meeting today. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=416.0s)]
*  It includes a major spending increase for immigration enforcement and the military [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=421.6s)]
*  and of course extensions to Trump's 2017 tax cuts and cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and clean energy funding. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=426.16s)]
*  Now GOP lawmakers are looking at changes that could make house passage more difficult this week. I'm [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=434.16s)]
*  sure some of those cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP are going to be a little bit of a challenge [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=439.84s)]
*  for those house republicans but we will see. I'm actually going to head out to Capitol Hill after [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=446.23999999999995s)]

*  I'm starting to realize that people have not read Diddy's indictment. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1459.52s)]
*  Because if you read Diddy's indictment, you understand why they are putting those witnesses on the stand. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1461.52s)]
*  Because if you read Diddy's indictment, you understand why they are putting those witnesses on the stand. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1463.52s)]

*  Because in the indictment, Diddy is being accused of abusing, threatening, and coercing women and others. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1469.52s)]
*  And he led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1471.52s)]

*  And especially because Dawn talked a lot about Cassie wanting to have this amazing, bright, beautiful career and being excited. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1489.52s)]
*  And she said, I'm like, why did they do this with these two girls? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1491.52s)]

*  We gotta wrap up. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1729.52s)]

*  What you mean they gotta wrap up? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1733.52s)]
*  You ever suck a Jolly Rancher out of a hole? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1735.52s)]
*  Is that a honey pack? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1737.52s)]
*  The honey pack they buy at the gas station? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1739.52s)]
*  Oh yeah, that is. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1741.52s)]
*  Sucking a Jolly Rancher out of a hole. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1743.52s)]

*  Who is this? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1765.52s)]
*  When the White Dot was out? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1767.52s)]
*  You were original? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1769.52s)]
*  This is the Breakfast Club. Good morning. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1771.52s)]
*  As the police hunt for seven of the ten inmates [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1801.52s)]
*  who broke out of a New Orleans jail continues. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1803.52s)]
*  Now, Louisiana Republican Governor Jeff Landry [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1807.52s)]
*  claimed leaders and policies in New Orleans, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1809.52s)]
*  or progressive leaders and policies in New Orleans, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1813.52s)]
*  aided the escaped, but he is confident [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1815.52s)]
*  that all the inmates will be recaptured. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1817.52s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Louisiana Republican Governor Jeff Landry. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1821.52s)]
*  We have got hundreds of law enforcement agents [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1823.52s)]
*  that are working 24 and 7 around the clock [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1827.52s)]
*  hunting these folks down. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1829.52s)]
*  This is what happens when those people promise [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1831.52s)]
*  that to keep criminals out of jail, sadly, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1833.52s)]
*  you get ten of the most dangerous inmates [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1837.52s)]
*  that are in jail in Louisiana, they get to escape. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1839.52s)]
*  Yeah, they say they believe it was an inside job. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1843.52s)]
*  If you've seen the pictures, the fact that the toilet [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1845.52s)]
*  was connected to the wall that was connected to the outside, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1847.52s)]
*  and you could just dig right through it, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1849.52s)]
*  that just seems dumb as hell. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1851.52s)]
*  Leaders are saying that obviously somebody dropped the ball on this. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1853.52s)]
*  Now, the Democratic Orleans Parish DA, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1857.52s)]
*  District Attorney Jason Williams, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1859.52s)]
*  he disputes what Governor Landry is saying, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1861.52s)]
*  and he details what he was doing while Governor Landry [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1863.52s)]
*  was basically saying this guy is being soft on crime. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1866.52s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1870.52s)]
*  I was working, going through jail calls, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1874.52s)]
*  in an effort to try to figure out who might have been involved [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1878.52s)]
*  and knew of this planned jailbreak. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1882.52s)]
*  And it is frustrating that the Governor would not have [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1884.52s)]
*  just simply called me over the weekend. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1887.52s)]
*  My phone was on. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1890.52s)]
*  So Landry said the video of those prisoners escaping [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1892.52s)]
*  epitomizes a progressive criminal justice system. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1894.52s)]
*  Williams says that's not the case, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1898.52s)]
*  and he was actively working on their capture. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1900.52s)]
*  Now, the inmates face various charges, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1902.52s)]
*  including murder, domestic abuse, and felony firearm possession. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1904.52s)]
*  Landry has ordered the Louisiana Attorney General [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1907.52s)]
*  to investigate how the inmates escaped [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1910.52s)]
*  and who would be considered responsible [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1912.52s)]
*  as a result of their escape. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1915.52s)]
*  Now, meanwhile... [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1917.52s)]
*  All of them were... [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1919.52s)]
*  I heard all of them had murder charges, too. Is that true? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1920.52s)]
*  Not all of them, but I don't know. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1922.52s)]
*  Not all of them. No, they range from murder [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1923.52s)]
*  to domestic abuse, felony firearm possession, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1925.52s)]
*  so there are a few different charges. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1928.52s)]
*  But there is... Yeah, there's a murder amongst them. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1930.52s)]
*  I just wonder where you escaping. Like, where you going? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1932.52s)]
*  Like, you don't have no plan, you ain't got no money, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1934.52s)]
*  you ain't got no resources. Like, what you doing? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1936.52s)]
*  Just laying out in the woods? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1938.52s)]
*  And by the way, if you're facing like a life charge or something, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1939.52s)]
*  I mean, I can see you probably trying to escape [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1941.52s)]
*  just to go get like, you know, some gumballs, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1943.52s)]
*  a pole boy, you know, some pole bulls. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1945.52s)]
*  That's a fool to keep moving. That's all. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1947.52s)]
*  But they like, they found, I think, one in the French Quarter, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1949.52s)]
*  he was sleeping under a parked car. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1951.52s)]
*  Nothing else to do. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1953.52s)]
*  There was nowhere to go. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1954.52s)]
*  You left for jail, Sam. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1955.52s)]
*  With no money, nothing. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1956.52s)]
*  With a man. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1957.52s)]
*  And a toilet to go sleep under a car. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1958.52s)]
*  Did y'all see like the hole that they were supposedly like sneaking through? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1960.52s)]
*  It don't even look like they could fit through that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1963.52s)]
*  And that big pole going down the middle, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1965.52s)]
*  how they can get through that? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1967.52s)]
*  That's what prison is all about. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1969.52s)]
*  Big poles going in the holes that you can barely fit through. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1970.52s)]
*  Yo! [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1973.52s)]
*  Jesus! [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1974.52s)]
*  That's what prison is all about. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1975.52s)]
*  It's the one that fell in the video for me. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1977.52s)]
*  I'm like, how you gonna fall just as soon as you get out? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1979.52s)]
*  Girl, they was so excited to go. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1981.52s)]
*  He ain't know what to do. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1983.52s)]
*  Yeah, to your point, Envy. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1984.52s)]
*  One was also captured in an abandoned warehouse. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1986.52s)]
*  So yeah, we'll see what happens. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1988.52s)]
*  Damn. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1990.52s)]
*  As we speak of this, yeah. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1991.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, interim U.S. Attorney General [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1992.52s)]
*  for the District of New Jersey, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1994.52s)]
*  Alina Habba is announcing charges against New Jersey Democrat [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=1996.52s)]
*  LaMonica McIver over an incident at an ICE detention center this month. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2000.52s)]
*  Now, McIver is being charged with assaulting law enforcement [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2005.52s)]
*  while at the detention center in Newark, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2007.52s)]
*  making the first time President Trump's DOJ has criminally charged [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2009.52s)]
*  a sitting lawmaker during his second term. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2013.52s)]
*  Now, Habba said McIver's conduct cannot be overlooked, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2015.52s)]
*  accusing the Congresswoman of assaulting, resisting, and impeding law enforcement. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2019.52s)]
*  McIver said in a statement that she was performing her lawful oversight responsibilities. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2023.52s)]
*  Now, this is in tandem with that issue that is going on with the Newark city mayor. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2028.52s)]
*  Ras Baraka is his name? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2033.52s)]
*  Yeah, we've been calling him. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2036.52s)]
*  I've been calling him Mayor Ras Baraka for years. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2037.52s)]
*  What Envy said this morning is Ras. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2039.52s)]
*  I heard it on the news and I heard him, he called himself Ras. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2041.52s)]
*  So we're looking it up to get his proper pronunciation. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2044.52s)]
*  But you know, yeah, you mentioned earlier that his charges has been dropped. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2046.52s)]
*  Well, in tandem with that, she has now been charged. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2049.52s)]
*  And in that situation, so I'm going to continue to keep you guys posted as to what happens as a result of these charges being brought against this elected official, Lamar Lamar, Monica McIver in New Jersey. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2052.52s)]

*  Hello. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2102.52s)]
*  Good seeing y'all. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2103.52s)]
*  Now, this is a great surprise. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2104.52s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2106.52s)]
*  I had to roll up here with the Godfather. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2107.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2109.52s)]
*  We have the Godfather, Curtis Blow. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2110.52s)]
*  Welcome, brother. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2111.52s)]
*  How are you feeling? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2112.52s)]
*  I'm feeling mighty fine. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2113.52s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2114.52s)]
*  Great to see both of you, brothers. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2115.52s)]
*  What does Curtis Blow mean to you, Chuck, but also the culture of hip hop? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2117.52s)]
*  He's number one. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2121.52s)]
*  He is the pioneer because he is the first solo artist to record with a major record label of rap music and hip hop. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2122.52s)]
*  And at the same time, was the first to be on a major record label. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2131.52s)]
*  So he left that indelible mark. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2135.52s)]
*  1979 and 1980, just at, you know, and that was the jump. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2138.52s)]
*  And you're talking about a city that has had a million MCs and rappers and DJs. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2143.52s)]
*  That's why it's important to be here. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2150.52s)]
*  Just to say everybody else has been in this city that would have been born and have passed on since. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2152.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2158.52s)]
*  This is the city that made it. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2159.52s)]
*  Just like I had to represent, just for a quick second, the Knicks tonight. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2160.52s)]
*  Knicks, that's right. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2163.52s)]
*  Knicks and Six. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2164.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2165.52s)]
*  Let's go back to my man CP the Fantas over there. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2166.52s)]
*  So, but basically my talk today on the radio station, I cannot, you know, have the brand associated with all the things I say. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2169.52s)]
*  I gotcha. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2177.52s)]
*  So I say the Godfather's right here. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2178.52s)]
*  And yeah, I came up here to talk about, you know, a recording that was released on Def Jam called Radio Armageddon. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2180.52s)]
*  But I'm over at Def Jam, sort of like a consigliere, like the like the Tom and the Godfather. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2187.52s)]
*  You know, like what Toonji Belongan has done. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2192.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2195.52s)]
*  And anytime they run into a situation, I remind the major labels and Def Jam and everybody else, you got accountability and responsibility. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2196.52s)]
*  1979, this man recorded with Mercury Records. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2205.52s)]
*  And I benefited off of that because I did a solo record with Mercury in 1996. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2208.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2213.52s)]
*  So thank you, Kurt. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2214.52s)]
*  You're welcome, man. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2215.52s)]
*  I want to shout out all the legends who have pioneered this thing before myself. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2216.52s)]
*  Name them, Kurt. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2222.52s)]
*  And inspired me. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2223.52s)]
*  Name them, Kurt. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2224.52s)]
*  People like DJ Jones and Cool Herc, Africa Bambada, Grandmaster Flash, Melly Mel, DJ Hollywood, Lovebug Staski, Eddie Chiba, The Furious Five, The Funky Four, The Fantas, The Five, The Treacherous Three, The Fearless Four. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2225.52s)]
*  So many groups, man. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2242.52s)]
*  I love you all. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2244.52s)]
*  And thank you, thank you, thank you for inspiring me. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2245.52s)]
*  And we will move forward to the future and inspire the future generations to come. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2248.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2255.52s)]
*  I want to ask you, Mr. Blow, like what do you think? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2256.52s)]
*  I'm going to ask both of y'all. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2258.52s)]
*  What do you think the culture lost when hip hop went corporate? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2259.52s)]
*  And what do you think it gained? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2261.52s)]
*  Well, number one, you know, it grows big on the top heavy side, but all the bottom in the middle started getting gutted out. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2263.52s)]
*  Don't you all get a little envious when you see every single NBA player? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2269.52s)]
*  Well, 90% of them, they carry themselves on interviews. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2273.52s)]
*  We learned in the beginning when Curtis Blow did an interview, he spoke for us on TV, whether it's Don, he's the first to get interviewed by Don Cornelis. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2276.52s)]
*  He's the first to get interviewed by Dick Clark. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2283.52s)]
*  So we come in from the rap circles, doing our DJs and MCing and all that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2285.52s)]
*  And here's this man being interviewed. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2290.52s)]
*  He's speaking for all of us. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2292.52s)]
*  Now he could go up there on some Goon Squad issue, right? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2293.52s)]
*  But what would that do? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2296.52s)]
*  What would that do? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2297.52s)]
*  Would that have elevated the art form into an area where we started discussing what we gained and what we lost? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2298.52s)]
*  You know, every time you look at an NBA player, 95% of them, NFL player or Major League Baseball player, even if they're doing English or Espanol, and a lot of it's Espanol, they have to sell the game to the fans. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2305.52s)]
*  And the thing that we've lost, back to your question to God, is that it's been piss poor in public relations and human resources. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2319.52s)]
*  Every big business makes sure that they're tied in tight with their public relations and their human resource department. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2327.52s)]
*  If not, I mean, this radio station probably doesn't. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2334.52s)]
*  You know, a letter from an old lady probably still works in this building. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2336.52s)]
*  An old white lady. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2341.52s)]
*  But it's hard to have that now because of social media, because you got human emotion and an ability to be able to go directly to the consumer. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2342.52s)]
*  Screen ages have never been taught netherkitt. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2350.52s)]
*  Screen ages, wow. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2353.52s)]
*  You don't have citizens today. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2354.52s)]
*  You have netizens. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2356.52s)]
*  They're not citizens anymore. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2357.52s)]
*  They're netizens. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2359.52s)]
*  They're screen ages. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2360.52s)]
*  They're engaged by everything in and out of the screen. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2361.52s)]
*  Their life goes through a screen. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2363.52s)]
*  But what has taught them, you know, how to engage on their devices? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2364.52s)]
*  That's true. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2368.52s)]
*  What has taught them how to engage on their gadgets? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2369.52s)]
*  At the end of the day, there's only two phone companies, there's Android and Apple. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2371.52s)]
*  At the end of the day, they're the keep little elves looking at everybody. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2376.52s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you know, say and do whatever you want. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2380.52s)]
*  Still gonna roll down our river. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2383.52s)]
*  So when we start to understand, you know, what's behind what, you know, we can all, okay, this is the way everybody lives. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2385.52s)]
*  Okay, how do we manage that? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2392.52s)]
*  Same thing with life. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2393.52s)]
*  And, you know, Curtis Blow is instrumental with Scott Exe. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2394.52s)]
*  He'll tell you he speaks for himself because he taught all us the first hip hop union. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2397.52s)]
*  So the whole thing is all the information that we say that we have in these gadgets and devices. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2401.52s)]
*  Oh, oh, we could get it quick and all that. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2405.52s)]
*  We are not equipped on how to navigate that information. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2407.52s)]
*  Oh, yo, we need a union. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2412.52s)]
*  How many people we've heard talk about we need a union? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2414.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2417.52s)]
*  When it's easy to go, boop, boop, boop, hip hop union, hip hop alliance. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2418.52s)]
*  So we have these things. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2421.52s)]
*  We really don't know how to use them. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2423.52s)]
*  When I came up with the radio Armageddon, which is basically like the MC DJ aspect of Public Enemy works with that. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2425.52s)]
*  And it's a way of introducing people like from Daddy-O to Miranda Wright. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2433.52s)]
*  So it's a quirky project. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2439.52s)]
*  It's like the weirdness in my head. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2441.52s)]
*  I don't make records or sell records. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2443.52s)]
*  I make records that almost like we're not too far from Momo, right? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2445.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2449.52s)]
*  It's got to be an art and a craft somewhere. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2450.52s)]
*  I want to say I love the song New Generation. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2453.52s)]
*  And you say on that song, I've been your age. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2456.52s)]
*  You haven't been mine yet. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2458.52s)]
*  But I wonder, even though we've been these kids age, we didn't grow up in their generation, didn't have access to the things that they have now. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2460.52s)]
*  So how how much can we truly relate? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2468.52s)]
*  Even though we have been there, we just haven't been there ageing this time frame. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2471.52s)]
*  Got to work on it. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2475.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what it's like to pull an egg out chicken's ass either. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2476.52s)]
*  I mean, to me, milk means go to the store, get a carton. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2483.52s)]
*  So that generation before me, you know, looked at me like, you don't know what that is. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2487.52s)]
*  So we have to do our best on logic and practical sense. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2492.52s)]
*  We have to work on these things at all times and we can't probably rely on systems and school system. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2498.52s)]
*  Before we had an area of culture that snuck it in, covert. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2504.52s)]
*  Hip hop was a covert operation, remember, because at the time they totally gave up on school systems. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2509.52s)]
*  You know, they talk about, oh, man, Columbine. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2516.52s)]
*  But we had a 10 to 15 year period once guns and drugs came in our community where high school shootings in major urban cities, especially United States, they, you know, they became like a little bit of an epidemic before it became a national epidemic across the board. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2518.52s)]
*  Very easy. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2534.52s)]
*  Very easy. This all years to culture, you know, no, but there's there's some lapses that no planet to seed. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2535.52s)]
*  So anyway, bring it full circle. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2540.52s)]
*  The hip hop alliance of all with Kurt reached out some years ago. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2543.52s)]
*  Yeah, but you can speak for yourself. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2548.52s)]
*  You know, well, you know, the hip hop alliance is just that the alliance is an organization that is a labor force organization. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2549.52s)]
*  There needs to be a system to monitor, to actually communicate and educate to the youth through our community. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2560.52s)]
*  You know, we're out on a mission fighting for fair wages and fair royalties and strong health and retirement benefits for all of our people. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2570.52s)]

*  We are out there fighting for you to make sure this journey that you are on in your career is successful. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2594.52s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Chuck D and Curtis Blow. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2604.52s)]
*  Hello. I want to ask with Def Jam, of course, this project is under Def Jam. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2607.52s)]
*  Will you always sign the Def Jam or was it a re-sign? Have you been with Def Jam that long? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2612.52s)]
*  I was the first rapper they had a bit. They didn't have a bit more. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2617.52s)]
*  I turned Rick Rubin down for two years. Why? I didn't want to do records. My thing was radio. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2621.52s)]
*  We felt my guys, one of the first and Kurt could tell you, I mean, we broke so many records in Long Island, WBAU. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2626.52s)]
*  We did records right. We did hip hop right. We were scientists. We were ESPN of hip hop and rap music. We just ain't from the city. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2634.52s)]
*  So we had the outside in. We promoted gigs, we've got concerts. We did it all. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2641.52s)]
*  We used to compensate for the lack of rap records by making incredible tapes and promo tapes. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2646.52s)]
*  And Rick was starting Def Jam with, you know, Curtis Blow's friend Russell. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2652.52s)]
*  Why you say that? For two years. Not your friend? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2656.52s)]
*  Oh yeah, Russell's my friend. But he started out with Kurt. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2660.52s)]
*  Matter of fact, more trivia, Kurt and Russell used to throw gigs in the 70s. And then Kurt's Russell's first artist. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2665.52s)]
*  Yes, yes. We had a club in Hollis Queens called the Night Fever Disco back in 1977, 78. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2675.52s)]
*  I was a DJ playing every weekend and I used to stay at Russell's house over in Hollis, 25th Street. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2685.52s)]
*  And when I was there, I met his younger brother and he used to beat him up all the time. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2692.52s)]
*  I used to protect. My big brother used to beat me up all the time. So I was like, yo, leave him alone. He's a good kid. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2697.52s)]
*  You know, I took him under my wing and made him the son of Curtis Blow. And that was DJ Run. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2705.52s)]
*  Of course. I told him how to DJ and he became incredible on the mic. He was my DJ when I released Christmas rap in 1979. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2713.52s)]
*  And nasty too. We had eight million stories about that whole situation. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2723.52s)]
*  Run was incredible. I loved the family. Danny, Joey, Russell, his dad rest in peace, his mom resting in peace. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2729.52s)]
*  And that was people. The Night Fever Disco. I mean, I remember we brought Flash out to the Night Fever Disco. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2738.52s)]
*  The first time Flash ever played in Queens. And that was incredible just to be that liaison to the Bronx and represent early hip hop in Queens with that whole crew, the Hollis crew. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2746.52s)]
*  I want to ask you, Mr. Blow, was there ever a time in the 80s where you knew hip hop was about to explode but you didn't feel ready for what came next? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2761.52s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I was definitely a visionary. I hate to talk and brag about that. It was incredible. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2768.52s)]
*  It was incredible. And just the feeling. I remember Chuck D. saying that whole energy, that spirit. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2778.52s)]
*  Before records? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2784.52s)]
*  Between 1975 and 1979 was the most incredible spirit. I mean, it had spread throughout the whole five boroughs. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2786.52s)]
*  From Harlem to Bronx to Queens to Brooklyn. And it was just an energy that everyone knew that this was something special. And we capitalized on it. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2798.52s)]
*  Yeah, you couldn't even describe it. It's hard to describe already that era before records because before that it was inconceivable to put rap on records. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2811.52s)]
*  It's a three hour thing. It got dancing. It got all. How you put rap on records? Yeah, you get on the mic. But how long the record got beat? Three hours? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2822.52s)]
*  But then in 79, King Tim III, Sugarhill Gang, which took two records. People were like, oh, it's a good time. No, it's two records that made Sugarhill Gang love deluxe. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2831.52s)]
*  And then, yeah, Curtis Blow with Christmas rap, which just took it into the stratosphere. And like I said, back to your new gins thing, it's like youth is an excuse that I don't let young people do. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2846.52s)]
*  Because it's easy. You can't. I mean, I'm triple OG. There's no way I'm going to convince a person, a teenager. That communication got to come from the next step up that they want to get to. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2858.52s)]
*  So all I do is just I weigh them against themselves. Somebody think, oh, I'm too young for that. They'd be 16. I'm like, OK, your 12 year old brother is going to actually get all your props and everything. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2872.52s)]
*  Well, I earn that. So everybody in their life wants to use tenure. You know, the drug game changed all that and flipped that up because they say overnight boom boom. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2883.52s)]
*  We saw what happened to that and when that was introduced, a lot of things came during the era of R&B. That's Reagan and Bush. And when that came in, we're still recovering off of that scar tissue. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2893.52s)]
*  Did you approach radio Armageddon like a broadcaster, a prophet or a rebel? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2907.52s)]
*  All three, man. All three. All three. So I mean, dipped in acid with Wu-Tang axes in the back and hammer shoes and all that. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2914.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? It's like in my head. I mean, my first record is Public Enemy Number One, which is a tone which is blow your head by the J.B.'s. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2924.52s)]
*  You know, a very familiar break beat, but nobody could figure it out. I'm from skater culture and not the skater culture today. Roller skating coach. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2933.52s)]
*  I believe that skating rinks can be a possibility for enjoyment of future music and future cardio. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2942.52s)]
*  Because one thing being the screen agent, you said in Terry, you said this screen all day long and you'll trust me. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2950.52s)]
*  I mean, a song that's on the album, I want to attack ageism and the sedentary life and all that is Black Don't Dead. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2958.52s)]
*  You hear the talk, we take for granted. You're from South Carolina. So you know a lot of talk of, yeah, yeah, black don't crack. Yeah, but we die. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2967.52s)]
*  Yeah, for real. I'm glad you bought that record because I listen to records like Black Don't Dead and it makes me wonder, did making radio Armageddon feel like a spiritual purge or final warning? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2975.52s)]
*  No, none of that. I say that for Public Enemy Records. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2985.52s)]
*  This is taking a radio and throwing it down the flight of the stands and seeing it still work. It's not meant for people to like. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2990.52s)]
*  I made Public Enemy Records, man, not for nobody to like. I told Rick Rubin, though. He's the greatest producer. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=2998.52s)]
*  Rick Rubin's the greatest one of the greatest producers of all time. Yes. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3004.52s)]
*  Whoever told him no? You? I was wanted. There's certain qualities back in the day that Kurt also knows too. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3007.52s)]
*  If you didn't have a voice that rocked the mic, I mean, sounded good, you wasn't getting the mic. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3014.52s)]
*  I don't care how many verses you got bars, you got it. If you sounded like you was 15 years old, you had to take up something else. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3018.52s)]
*  You had to dance, maybe DJs and stuff like that. You had to command the crowd like Hollywood, Curtis Blow, Starsky. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3024.52s)]
*  They command, well, Melly Mel. When they grabbed the mic, people just sat down because I can't sound like that. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3031.52s)]
*  Studios balanced that stuff out and this and all that, but I never, ever, ever made a song for somebody else to like. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3038.52s)]
*  That's like asking somebody else, how do I look? After you went to the mirror, brush yourself up and asking somebody else, how do you look? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3046.52s)]
*  But being screen agents, people listen with their eyes today. A little bit too much with their eyes. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3054.52s)]
*  You could tell them, they might listen, but do they hear it? So there's a lot of covert now happening when you could be told the truth, but if you don't see it, you know, now it's the flip verse with that. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3060.52s)]
*  It's like believe none of what you see and half of what you hear. People ain't listening. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3073.52s)]
*  Believe at least half of what you hear and dissect that. But as far as seeing, especially with AI, and I've been dancing and boxing with AI for like the last five years. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3078.52s)]
*  I'm trying to tell you, it don't go backwards. It ain't gonna get dumber. Yes, there is an issue there in real life and regular life and in culture and music and art and all that. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3087.52s)]
*  You're not gonna stop it, but you can dance with it and you can manipulate it. You can flip it, but you better know how to dance. You better know what it is. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3098.52s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Chuck D and Curtis Blow. Charlamagne? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3105.52s)]
*  Is hip hop still the best weapon for revolution? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3109.52s)]
*  No, everybody got a gadget from your grandmother to the child being born. Something better come through that. We don't know what that is. Remember I said hip hop was covert? Was. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3111.52s)]
*  It ain't covert. That was dumb before Fight the Power, bro. Fight the Power became what it was because of Spike Lee. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3121.52s)]
*  Okay. I mean who does that play, you know, plays a song in a movie 500 times and nobody did that. Yeah. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3130.52s)]
*  Spike made that record happen. What was your relationship with Spike for him to do that? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3137.52s)]
*  At that time in the 80s man and like I said this comes from the seed of Curtis Blow. It was a renaissance period of filmmakers, artists, hip hop that were all being independently creative and using those tools out of the ashes that was bestowed upon us. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3140.52s)]
*  Look at the key. People talk about Fight the Power like because it's the headline buzzword decades later. Oh, yeah, yeah. Cool. You know, we buy that. They fail to realize or they wasn't taught. I had to always tell people there was a first Fight the Power by the Isley brothers in 1975 that me and Kurt was influenced by. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3155.52s)]
*  What's going on with that? I don't know. Yeah. Fight the Power by the Isley brothers. I thought it was... I didn't even know that. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3171.52s)]
*  1975 and remember I told you that the country is rocky, you know, and and Isley came up with tied all that BS going down. First record I ever heard on pop radio with a black radio with a curse word in it. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3176.52s)]
*  Wow. Really? Yeah. I was like, whoa, be on WWRL Super 16 and then I'm going to play some Fight the Power people like on the whole tape, Gary Bird. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3188.52s)]
*  Here's another thing about OGs. This city right here, when you have a tenured lens of any place you go to, whether it's where you're from or whatever, Queens, you still see the old buildings that was there. I still see the old buildings, although they've been replaced by new buildings. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3199.52s)]
*  That's third eye vision, man. You're able to see the past, present and the future that they're building. New heads come along in their generation probably only can see what they see. That's why it's, you know, deeper than your ear can hear or your eye can see. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3214.52s)]
*  I go around walk down this street. I'm saying, oh, that place used to be there. Boom, boom, boom. The whole key is to keep your recognition or what they call your cognitive. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3228.52s)]
*  Cognitive dissonance, right? Thank you, sir. Yeah. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3238.52s)]
*  Keep that because that will help you. Kurt says, you know, like I said, I'm not in the business of wellness. You have people like, you know, Griff who taught wellness for years, you know, look at Flav. Flav has gone through his ninth life. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3242.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like I went down to Penn Station the other day and ran into the, what's the, the Canes. I didn't know what the Canes chicken was. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3255.52s)]
*  Oh, Ray the Cane. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3263.52s)]
*  You go all over the place. So the whole key is about work on your thing. Here's another thing. It's not talking about anybody, but rap battles and beefs. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3265.52s)]
*  You don't want to get into an area where you, you rhyming in circles, man. Rhyming in circles means like the dog chasing his tail. It's rhymes that go nowhere. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3275.52s)]
*  You know, it's cool. It's cool to get into like lyrical acrobatics and all that. But at the end, you got to process something into something. And if the best processes is somebody just like seriously disrespecting you. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3284.52s)]
*  How does that not leave a stain over decades? When the last time you said I came from a hip hop song and this joint was refreshing. P Rock C.L. Smooth. You throw a P Rock C.L. Smooth record on. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3297.52s)]
*  Like yo man, this is like nutrition. Roy Rock him. Rock him has never done a failing song ever. I've never heard Rock him do a song and say like that. But where's the support in it? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3308.52s)]
*  Caris one has never ever lost. But you know, it's very easy to excuse it because this is what's happening now and all that. Cool. But I feel like that with a lot of people though. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3321.52s)]
*  Like I feel like that with Kendrick. I feel like that with like Rhapsody. Like this week I was watching Joey Badass and Ab Soul and Big Sean do a cypher. And I thought that was I got to use the right word. I was like that was refreshing. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3332.52s)]
*  That was dope. People like La Russell. Promoters look back in the day and Curtis tell you. Promoters will tell you exactly how it rolls. They'll give you a top. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3344.52s)]
*  Let's say you got six rappers. Six groups. What a promoter say Kurt. The one that's closing out is the one. The one that closes out the building. Not just because people came to see because there's a difference between spectacle and spectacular. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3353.52s)]
*  I tell people this all the time. There's a big difference. Hopefully you could get people coming through there and stay in their seats. Get to that level. Yeah. You got somebody in the middle that can't hold it. They off the tour. They out of there. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3366.52s)]
*  But get how many records they sold. If they can't be better than they record out of there. Chuck you would like a Kendrick show. I would. He's an MC. And to see him perform in front of in that arena in that football stadium just rapping. No gimmicks. No nothing. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3378.52s)]
*  This is the first man that came out as one man and I thought being one man could never beat a group. And he came out as one man. Because back in the day it was like what? Cruz. And then this man began the next solo MC who was a superstar as LL Cool J. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3395.52s)]
*  First superstar. Hunk rap's first superstar. Absolutely. You make Prince and Michael Jackson turn their head. Curtis made all the funk bands and all people recognize him. This thing is real. I mean look why am I talking for the man? He played with Bob Marley. He played with the class and all that. He dug tomatoes from rock groups. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3413.52s)]
*  I wanted to ask Mr. Blow because you spoke about the Ronald Isley fight the power. My daddy used to always tell me James Brown was the first rapper. So I think about a song like Say It Loud I'm Black and I'm Proud. That was revolutionary for his time. Stuff like that influenced you. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3431.52s)]
*  1968. Oh yes. Yes. Yes. And that's straight out of the civil rights movement. You know that inspired all of us in many ways. Multiple number of ways. Not only the lyric but the beat. That beat was what we call boom-back today. And dancing became a national craze. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3444.52s)]
*  So then here comes DJ Curtis Blow. I'm hearing all this stuff and I got an opportunity to make a couple of records. Christmas rap in 1979. So when I did that song I was signed to a major label over in Chicago. So I went to Chicago the first flight out of Harlem. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3466.52s)]
*  And I was there. I was hanging out with the record company and I did a show. A couple of shows. And Jesse Jackson came to one of my shows. And he sat me down backstage. He said Ben I want to talk to you. I want you to. When I'm going to say to you I want you to go back and tell the rest of your whole crew. And everybody. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3488.52s)]
*  Now this thing called rap. You guys are the new icons of our people. The new heroes of the civil rights movement. And you need to keep it clean if you ever want to see it be successful on the pop market. And be accepted by everyone. So I was like oh wow. Okay. And we would keep it clean. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3511.52s)]
*  And that was my sacrifice. That was the sacrifice I made. I made 240 rap songs and never used profanity. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3535.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3543.52s)]
*  I've learned so much from both of y'all today man. I just want to ask are we in an information war or a culture war? And which one is radio Armageddon fighting? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3544.52s)]
*  You're in a disinformation blizzard of data coming at the human mind that might not be and has probably never been able to handle it. Now new people will be born and maybe they'll decipher and handle information that's coming like a blizzard. But for people from the last century, last centurions, probably not. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3553.52s)]
*  So the information and data and all that, it's a nonstop blizzard. And how to navigate that I think people have to be taught how to be netizens. But there's things that we're not going to be able to come up with answers for that we got to go inside ourselves, build a shell, and build a tunnel into those with like mindedness. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3574.52s)]
*  Because you're not going to be able to have your like not mindedness get to somebody who's paying you no mind. Mind over matter is a terrible thing sometimes, you know. When they say you don't matter and they don't mind paying you no mind. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3596.52s)]
*  Dang. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3608.52s)]

*  Y'all Magda Stallion is stressed out behind this Tory Lanez and this whole new, I guess it's not even new, but it has a new light. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3662.52s)]
*  This free Tory movement. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3671.52s)]
*  She posted the TikTok yesterday following everything, right? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3672.52s)]
*  All of these people doing these change.org petitions and saying Tory should be free and he didn't shoot her. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3675.52s)]
*  And she said, at what point are y'all going to stop making me have to relive being shot by Tory? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3680.52s)]
*  At what point are Tory and y'all fans going to stop lying? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3685.52s)]
*  Like how much is the check to keep harassing me? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3688.52s)]
*  Why is this happening every day? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3691.52s)]
*  One minute him and y'all said I was never shot. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3693.52s)]
*  Now y'all letting him play in your face again and say I was shot, but it wasn't him. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3695.52s)]
*  OK, I'm sick of this. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3699.52s)]
*  Leave me alone. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3701.52s)]
*  He ain't dare get on that stand and deny he shot me. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3702.52s)]
*  That was his choice because he knows he did that. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3704.52s)]
*  I don't give a F about a blog or a bot. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3706.52s)]
*  Why in the F would me, Magda Stallion have to lie on this about someone shooting me? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3709.52s)]
*  How y'all mad at the person that got shot? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3715.52s)]
*  Facts are facts. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3717.52s)]
*  He did it. It was proven in court. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3718.52s)]
*  Let the hate forget the hate campaign on the Internet. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3720.52s)]
*  Tory, you shot me. Ain't no new evidence. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3723.52s)]
*  Y'all been saying the same thing for years. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3726.52s)]
*  Tory, please leave me alone in all caps. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3728.52s)]
*  If she caught him a demon and she said I'm off this Internet stuff. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3730.52s)]
*  Bye. She posted that to our TikTok yesterday because there's been so much like you got different political pundits coming out now saying that they want the DA's office in LA to revisit the case [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3734.52s)]
*  because he was railroaded and there's a lot of conversations that have been happening. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3746.52s)]
*  Is it because he got stabbed? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3750.52s)]
*  Well, I think his attorneys, I mean, they're his attorneys. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3751.52s)]
*  They were smart to use, you know, him being stabbed as a hay. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3754.52s)]
*  His life is in danger and not only is his life is in danger, but we have new evidence down that shows he shouldn't even be there. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3758.52s)]
*  So we need for you guys to listen to us because of what just happened to him. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3764.52s)]
*  Well, everybody in prison, their life is in danger pretty much. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3767.52s)]
*  Well, you know what I mean? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3771.52s)]
*  You get stabbed 14 times. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3772.52s)]
*  Of course, your people going to say he's innocent and he shouldn't be there. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3774.52s)]
*  So if he dies, his blood is on the hands of the people that wouldn't let him retry. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3777.52s)]
*  I can understand Meg's frustration though, because as I said, I think it's strange that a court case happened due process, all the evidence that was presented in court, weeks and weeks of testimony and evidence. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3780.52s)]
*  All that goes out the window because the driver allegedly overheard Kelsey say something. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3791.52s)]
*  Only that only makes sense on the Internet, by the way. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3795.52s)]
*  I want you all to know. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3799.52s)]
*  Well, yeah, she's asking to be left alone. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3800.52s)]
*  So that's what that is about is that it don't really got to do with him being stabbed. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3804.52s)]
*  It's about the new piece of evidence that came forward, I guess. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3807.52s)]
*  It's both things. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3811.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I heavily that heavily the new evidence that they're saying that they have and that's what they're moving forward with in court. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3812.52s)]
*  But they're also mentioning his attorneys are also mentioning the stabbing just happened. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3817.52s)]
*  And, you know, it shows that there is, you know, he's very dangerous. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3821.52s)]
*  He's dangerous. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3825.52s)]
*  He could die. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3826.52s)]
*  They're trying to pin it on like they're trying to, you know, they're alleging that Meg's, you know, once they reach out to make teen certain things happen, like it's a whole play that you put together as an attorney strategy. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3827.52s)]
*  But it's driving her insane, according to what she's supposed to. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3838.52s)]
*  She has to relive everything that she went through, you know, the last what, two, three years. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3841.52s)]
*  So, right. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3844.52s)]
*  And I just ask a simple question. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3845.52s)]
*  Why would Tory protect Kelsey? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3847.52s)]
*  And if everybody says, oh, because you don't want to snitch and all that. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3849.52s)]
*  OK, cool. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3851.52s)]
*  But why would Meg protect Kelsey? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3852.52s)]
*  The reason would make have to say, you know what it was, she didn't shoot me if she actually shot her. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3854.52s)]
*  When they best friends. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3859.52s)]
*  Yes, they were. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3860.52s)]
*  They were. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3861.52s)]
*  Oh, but it's like, yeah, yeah. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3862.52s)]
*  And some were saying that they were they were too intoxicated to remember. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3865.52s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3868.52s)]
*  OK, got you. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3869.52s)]
*  And that's why Meg is pissed off. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3870.52s)]
*  For sure. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3872.52s)]
*  I get it. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3873.52s)]
*  Well, in other news, another court related news, Sky Jackson from Disney Channel actor from the Disney Channel. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3874.52s)]
*  Remember, she had a baby and everyone's like, oh, my gosh, she's having a baby. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3879.52s)]
*  Well, now she's in court saying that the father of her child is terrorizing her and has been for more than a year now. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3882.52s)]
*  And she says that she decided to come to a court after there was a Mother's Day Mother's Day assault that took place. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3888.52s)]
*  I was the last straw. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3893.52s)]
*  So she filed for restraining order in L.A. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3894.52s)]
*  Superior Court in the docks. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3896.52s)]

*  And this happened on Mother's Day. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3904.52s)]
*  She says that he grabbed the baby. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3906.52s)]

*  That's crazy. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3912.52s)]
*  OK, don't finish your story. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3913.52s)]
*  The story. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3915.52s)]
*  Lauren, what is wrong with you? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3916.52s)]
*  That is wild. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3917.52s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3918.52s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3919.52s)]
*  Say it. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3920.52s)]
*  They're in together. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3921.52s)]
*  They want some couple-ish. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3922.52s)]
*  Oh, it's couple stuff? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3923.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3925.52s)]
*  Speaking of couple, her baby daddy is terrorizing her. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3926.52s)]
*  Thank you, Jax. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3929.52s)]

*  Because it's you. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3931.52s)]
*  He came up and what he do? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3932.52s)]
*  He yank the baby out of hands. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3933.52s)]
*  What happened? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3934.52s)]
*  No, he grabbed her by her hair, slammed her head against a car window and punched her in the face allegedly. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3935.52s)]
*  Damn! [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3939.52s)]
*  Jesus! [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3940.52s)]
*  But Sky is claiming that this new type of violence, I mean this violence is nothing new. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3941.52s)]
*  And she says that she describes a six month period in 2024 where he would abuse her on a weekly basis, choking and scratching her, slamming her head into walls. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3945.52s)]
*  And she also alleges that he damaged a bunch of her personal property, including her iPhone and a television. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3954.52s)]
*  And she also says that while she was pregnant, he demanded that she drink bleach to kill the unborn child allegedly and held her at knife point as she walked to her car and threatened to stab her in the stomach as she yelled for help. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3959.52s)]
*  There's a lot of different occasions that she alleges in here. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3971.52s)]
*  But if y'all look at this boy, he looks like he does all that. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3973.52s)]
*  Like this is what I'm saying. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3977.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3978.52s)]
*  He looks like he eats like bath salt. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3979.52s)]
*  Like he look like that. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3982.52s)]
*  He look like that. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3983.52s)]
*  He look like he need to go back in the oven. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3984.52s)]
*  Yes! [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3986.52s)]
*  That's pancake batter. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3988.52s)]
*  He's crazy. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3989.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3990.52s)]
*  He just like he looks crazy. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3991.52s)]
*  Like he just put the pancake batter on the girl and it started to bubble. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3992.52s)]
*  This is not the first time that we've heard that he's been this violent person toward her. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=3995.52s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4001.52s)]
*  You got to be careful who you procreate with. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4002.52s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4003.52s)]
*  You remember the text Charlamagne. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4004.52s)]
*  What text? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4006.52s)]
*  What you say? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4007.52s)]
*  This has nothing to do with you Lauren LaRosa. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4008.52s)]
*  Praise God for Scott Jackson and my baby. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4011.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4012.52s)]
*  That's for her. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4013.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4014.52s)]
*  That's unfortunate. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4015.52s)]
*  That's alright though. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4016.52s)]
*  You got to watch who you procreate with. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4017.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4018.52s)]
*  It's a fire concept. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4019.52s)]
*  People be treating, breathing like they in the back of a moving truck rolling dice. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4020.52s)]
*  Oh you did that for rolling dice. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4025.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4027.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4028.52s)]
*  Got you. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4029.52s)]
*  Happy birthday Busta Rhymes. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4030.52s)]
*  Oh! [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4031.52s)]
*  Drop on the Cousin Busta Busta Bus. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4032.52s)]
*  Yes! [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4033.52s)]
*  Happy birthday Busta Bus. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4034.52s)]
*  You seeing that with your hair like that is really funny. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4035.52s)]
*  You got any music from Busta? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4038.52s)]
*  We got some. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4041.52s)]
*  We'll pull it up a little bit. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4042.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4043.52s)]
*  Donkey today. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4044.52s)]
*  Man, four after the hour man. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4045.52s)]
*  Let's talk about accountability. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4046.52s)]
*  People don't have none anymore but there's a mortuary in California, Harrison Ross Mortuary. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4048.52s)]
*  They need to come to the front of the congregation. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4052.52s)]
*  We would like to have a word with them. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4054.52s)]
*  Alright, we'll get to that next at the Breakfast Club. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4055.52s)]
*  Good morning. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4057.52s)]
*  Wake up. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4058.52s)]
*  Wake up. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4059.52s)]
*  You're locked into the Breakfast Club. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4060.52s)]
*  I just wanted to know how you came up with the Donkey of the Day. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4061.52s)]
*  Tell us! [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4064.52s)]
*  Tell us baby! [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4065.52s)]
*  Because you're mean. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4066.52s)]
*  I am not! [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4067.52s)]
*  What did I do? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4068.52s)]
*  I made Donkey of the Day. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4069.52s)]
*  There's a bunch of donkeys out here. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4070.52s)]
*  That is why Charlamagne is here. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4072.52s)]
*  We live a life where we bite our tongue based off who we lay off things. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4075.52s)]
*  We never will say anything. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4078.52s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4084.52s)]
*  In the words of Charlamagne the guy, he's a donkey. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4086.52s)]
*  He ain't my ****. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4088.52s)]
*  Oh man, Charlamagne, you giving Donkey of the Day the who now? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4092.52s)]
*  Happy Born Day Busta. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4096.52s)]
*  Bust Donkey of the Day for Tuesday, May 20th goes to the Harrison Ross Mortuary in California. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4097.52s)]
*  Now first of all, I want to send condolences to Amintha Hunt and the family of 80 year old Otis Atkinson. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4102.52s)]
*  You know I'm not a funeral guy. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4109.52s)]
*  I'm not going to my own funeral if I can help it, but I understand the process of the service. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4111.52s)]
*  It is very important to lay your people to rest with class and dignity. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4116.52s)]
*  But in order to do that, you need a mortuary that moves with class and dignity. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4119.52s)]
*  That's the scary thing, right? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4124.52s)]
*  You know how I talk to you all about schools and how we drop our kids off to schools and trust these teachers [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4125.52s)]
*  with our precious seeds, our souls outside of our bodies, our kids. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4131.52s)]
*  It's the same thing with a mortuary. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4135.52s)]
*  Okay, I know the spirit has left the body, but the body is still precious. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4137.52s)]
*  That's your loved one. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4140.52s)]
*  You want to make sure they are being treated correctly. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4141.52s)]
*  Well, the family of Otis Atkinson, they weren't treated correctly at all. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4143.52s)]
*  They weren't treated with any respect by the Harrison Mortuary. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4147.52s)]
*  Let's go to CBS 3 for the report, please. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4151.52s)]
*  I didn't make arrangements with them to see the wrong body. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4153.52s)]
*  When Amintha Hunt's 80 year old uncle passed away, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4155.52s)]
*  she chose Harrison Ross Mortuary to prepare him for burial. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4158.52s)]
*  But when she went to view his body, she says it wasn't him. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4161.52s)]
*  It was a guy laying there in my uncle's suit, but it wasn't my uncle. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4164.52s)]
*  What did you think? [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4169.52s)]
*  I just kept looking at him. I didn't know. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4170.52s)]
*  I just kept looking at him and kept looking at him. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4172.52s)]
*  I'm like, what? He couldn't have got that dart. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4174.52s)]
*  Hunt says she knew something was wrong and asked a worker at the mortuary for help. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4176.52s)]
*  She was like, no, yes, that's your uncle. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4179.52s)]
*  I said, that's not my uncle. My uncle wouldn't have got that dart. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4181.52s)]
*  And I said, here's a picture of him. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4184.52s)]
*  And I showed her the picture and she was like, you're right. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4186.52s)]
*  Give us one minute, one minute. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4188.52s)]
*  Hunt says she and her family waited three hours while the mortuary fixed the mix-up [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4190.52s)]
*  so they could finally bury her uncle. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4194.52s)]
*  She still doesn't know whose body was dressed in his suit [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4196.52s)]
*  and has filed a lawsuit against the mortuary over the whole ordeal. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4199.52s)]
*  Her attorney calls the mortuary's actions outrageous. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4203.52s)]
*  For them to come in and see the wrong corpse [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4206.52s)]
*  and then for the mortuary to deny that it's the wrong corpse [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4208.52s)]
*  and then need proof that it's in fact the right person. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4211.52s)]
*  So we think it's really just the basic standard of care that they messed up on. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4215.52s)]
*  Ain't nobody came to see you, Otis. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4220.52s)]
*  First of all, that's not even Otis. Okay? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4222.52s)]
*  We did come to see him, but once again, that's not him. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4224.52s)]
*  I don't know the race of the people who run this funeral home, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4227.52s)]
*  but clearly they believe all black people look alike. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4230.52s)]
*  And what really grinds my gears about this story is the fact [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4233.52s)]
*  that when I'm telling you it's not my uncle, you're trying to tell me it is. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4237.52s)]
*  Okay? I ask a simple question often. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4242.52s)]
*  Okay? This is my question that I ask. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4246.52s)]
*  What do people hate more in this era? [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4248.52s)]
*  Reading or accountability? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4251.52s)]
*  I want you all to think about that for a second. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4253.52s)]
*  What do people hate more? Reading or accountability? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4255.52s)]
*  When the family asked the mortuary worker for help, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4257.52s)]
*  the employee insisted that the stranger in the casket was indeed their uncle. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4260.52s)]
*  And this is why sometimes you have to keep a lawyer on retainer [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4266.52s)]
*  because every now and then violence is justified. Okay? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4269.52s)]
*  I'm trying to explain to you this isn't my uncle, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4272.52s)]
*  but you insisting that it is, and you have the nerve to put this person, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4274.52s)]
*  I don't know, in my uncle's suit? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4278.52s)]
*  Now I got to make you explain to me why we shouldn't squabble. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4281.52s)]
*  Okay? I'm glad we already at the morgue [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4284.52s)]
*  because this was going to be your next stop anyway. All right? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4286.52s)]
*  This level of gaslighting, people not being able to admit when they wrong, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4289.52s)]
*  making two plus two equal five. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4292.52s)]
*  You walk into the mortuary, see a strange man in the casket [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4294.52s)]
*  wearing your uncle's suit. You tell the guy working at the morgue, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4297.52s)]
*  that's not my uncle. And they basically tell you, well, he's also dead. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4300.52s)]
*  So it's essentially the same thing. That is the era we are in folks. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4303.52s)]
*  Okay? People just make false equivalencies all the time. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4308.52s)]
*  The funeral home's response was basically, who are you going to believe? [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4311.52s)]
*  Us are your own eyes. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4314.52s)]
*  That is truly our corporate media landscape too. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4316.52s)]
*  That's what they do to us every day. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4319.52s)]
*  They tell the people believe us, not your own eyes. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4321.52s)]
*  Imagine being in a funeral home and they say to you, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4325.52s)]
*  we can't find your relative, but we do have someone about the same vibe. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4328.52s)]
*  I guarantee you, they tried to blame this on death swelling. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4333.52s)]
*  Death swelling will have you looking a little different, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4336.52s)]
*  but we all know our people. Okay? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4338.52s)]
*  How are you going to tell me that's not my uncle? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4340.52s)]
*  The man was 80. We know him our whole life. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4342.52s)]
*  Sunday dinners, fish fries, Dan Calley. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4344.52s)]
*  Today was playing dominoes. I know home team. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4346.52s)]
*  When I see it, this man in the casket looks like he plays for a rival team [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4349.52s)]
*  in a different sport. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4352.52s)]
*  You can't just put a whole stranger in my uncle Steve Harvey suit [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4354.52s)]
*  and think we won't notice. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4358.52s)]
*  What in the Freaky Friday? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4360.52s)]
*  Listen, the moral of the story is, in life, personal and business, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4362.52s)]
*  you should be humble enough to see your mistakes, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4366.52s)]
*  courageous enough to admit your mistakes, and wise enough to correct them. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4369.52s)]
*  Harrison Ross Mortuary in California was none of those things, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4373.52s)]
*  so please, give them the sweet sounds of the Hamilton's. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4376.52s)]
*  Oh, now you are the donkey of the day. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4379.52s)]
*  You are the donkey of the day. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4386.52s)]
*  And does the stranger that they had in Uncle Otis's suit, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4393.52s)]
*  what about his family? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4400.52s)]
*  Does his family know that they just had him in a whole other suit? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4402.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Who looking for him? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4406.52s)]
*  That's what I mean. Come on, man. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4409.52s)]
*  Yes, this is your uncle. This is him. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4412.52s)]
*  And then she pulled the bitch out and he was like, oh no, one minute. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4415.52s)]
*  Hold on, you fixed this guy. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4418.52s)]
*  He was crazy. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4420.52s)]
*  Jesus. All right. Well, thank you for that donkey today. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4422.52s)]
*  Now, when we come back, the mayor of Newark, Ross Barack, will be joining us. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4425.52s)]
*  We're going to talk to him next. So don't go anywhere. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4428.52s)]
*  It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4430.52s)]
*  The Breakfast Club. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4432.52s)]
*  Morning, everybody. It's DJ NV, Jess Hilarious, Charlamagne the Guy. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4435.52s)]
*  We are The Breakfast Club. We got a special guest in the building. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4440.52s)]
*  Yes, indeed. We got Mayor Ross Barack. Welcome. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4443.52s)]
*  How you feeling, brother? I'm good. I'm good. A little tired, but I'm good. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4445.52s)]
*  You can't get tired now? I know that's right. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4448.52s)]
*  You got a long way to go. I know that's right. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4450.52s)]
*  How are you, man? I'm good, man. Yeah, yeah. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4452.52s)]
*  Had a rough couple of weeks, but I'm all right. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4455.52s)]
*  You care to elaborate on that? [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4457.52s)]
*  Just like the specific circumstances that led to the arrest at Delaney Hall? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4459.52s)]
*  Yeah. You know, we've been going down there every day. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4463.52s)]
*  In fact, my folks are down there now to do the inspections, uniform cold construction. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4466.52s)]
*  You know, you have to get a certificate of occupancy, all these other things. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4472.52s)]
*  But they came in and just was like, you know, we're going to do what we want to do. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4476.52s)]
*  Our folks went down there. They wouldn't let them in. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4479.52s)]
*  I was surprised. So I had them go with y'all. I wanted to see what was going on. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4481.52s)]
*  So they wouldn't let y'all in to do the inspections? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4484.52s)]
*  Yeah. So they basically was like, no, Gio, this is a private company. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4486.52s)]
*  This is not the government, not ICE, nobody, just these guys. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4490.52s)]
*  And so we took them to court and we're in the process of being in court. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4493.52s)]
*  And they just start putting detainees in the building while we were in court, like just total disrespect. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4497.52s)]
*  So we go out every morning to serve them, like give them a citation, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4502.52s)]
*  because we just want to show a pattern that they have been disregarding the local law when we get in court. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4506.52s)]
*  The congress people went down there to do a walkthrough, and they called me and was like, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4512.52s)]
*  yo, we having a press conference. We want you to be at the press conference. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4515.52s)]
*  I said, cool. So I came down to the press conference. It was protesters outside. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4519.52s)]
*  They out there every day, by the way, saying, let the mayor in. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4523.52s)]
*  That's what they were saying when I was at the gate. So the guy lets me in. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4526.52s)]
*  The guard, he was like, come on this side of the gate. So I did. I stood there about an hour and a half. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4528.52s)]
*  And then the special agent in charge of Homeland Security came. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4533.52s)]
*  But ICE was already there. They didn't say anything to me. I was there for like an hour. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4537.52s)]
*  They just looked at me, looking at them. He came, approached me. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4541.52s)]
*  Start talking crazy, reckless. The congress people got in it. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4544.52s)]
*  He said, you know, he's going to arrest me. Then the congresswoman was like, no. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4548.52s)]
*  I said, you know what? I'm leaving. Don't worry about it. He said, yeah, get out. So I left. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4552.52s)]
*  I left and went on the other side of the fence. He got a phone call. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4555.52s)]
*  They made a decision to leave the inside and come on the outside and arrest me on the city side. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4559.52s)]
*  You know, and that's basically what happened. They took me to a real lockup somewhere, [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4563.52s)]
*  some place I didn't even know existed in Newark, by the way. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4567.52s)]
*  In a cell, took pictures, fingerprints, charged me with federal trespass, went to a hearing, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4571.52s)]
*  the whole thing, you know, fingerprinting me again. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4578.52s)]
*  I heard that. I heard you were subjected to like a second round of fingerprinting and mugshots. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4581.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4584.52s)]
*  Why? How do you interpret that? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4585.52s)]
*  I have no idea, man. They was like, one agency has it, not the other agency. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4587.52s)]
*  I was like, can't y'all get it from them? Like, it's technology. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4591.52s)]
*  I mean, they did this in the middle of the court. Like, we were leaving. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4593.52s)]
*  The marshals came into the courtroom to escort me out and my lawyer started going back and forth with them. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4596.52s)]
*  I just said, you know what? Forget it. Just take me wherever y'all got to wherever y'all going. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4603.52s)]
*  I'm going. Let's go. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4606.52s)]
*  They took you to a place you didn't even know existed. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4607.52s)]
*  The first time. Yeah, absolutely. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4609.52s)]
*  Wow. Like some nondescript factory looking place. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4611.52s)]
*  Took me down in the basement. There's like real cells in there. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4615.52s)]
*  What? Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4618.52s)]
*  And you didn't know it was there? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4620.52s)]
*  No, not at all. No, it's a Homeland Security spot that they have there. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4621.52s)]
*  Wow. Did you see other people detained there as well? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4626.52s)]
*  No, I didn't see anybody. They had me, you know, off somewhere. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4628.52s)]
*  You know, so I didn't know what was going on down there. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4632.52s)]
*  Do you think any of your criticism of Trump caused them to act like that? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4634.52s)]
*  Well, I just believe that they wanted to get the mayor of the city. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4639.52s)]
*  You know, they want this, I'm going to arrest judges, mayors, whoever's like there in charge. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4643.52s)]
*  You just want to show that we have power and authority and you're not going to defy us. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4648.52s)]
*  I mean, we're going to get whoever it is. You can get it too type of thing. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4653.52s)]
*  Right. So I think that's what it was. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4656.52s)]
*  And when they realized I was there, somebody sent them there to get me, you know. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4658.52s)]
*  So that's basically what happened. I don't even think it's directly about me. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4662.52s)]
*  I think it's about them and them trying to prove to everybody that they're untouchable. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4665.52s)]
*  And they basically do what they want to do. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4669.52s)]
*  When they realized it was me, they sent a special agent in charge of the Homeland Security investigation of that region to come and get me. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4671.52s)]
*  That's like the police director going downtown and arresting somebody for shoplifting. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4677.52s)]
*  You know, so he comes by himself and does that. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4681.52s)]
*  So what's inside this building? Has anybody seen what they're doing in this building? Nobody knows. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4684.52s)]
*  I mean, CBS was a granted entry and they gave him like a limited tour. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4688.52s)]
*  And they keep saying it's like these criminals in there, murderers, you know, the Republican talking point. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4692.52s)]
*  But nobody knows who's in there. You don't know what's going on, who they are, where they come from. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4698.52s)]
*  We don't know anything. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4702.52s)]
*  And the building was used as a halfway house and a drug rehab 20 years ago to change the use of the building. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4703.52s)]
*  Now you're going to change it to a place with detainees. You have to get that checked, right? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4710.52s)]
*  It has to be you have to get a certificate of occupancy. You have to apply for that. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4715.52s)]
*  You have to get inspections. You may have to go to the planning board, zoning board. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4718.52s)]
*  It depends. But you have to start that process. Anybody has to do that. It's not special. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4721.52s)]
*  It's not like putting undue circumstances on these people. This is what everybody goes through. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4726.52s)]
*  I saw you say that you feel like these measures were an attempt to humiliate and degrade you. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4732.52s)]
*  Absolutely. Once they cuffed me, threw me in a car, you know, the security that the police did was pretty decent. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4736.52s)]
*  But, you know, taking me through that process, they put me in a cell, you know, the whole fingerprint and the interrogation piece. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4744.52s)]
*  You know, then doing it again. I just don't think it's necessary. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4751.52s)]
*  I mean, the U.S. attorney came to my hearing. It's a Class C misdemeanor, $400 fine, maximum 30 days of jail. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4755.52s)]
*  She's at the hearing, the U.S. attorney. I'm like, what's happening here? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4763.52s)]
*  Have you gotten any messages behind the scenes on some like, all right, don't step out of line again. It can get worse or something. You know what I mean? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4767.52s)]
*  Pretty much. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4775.52s)]
*  From who though? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4776.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, we were in the process of trying to figure out the charges and that, you know, and these people are, you know, they serious. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4779.52s)]
*  They committed to their foolishness. You know what I mean? They threatened to arrest the congresswoman who was there and multiple congresswomen. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4787.52s)]
*  You know, they threatened to take us through this all the way to the end. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4793.52s)]
*  But, you know, at the end of the day, like we didn't do anything wrong. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4797.52s)]
*  So, I mean, if they want to waste the taxpayers' money, the government's money to go through this, then let's go through it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4801.52s)]
*  We think we are correct and I don't think they have any ground to stand on. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4807.52s)]
*  What do you say to people who say they don't care about fighting for the rights of immigrants? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4812.52s)]
*  They're just misinformed and because we've allowed other people to kind of dictate or control the narrative. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4817.52s)]
*  Honestly, what we're fighting for is the due process for the 14th Amendment, the Fourth and Fifth Amendment to be securing your person, your papers, your property. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4825.52s)]
*  People can't do anything to you, pull you over, throw you in jail without due process, without you going to court, without them having a warrant, all these specific things. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4834.52s)]
*  And I think more than anybody, black people should be concerned about that because we are the number one victims of being searched without probable cause. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4843.52s)]
*  People coming to our property, our persons, disregarding our constitutional rights, the first, the Bill of Rights, the disregard for that. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4852.52s)]
*  We should be the first ones concerned about it. So we should stand up for people who are getting theirs violated because we next. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4862.52s)]
*  And I see that you also run for governor as well. Do you feel like this is a part of the plan to mess that up too? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4868.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think it's the part of the plan to mess everything up, you know. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4874.52s)]
*  So I think what they meant for evil, though, always turns to good. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4878.52s)]
*  I mean, these people are not thinking about what they're doing and just reacting, right? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4882.52s)]
*  The person in charge of Homeland Security, well, the second in charge gets on TV, starts saying we stormed the place. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4888.52s)]
*  It was a bus of migrants going in there. You know, we slammed ICE agents. Like all this was fabrication. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4895.52s)]
*  Now they just put themselves in a bad situation because now you're saying things that are not true because we have the videos. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4902.52s)]
*  So I just start dropping the videos so people can see that I walked in there with my hands in my pocket, you know, very calm, you know, because the guy opened the gate and let us in. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4908.52s)]
*  There was no kicking, no shoving, no pushing. I mean, they're used to lying and controlling the narrative. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4917.52s)]
*  But this is the time they made a very grave mistake. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4922.52s)]
*  Do you think that this will impact your bid for governor in any way? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4925.52s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I mean, people who don't like what happened don't like what happened anyway. They don't like they wouldn't vote for me anyway. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4928.52s)]
*  So I don't think I'm going to lose any votes based on what we did. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4936.52s)]
*  I think what it does do though is it tells people that we willing to go all the way that, you know, we're not just talking about defending people's rights that we're going to challenge these people at every turn. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4940.52s)]
*  We're still kicking in with the mayor of Newark, Ross Baraka. Shalameh? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4951.52s)]
*  Newark Airport, man. What the hell is going on Mayor Baraka? Like what is the problem with Newark Airport? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4955.52s)]
*  How did they get here to where people are saying it's unsafe to fly out of Newark Airport? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4960.52s)]
*  They say don't fly out of Newark. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4964.52s)]
*  I don't think it's unsafe. I don't think it's unsafe because they keep delaying and canceling flights. If they weren't doing that, then it would be unsafe. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4967.52s)]
*  The reality is there's too many planes in the airspace. Air traffic controllers is not enough. Our air traffic controllers walked off because of stress. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4974.52s)]
*  They don't want to when they lose in contact with airplanes, they don't want to be the one responsible for 90 people, 150 people going down. So they're walking away. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4982.52s)]
*  The radar system in that area doesn't work. The infrastructure is broke. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4992.52s)]
*  But the Trump administration came in, got rid of 400 people, blamed DEI, and now they realize it's a real problem and none of that is going to help it. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=4996.52s)]
*  So now they're trying to put money in infrastructure and hire more air traffic controllers. But they need to do that rapidly, like in an emergency. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5004.52s)]
*  And in the meantime, we just need to slow those flights down. We need to do the same kind of patterns that happened out in LaGuardia. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5011.52s)]
*  See, LaGuardia is in the same airspace but not having this problem. They're not having this problem because they have less flights and they have more time between flights. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5017.52s)]
*  The flights coming in and the flights going is more space between those. We just fly places, fly in and out, in and out, in and out. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5024.52s)]
*  We're acting like there is no problem. But there is a problem. And so as we act like there's no problem, they're canceling flights and delaying flights. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5031.52s)]
*  And ultimately, they just need to not have those flights until they get this in order. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5040.52s)]
*  So you said people, they were walking off why? Because they just were stressed out? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5044.52s)]
*  Yeah, they... [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5048.52s)]
*  What were they stressed out about? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5049.52s)]
*  I mean, to not have contact with an airplane for 30 seconds, for 60 seconds, for 90 seconds is a lot. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5051.52s)]
*  I mean, if you're an air traffic controller and you can't control what's going on and somebody crashes and dies on your watch, I mean, obviously that's going to cause a bit of stress. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5057.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5066.52s)]
*  And Newark is unfortunately at insult to injury there, you know, fixing one of the runways at the same time. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5068.52s)]
*  So that should be done prayerfully by the end of June. But we need more air traffic controllers and we need the infrastructure fixed immediately. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5075.52s)]
*  We need emergency spending, emergency funding to get that stuff done like yesterday. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5082.52s)]
*  But nobody knew that about the infrastructure beforehand? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5086.52s)]
*  Of course they did. They knew that the infrastructure was old. They also knew that we didn't have enough air traffic controllers. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5088.52s)]
*  Not just Newark, but period. That's why we were having incidents. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5095.52s)]
*  When the Trump administration first came in, you seen all these airline issues that were going on, which signaled that there was a problem. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5098.52s)]
*  And instead of dealing with the problem, they began blaming DEI and continue to lay people off instead of hiring people, fixing the infrastructure. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5105.52s)]
*  So we won't have this emergency situation where we are now. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5113.52s)]
*  So finally they've understood that this is a real problem. So now they're trying to address it, but it's not happening fast enough. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5117.52s)]
*  But in the meantime, I would say they need to stop some of these planes from going off the ground. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5124.52s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to be inconvenienced because you can't get as many flights as you could have got before. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5129.52s)]
*  But safety is more important than anything else, I would say. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5133.52s)]
*  I wanted to ask about the congresswoman that is also going against you in this race. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5136.52s)]
*  They said that she has supported a lot of the things that Donald Trump has put to the table and you've been very vocal about that. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5140.52s)]
*  What are your thoughts on some of the things that she's trying to follow up with and that she's campaigning for? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5148.52s)]
*  Well, you know, everybody in the primary now is progressive, right? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5152.52s)]
*  But all of the progressive leaning organizations endorse my candidacy. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5157.52s)]
*  All of the progressive unions, all of the progressive organizations. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5161.52s)]
*  For People's Organization Progress, 32BJ, Working Families. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5164.52s)]
*  Because I'm a real progressive, I'm not just playing one on TV. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5167.52s)]
*  The reality is, here's a woman who supported the border wall, right? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5170.52s)]
*  Who, you know, supported $4 billion to go towards Trump's border wall, right? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5175.52s)]
*  A person that voted against immigrants while she was the congressperson, right? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5179.52s)]
*  Who is opposed to the Immigrant Trust Act in New Jersey. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5184.52s)]
*  Who says that we have to not ask people their status, that our police can't cooperate with ICE. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5187.52s)]
*  That we have to make sure immigrants get the same services as any other people or residents of the state of New Jersey. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5194.52s)]
*  She is opposed to that and voted against things when she was the congressperson. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5201.52s)]
*  So the reality is, I don't think that she's progressive at all. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5205.52s)]
*  So she's actually supposed to be coming up here, I think, this week. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5209.52s)]
*  What's one question that you would think is the most important question that she should answer? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5211.52s)]
*  That, what's her plan for black and brown people? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5215.52s)]
*  But more importantly, black women, right? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5218.52s)]
*  Black women are the most committed and dedicated constituent that the Democratic Party has. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5221.52s)]
*  And they're treated the worst in New Jersey or in this country. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5225.52s)]
*  I mean, she's endorsed by the mainstream Democratic Party, but they have no plan for black people. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5229.52s)]
*  They never did. They have no plan for Latinos. They never did. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5235.52s)]
*  And they have no plan for working people. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5238.52s)]
*  I mean, the Democratic Party is in charge of the state and working people are struggling the most. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5240.52s)]
*  We can't pay our bills. Our childcare is too high, right? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5244.52s)]
*  Insurance is too high. In fact, if you got the wrong credit score, you might not get no insurance, right? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5248.52s)]
*  Your rent is too high. Your mortgage is too high. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5252.52s)]
*  And we still give tax breaks to billionaires in New Jersey and can't take care of working people. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5255.52s)]
*  And you're supposed to be the party of working families, right? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5261.52s)]
*  She should have an answer for those things. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5263.52s)]
*  Is running for governor hard when you still got to govern as mayor? [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5266.52s)]
*  And the reason I brought that up is because everybody, well, not everybody, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5270.52s)]
*  but there were people saying that this was a publicity stunt when you got arrested. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5274.52s)]
*  Like you're just trying to drum up, you know, attention for your campaign for governor. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5277.52s)]
*  I got a lot of ways to drum up attention. Going to jail ain't one of them, you know? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5281.52s)]
*  But ultimately, like, look, I just came from the gym that day. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5285.52s)]
*  You know, I was going to get a shake to go back to the office. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5289.52s)]
*  My policy advisor reminded me that they were having a press conference. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5292.52s)]
*  I went down there for that press conference to support my congresspeople. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5295.52s)]
*  I didn't expect that they would do that. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5299.52s)]
*  And honestly, you know, when they started threatening, I thought they was bluffing. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5301.52s)]
*  Like when I left the property, if I wanted to get arrested, I would have stayed on the property. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5306.52s)]
*  I actually left, right? And 20 years ago, I would have took flight, you know, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5309.52s)]
*  when they said they're coming to arrest you. I would have been fences, cars, everything, you know? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5313.52s)]
*  The reality of the matter is nowhere for me to go. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5317.52s)]
*  Like if they're going to arrest you, where am I going to go? They're going to come. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5319.52s)]
*  Like, so if you're going to do it, just do it now. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5322.52s)]
*  And that's really what my sentiment was. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5324.52s)]
*  Like I don't believe you got it in you that this is not going to happen. This can't happen. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5326.52s)]
*  When the congressman told me they're coming to arrest you, I said, why? What did I do? I didn't do anything. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5330.52s)]
*  That's exactly what my response was. What did I do? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5334.52s)]
*  I was like, oh, come arrest me. I didn't do anything. How are you going to arrest me? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5337.52s)]
*  I'm not even on your property anymore. And they came out and did it anyway. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5341.52s)]
*  At any point, were you like afraid for your life, the fact that you were taken to an offsite factory? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5345.52s)]
*  You ain't never seen before? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5351.52s)]
*  Yeah, like what was going through your mind? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5352.52s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, I guess when you, I'm a grown man now with family, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5354.52s)]
*  so when you get arrested, all kinds of things going through your head, who picked my children up from school, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5358.52s)]
*  like I got a meeting tonight, you know, all kinds of stuff. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5361.52s)]
*  And you was hungry, you didn't even get your shake? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5364.52s)]
*  That's right. Did I leave my house door open? All kinds of stuff is going through your head, like, you know, really fast. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5366.52s)]
*  And they taking you somewhere you don't know. Fear gets in your heart and you just pray that, you know, fear don't turn you into a coward. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5373.52s)]
*  Well, we appreciate you for joining us and I'm sure, you know, you'll be back up here before the race actually happens. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5380.52s)]
*  What date is that? June 10th. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5386.52s)]
*  June 10th. That's right. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5389.52s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Mayor Ross Baraka. It's The Breakfast Club. Good morning. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5391.52s)]
*  The Breakfast Club. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5395.52s)]

*  OK, guys, guess what? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5426.52s)]
*  What? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5429.52s)]
*  Sesame Street is coming to Netflix. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5430.52s)]
*  That's what's up. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5432.52s)]
*  That's dope because they got all their funding cut, right? Didn't people get their funding cut? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5433.52s)]
*  Who's in Netflix? That was smart. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5437.52s)]
*  Yep. So Trump signed in. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5438.52s)]
*  I thought you were going to say something else. Go ahead. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5440.52s)]
*  What did you think I was going to say? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5442.52s)]
*  I don't know. Just something other than Sesame Street is coming to Netflix. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5443.52s)]
*  Netflix. Go ahead. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5446.52s)]
*  That's a big deal, though. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5447.52s)]
*  People are excited and it is a big deal because of what Sesame Street represents and how, you know, the origin of Sesame Street had been for underprivileged children, for them to learn and explore things. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5448.52s)]
*  And Trump signed that executive order where he cut the funding for like the PBSs and things of that nature where Netflix is going to have, I mean, not Netflix. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5457.52s)]
*  Sesame Street wasn't going to be as supported to a certain extent because a percentage of their money comes from the federal funding. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5464.52s)]
*  But Netflix came in and said, nope, not happening. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5470.52s)]
*  So Sesame Street posted, we are excited to announce that all that all new Sesame Street is coming to Netflix worldwide, along with library episodes and new episodes. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5472.52s)]
*  And they'll also premiere the same day on PBS stations and PBS Kids platforms in the U.S. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5482.52s)]
*  It's going to preserve a 50 plus year relationship. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5487.52s)]
*  So the support with Netflix, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting serve as a unique public private partnership to enable Sesame Street to continue to help children everywhere. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5490.52s)]
*  It's actually better for Sesame Street for them to be on Netflix. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5500.52s)]
*  Yeah, because, you know, it's mad people that watch Netflix nowadays. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5504.52s)]
*  I mean, don't get me wrong, PBS is still PBS, but I don't think PBS got the power. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5506.52s)]
*  My kids don't be on PBS. My kids have their own Netflix account, but they can watch Netflix Kids. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5510.52s)]
*  So Sesame Street be having dope guests on there that people don't even be paying attention to. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5515.52s)]
*  Chris Brown was on there. Chris Brown was on there. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5520.52s)]
*  Cizzle was on there. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5522.52s)]
*  I don't know if Chris Brown will be back on there, but yeah, he's on there. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5524.52s)]
*  But there were some people that brought up the fact that, you know, you do have to pay for Netflix and some of the homes that Sesame Street targets may not be able to pay for that. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5528.52s)]
*  They are still going to be releasing some things on their YouTube channel as well to Sesame Street. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5536.52s)]
*  But if you are watching the episodes on Netflix, you get to get an 11 minute story, which now allows for even more character driven humor and heart. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5540.52s)]
*  So it makes it a bit longer. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5548.52s)]
*  So yeah, shout out to Sesame Street. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5550.52s)]
*  And Elmo posted on LinkedIn when the executive order dropped that Trump sign that he was looking for a new job. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5551.52s)]
*  So he good now. Elmo was good. For anybody that was wondering. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5556.52s)]
*  That's what's up, Elmo. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5559.52s)]
*  He was. He was looking for a new job. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5561.52s)]

*  You can't really hear it, but you see the guy grab him and he's like... [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5736.52s)]
*  Get your hands off me. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5739.52s)]
*  Yeah, like whatever. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5740.52s)]
*  He's not able to grab nobody. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5741.52s)]
*  Yeah, he was on the red carpet for the May 19th premiere of his film, Highest of Lowest. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5742.52s)]
*  So that's what's up. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5747.52s)]
*  All them brothers looked good on that carpet yesterday. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5749.52s)]
*  They did. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5751.52s)]
*  The Zell suit was tailored. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5752.52s)]
*  ASAP suit was tailored. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5753.52s)]
*  Like they look very fly. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5754.52s)]
*  I'd love to see it. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5756.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5757.52s)]
*  I did want to say that I'm back in court today and today they're going to go back into a [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5758.52s)]
*  testimony by one of Diddy's previous personal assistants. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5764.52s)]
*  It's a white guy. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5768.52s)]
*  He's a prosecutor, David. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5770.52s)]
*  And the minute he took the stand, he was very emotional. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5771.52s)]
*  And I'm like, this is going to be a very compelling testimony because it seems like he feels like [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5775.52s)]
*  he got to get some things off of his chest. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5779.52s)]
*  So I'm actually... [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5781.52s)]
*  He's a prosecution's witness, right? [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5782.52s)]
*  He's a prosecution's witness. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5783.52s)]
*  And they've already established a part of the Rico you keep mentioning with him where [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5784.52s)]
*  he talks about just how hard he was working. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5788.52s)]
*  He said that he was working almost seven days a week sometimes, six days a week, 20 plus [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5791.52s)]
*  hours a day, was making 70K a year. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5797.52s)]
*  And he said... [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5800.52s)]
*  Everybody in the courtroom said that too when they asked him how much he was making. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5801.52s)]
*  And he said that he went through what his day was like. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5805.52s)]
*  He was like... [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5808.52s)]
*  The first part of his day was he had to wake up before Diddy and he would have to set the [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5809.52s)]
*  mood that Diddy wakes up to. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5814.52s)]
*  So what the food is going to be like, what music or what TV he's watching. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5815.52s)]
*  And I'm like, dang, to have somebody check back and call like that all day long, before [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5819.52s)]
*  he wakes up to five o'clock in the morning. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5825.52s)]
*  That's rich rich. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5827.52s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5828.52s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5829.52s)]
*  The crazy part is this is just week two. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5830.52s)]
*  Did he talk about he had to set up the freak offs or no? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5832.52s)]
*  He hasn't. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5836.52s)]
*  So he did say that he had to... [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5837.52s)]
*  Setting the mood sounds very cool. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5839.52s)]
*  Everything about Diddy is very energy driven. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5842.52s)]
*  But he did say that he had to go in advanced locations. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5845.52s)]
*  So he would go to different shows and things of that nature to make sure that things were [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5849.52s)]
*  set the way that Diddy liked it. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5853.52s)]
*  So he had a lot of different writers for different places. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5854.52s)]
*  They did briefly mention hotel rooms, but they didn't get into that yet. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5857.52s)]
*  But one of the things he also talked about too was he had had some conversations. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5860.52s)]
*  He said he had two conversations with Cassie ever. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5863.52s)]
*  One of them was about how crazy she thought the lifestyle was allegedly. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5866.52s)]
*  And he was like, well, why don't you just get out? [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5869.52s)]
*  And she was telling him, you know, she alleged that like Diddy controlled everything, paid [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5871.52s)]
*  for her apartment, her car, her everything. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5875.52s)]
*  So she didn't really understand. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5877.52s)]
*  So I think he's going to give a lot of insight into some things that we've been hearing as [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5878.52s)]
*  well too from a person that's like completely unattached. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5882.52s)]
*  He wasn't making it completely unattached. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5884.52s)]
*  So yeah, listen. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5886.52s)]
*  All right. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5888.52s)]
*  I just want to say, but you know, before you go, because I know you got to get to court. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5889.52s)]
*  It is a video that I saw yesterday. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5892.52s)]
*  It was very disturbing. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5894.52s)]
*  I know some people may have seen it, but it was a birthday video. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5895.52s)]
*  Look like, you know, from a couple of years ago. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5899.52s)]
*  And Diddy is like happy. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5901.52s)]
*  He's laying in a bed and he's like, happy birthday to me. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5903.52s)]
*  And a guy is in the back like, oh, and it's like four different times. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5905.52s)]
*  And this is his birthday. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5910.52s)]
*  No, it's a video. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5912.52s)]
*  I was trying to tell you it was the guy was like, ah, ah, like four times. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5914.52s)]
*  And then Diddy look up like, oh, that's just, you know, whatever's happening. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5922.52s)]
*  Like that's normal. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5925.52s)]
*  He these sounds are normal to him. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5926.52s)]
*  And he was just like, went on ahead with the video, like, happy birthday to me. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5928.52s)]
*  And a guy's in the back. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5932.52s)]
*  Oh my gosh, being torn apart and you hear it. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5934.52s)]
*  And he's like, ah, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5936.52s)]
*  I don't know if that guy will be testified. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5939.52s)]
*  Can we find out who that is? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asWMuGVQYMA&t=5942.52s)]
