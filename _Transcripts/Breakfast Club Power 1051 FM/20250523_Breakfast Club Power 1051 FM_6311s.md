*  He just loves it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=66.74s)]
*  So that's the stuff. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=67.58s)]
*  I mean, roots, I know roots in Anguilla is a stretch, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=68.42s)]
*  but I got, you know. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=70.7s)]
*  Very much a stretch. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=71.53999999999999s)]

*  is a nationally syndicated platform. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=81.5s)]

*  You see what I'm saying? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=97.9s)]
*  If y'all don't believe climate change is real, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=98.74s)]

*  It's DJ, Envy, Jess, Hilarious, Charlamagne, the guy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=237.66s)]
*  We are the breakfast club. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=240.70000000000002s)]
*  Let's get in some front page news. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=241.94s)]
*  Start off with sports. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=244.62s)]
*  Now, OKC beat the Timberwolves last night, 118-103. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=245.66s)]
*  They lead that series to nothing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=248.66000000000003s)]
*  Ant-Man, Julius Randall. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=250.82000000000002s)]
*  What y'all gonna do? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=252.10000000000002s)]
*  Y'all gonna make this a series [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=252.94s)]
*  or we just gonna have to sleep [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=253.78s)]
*  through the Western Conference finals? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=254.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=256.98s)]
*  I actually need Minnesota to win. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=257.82s)]
*  Cause I think if the Knicks do win, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=259.90000000000003s)]
*  we have a better shot at beating the Timberwolves in OKC. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=261.82s)]
*  But I gotta beat the Pacers first. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=264.3s)]
*  And then we play the Pacers tonight at 8 p.m. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=266.06s)]
*  So you worried about the wrong things. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=267.94s)]
*  You need to focus on them damn Pacers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=269.42s)]
*  and make sure that the Knicks can beat them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=270.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=272.3s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=273.14s)]
*  What's up Morgan? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=273.98s)]
*  Hey, happy Friday. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=275.98s)]
*  How we feeling? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=277.22s)]
*  We good. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=278.3s)]
*  We good. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=279.14s)]
*  All right, let's get into it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=279.98s)]
*  So first on front page, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=281.14s)]
*  President Trump says lowering the cost of drugs [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=282.38s)]
*  may end up being the most significant thing [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  his administration will do. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=287.5s)]
*  He made the comments speaking [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=289.66s)]
*  at the Make America Healthy event again, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=291.06s)]
*  or Make America Healthy Again event, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=293.62s)]
*  adding that he challenges high drug prices [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=296.1s)]
*  and that will resonate for generations to come. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=299.42s)]
*  Now last week, Trump signed an executive order [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=301.94s)]
*  aimed at slashing prescription drug prices. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=303.98s)]
*  He said the U.S. will no longer foot the bill [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  for lower drug prices in other countries. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=308.9s)]
*  So let's take a listen to President Trump [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=311.1s)]
*  at his Make America Healthy Again event. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=313.02s)]
*  And now they're going down maybe by 85, 80. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=316.9s)]
*  I'm telling you, 89% in two instances, 89% cut. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=319.62s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=324.18s)]
*  We were subsidizing the whole world. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=325.94s)]
*  And I said, we're not gonna do that anymore. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=328.34s)]
*  We've been a laughing stock for so many years. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=329.9s)]
*  The last four years, we've been a laughing stock. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=331.82s)]
*  I said it, we were a laughing stock [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=333.78s)]
*  and now we're the most respected. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=335.38s)]
*  So how's- [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=337.98s)]
*  I'm still confused by this Morgan [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=338.82s)]
*  because the Inflation Reduction Act is already in place. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=340.26s)]
*  Like the Inflation Reduction Act was put in, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=343.58s)]
*  was actual legislation passed by the Biden administration [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  and that lowered prescription drug costs [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=348.53999999999996s)]
*  and made health insurance more affordable. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=351.18s)]
*  And that's actual legislation, not an executive order. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=352.98s)]
*  So what is, what Trump did better than that? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=355.18s)]
*  Oh no, it's not necessarily that it's better, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  but you know, the Republicans don't like [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=360.14s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=361.86s)]
*  and it doesn't necessarily address those overseas costs [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=363.14s)]
*  on certain things. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=367.3s)]
*  Now Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=368.98s)]
*  released his Make America Healthy Again report [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=371.86s)]
*  saying it's a call to action for common sense. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=374.82s)]
*  Now he believes it's a roadmap for federal agencies [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=377.62s)]
*  to use to reduce chronic childhood illness. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=380.62s)]
*  And at the top of the list was poor diet, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=383.02s)]
*  an estimated 70% of US kids' calories [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=385.38s)]
*  coming from ultra processed foods. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=388.18s)]
*  US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rawlins [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=390.46s)]
*  also talked about reforms in food stamps. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=392.94s)]
*  Let's take a listen to their comments. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=395.14s)]
*  Kennedy and Rawlins. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=396.58s)]
*  It's common sense that not all calories [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=398.3s)]
*  are equal in nutritional value. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=400.62s)]
*  It's common sense that over medicating kids is dangerous. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=403.54s)]
*  We are on track to sign multiples of SNAP waivers [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=407.46s)]
*  to get junk food and sugary drinks [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=411.9s)]
*  out of our food stamp system. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=414.46s)]
*  And I am so proud. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=418.06s)]
*  So other points from the MAHA report [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=420.26s)]
*  include too many environmental chemicals in our food, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=422.54s)]
*  lack of activity and chronic stress [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=426.02s)]
*  and the over prescription of medication for kids. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=427.78s)]
*  Of course they're talking about trans [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=431.18s)]
*  things like that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=432.94s)]
*  Kennedy says the US must act decisively [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=434.06s)]
*  to reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=436.82s)]
*  Now in other news, Harvard University [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=439.94s)]
*  can no longer enroll foreign students. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  That's according to Homeland Security, Christy Noam [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  who sent a letter to Harvard informing them [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=446.38s)]
*  that their eligibility or their ability [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=448.74s)]
*  to enroll foreign students at their university [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=450.66s)]
*  has been revoked. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=452.5s)]
*  She says the university has not fully complied [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=453.58s)]
*  with all reporting requirements to DHS, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  including providing detailed records [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=458.42s)]
*  of foreign students' misconduct on campus. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=460.02s)]
*  I'm not gonna toss to her audio, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=463.02s)]
*  but the Trump administration has already yanked [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=463.86s)]
*  millions in federal grants meant for the university. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=465.65999999999997s)]
*  I anticipate seeing more of this [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=468.3s)]
*  with other institutions of higher education [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=471.34s)]
*  who decide to buck back against the Trump administration. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=473.18s)]
*  So we will continue to keep you posted [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=475.74s)]
*  on what happens in these types of situations, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=478.54s)]
*  these types of instances. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=481.38s)]
*  That's your- [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=482.42s)]
*  Is that legal? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=483.26s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, I hear these things [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=484.1s)]
*  and I don't know if they're legal or not. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=484.94s)]
*  It don't sound like that's something you can just do, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=486.38s)]
*  but can you? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=488.82s)]
*  Are you worried about legal with Donald Trump? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=489.86s)]
*  That is true. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=492.58000000000004s)]
*  You keep asking this question every day. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=493.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=494.26s)]
*  I don't know why I do that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=495.1s)]
*  There is no rule of law [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=495.94s)]
*  when it comes to the Trump administration. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=497.06s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=498.46000000000004s)]
*  There you go. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=499.3s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=500.14000000000004s)]

*  All right, so that covers 6 a.m. at 7 a.m. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=501.82s)]
*  We're gonna get some more details on this shooting [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  that happened in Washington, D.C. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=505.46000000000004s)]
*  at the Capital Jewish Museum. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=506.78000000000003s)]

*  I got a theory. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=540.62s)]
*  I think what's going on with Trump [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=541.6999999999999s)]
*  is the fact that everybody in the government [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=543.6999999999999s)]
*  really want him to do what he wants, what he's doing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=546.98s)]
*  I be thinking that too, brother. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  I think the problem is he's doing [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=551.66s)]
*  exactly what the plan is. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=553.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=555.9s)]
*  He's getting things in order when it comes to finances [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=556.7399999999999s)]
*  for the country. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=560.14s)]
*  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not Trump fan, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=562.3399999999999s)]
*  but when I look at all of our constituents, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=564.78s)]
*  Democrats, Republicans, independents, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=568.18s)]
*  everybody's just talking. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  Nobody's really doing anything. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=572.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=573.9799999999999s)]
*  Listen, I agree with you 100%. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=575.42s)]
*  Like, it makes no sense. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=576.9799999999999s)]
*  Like even, you know, when you think about [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=578.58s)]
*  the last four years when Biden was in office, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=580.38s)]
*  they told us how much of a threat that Donald Trump was, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=582.46s)]
*  but they never acted like he was one. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=585.7s)]
*  And then, you know, when he wins [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=587.82s)]
*  and they're just like, welcome home, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=589.74s)]
*  it almost feels like everybody's in cahoots with each other. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=591.82s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=594.82s)]
*  If they weren't, I would feel like it'd be more resistance. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=596.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  You know? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=599.74s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=600.58s)]
*  Now, the other thing, I do want to say this. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=601.5s)]
*  You want to say this, Charlamagne, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=604.1400000000001s)]
*  you ask all the time, what can we do? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=606.1800000000001s)]
*  Every major government in history, for the most part, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=608.62s)]
*  has been overthrown by the people. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=611.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be in the government. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=613.26s)]
*  I think it's going to have to be somebody [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=614.7399999999999s)]
*  that's got to stand up and take a million people [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=616.4599999999999s)]
*  to the White House and say, we want him out. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=619.06s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=621.5s)]
*  You talking about protestors. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=622.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that ain't going anywhere. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=623.18s)]
*  If you're talking peaceful protestors. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=624.18s)]

*  No, no, no. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=627.14s)]
*  The day that happened. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=628.18s)]
*  I mean, I'm not trying to say go up in arms and stuff, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=629.02s)]
*  but I'm just saying, like, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=632.5799999999999s)]
*  dictators are overthrown by the people. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=633.9799999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=635.74s)]

*  The day that happened, they're going to activate martial law. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=637.78s)]
*  I don't see that. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=640.1s)]
*  Let a million people show up to the White House [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=640.94s)]
*  and watch it happen. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=642.22s)]

*  So Duke Parson is not for us. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=798.22s)]
*  It's not for us. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=800.7800000000001s)]
*  It's only for the people that put in place to help them. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=801.98s)]
*  They're the one who making the ball. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=805.5400000000001s)]
*  So how will we get through Parson? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=806.98s)]
*  But they want us to be patient and understand [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=808.7s)]
*  and go through the process. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=811.62s)]
*  And we'd be patient to go through the process [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=812.6600000000001s)]
*  if that doesn't work for us. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  So when do we stop and stop saying, it's enough? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=815.5400000000001s)]

*  because I mean, you're talking about police officers, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=823.1800000000001s)]
*  not regular everyday citizens. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=826.1800000000001s)]
*  So of course, you know, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=828.26s)]
*  we see police officers get off all the time, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=829.1s)]

*  and just being yourself and being in the midst of the moment. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=877.6600000000001s)]

*  Y'all, I do remember they back at it again. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1081.34s)]
*  Back in December last year, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1083.18s)]
*  Rym exposed the relationship between Pap [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1085.02s)]
*  and Clarissa Shells or whatever. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1087.14s)]
*  And it was a big thing that happened or whatever. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1088.82s)]
*  Now they back for round two. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1090.94s)]
*  So Clarissa was up here on The Breakfast Club. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1092.1s)]
*  The Breakfast Club always get people in trouble. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1093.74s)]
*  As if you're not a member. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1096.5s)]
*  But I didn't ask the question. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1098.5800000000002s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1100.22s)]

*  But we got the audio play deck [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1104.46s)]
*  cause she spoke on something. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1106.14s)]
*  I don't really have to argue about anybody [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1106.98s)]
*  about where my spot is with him. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1108.78s)]
*  You know, like that's not my place now. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1110.5800000000002s)]

*  but it's still, it's not even my stuff to handle. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1114.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1116.6200000000001s)]

*  What do you mean by that? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1119.02s)]
*  See? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1119.8600000000001s)]
*  It's the elephant in the room. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1120.7s)]
*  I don't have to say it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1121.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  In his personal life. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1123.2s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1124.02s)]

*  Like, but that takes time. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1125.7s)]
*  And like I said, that's not my place to speak on. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1127.06s)]

*  I'm with him every day. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1132.6599999999999s)]
*  And when I'm not with him, we're on the phone every day. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1134.5s)]
*  We love each other. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1136.78s)]
*  So that's just kind of what it is. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1137.78s)]
*  So the all is already given. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1139.3799999999999s)]
*  What you saying? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1141.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's, we talk about so many different things. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1142.06s)]
*  I was just clarifying. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1144.58s)]
*  That still has to be taken care of. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1145.4199999999998s)]
*  But like, you know, once again, it's not, it's not for me. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1146.5s)]

*  which I didn't know about the fights that I had to fight [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1311.42s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1327.74s)]
*  If you're dealing with somebody, you know, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1328.58s)]
*  if you're dealing with something like a divorce, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1330.1s)]

*  speaking on y'all in any way, shape or form. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1334.1399999999999s)]
*  Even though Clarissa didn't really say, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1336.3799999999999s)]
*  like didn't say her name, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1338.34s)]
*  well didn't even really say anything like, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1339.46s)]
*  violent or you know, to her. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1341.5s)]

*  But the thing is, well, first of all, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1344.3s)]
*  you're dealing with two of the slickest mouths [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1345.6599999999999s)]
*  in the industry right? Crazy. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1346.9399999999998s)]

*  But the only thing is I hate to say it [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1349.54s)]
*  because I know Remy and I know Pat, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1351.22s)]
*  but the only bad thing about it is [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1352.82s)]
*  if they both moved on, right? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1354.26s)]
*  I think Remy moved on, Pat moved on. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1355.8999999999999s)]
*  We don't want to see this playing out, right? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1359.5s)]
*  Their daughter is going to get to age [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1361.18s)]
*  when she sees stuff online and they love their daughter. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1363.1s)]
*  They love their kids. I hate seeing this. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1365.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, let's be honest. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1367.94s)]
*  We don't want to see it playing out, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1368.94s)]
*  but we want to see it playing out. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1370.78s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1372.18s)]
*  We're not the generation of days of our lives [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1373.18s)]
*  in bold and beautiful. This our story. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1375.02s)]
*  You're right. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1376.46s)]
*  And this is also y'all got to think about [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1377.46s)]
*  what she dealing with too when she wake up and she see, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1378.86s)]
*  like you know how long people have been telling her, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1380.98s)]
*  oh it's her fault, like she cheated and she, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1382.94s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1385.18s)]
*  Like I be seeing people come for both of them, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1386.18s)]
*  like they been on her ass. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1388.78s)]
*  Yeah, they been coming for her. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1390.18s)]
*  And if you have not been speaking on somebody [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1391.18s)]
*  and you hear that new boo speaking on y'all relationship, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1393.86s)]
*  you feel like it's coming from your ex. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1397.34s)]
*  So I can see why that would be true. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1398.9s)]
*  And so, cause that means you talking about what's going on, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1399.74s)]
*  you know, and she's going in all these interviews [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1402.34s)]
*  and she's saying, she's not touching it all the way, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1404.02s)]
*  but she touching on it. You know what I mean? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1406.34s)]
*  The elephant in the room. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1407.94s)]
*  She did make it clear why she left this. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1408.9s)]
*  She ain't even leave after all of that. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1410.94s)]
*  She left. This is why she left. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1412.82s)]
*  When I didn't want a manager anymore, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1414.94s)]
*  when I didn't want somebody taking 20% out of my check [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1418.6200000000001s)]
*  and I still pay all the bills anymore, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1423.14s)]
*  when I decided that I didn't like being guilt tripped, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1426.5s)]
*  oh I was there when nobody else was there. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1430.5800000000002s)]
*  That's the type of people that gets preyed on. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1432.38s)]
*  I'm the one that said, hey, please leave. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1435.02s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1439.98s)]
*  Like this doesn't make sense. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1441.1000000000001s)]
*  Like y'all believed me when I said, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1442.8200000000002s)]
*  this is the most amazing person ever in the whole world. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1445.58s)]
*  That's why y'all think that cause y'all didn't see it. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1447.42s)]
*  I'm lying. I did stupid like, hey, look at my new truck. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1449.38s)]
*  It's a push gift. I bought that. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1452.78s)]
*  So I did do some to put the sauce on it, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1454.66s)]
*  but that's what you're supposed to do [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1457.26s)]
*  when you love somebody and y'all in a relationship. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1458.42s)]
*  You make them see like that bigger than what they are. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1460.18s)]
*  Yeah. And yo, she was live for 80 minutes. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1462.78s)]
*  That was just the first time. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1464.98s)]
*  Y'all was about to say, I didn't hear none of this yesterday. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1466.02s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh no. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1468.14s)]
*  How long was she going live for? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1469.14s)]
*  She went live for 80 minutes the first time. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1470.42s)]
*  And then Pat, he, he, he felt the Lord triggered. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1472.3s)]
*  It was a whole back and forth. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1475.18s)]
*  We ain't going to get to everything, but it was a lot. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1476.14s)]
*  He said this. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1477.66s)]
*  You know, it's true. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1479.14s)]
*  I wrote tons of her music, 90% of her music. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1480.46s)]
*  I wrote it since I've been around her. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1484.9s)]
*  I wrote probably like three songs on her first album. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1487.58s)]
*  If I listen to it, I'll tell you exactly what I wrote. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1492.1s)]
*  And when you listen to it, y'all know my pen. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1494.7s)]
*  The only reason why I'm mentioning that [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1497.06s)]
*  is because you fabricated. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1498.9s)]
*  You fabricated and you talked about my children. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1500.54s)]
*  And as a father, I was not going to allow that. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1503.34s)]
*  I've allowed you to do what you've been doing [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1506.26s)]
*  all of this time. And I said nothing. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1508.42s)]
*  She got mad at me because I went live [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1510.34s)]
*  and said I didn't knock this lame out. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1512.1399999999999s)]
*  Now as a hip hop fan, that's what I need proof of. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1514.6599999999999s)]
*  Like that's a hell of a, that's a hell of a [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1518.22s)]
*  accusation that you wrote. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1520.86s)]
*  90% of Remy's first album. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1522.6599999999999s)]
*  And then I saw Pat say last night that he wrote [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1524.58s)]
*  Conceited. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1527.02s)]
*  I got it. Pat, you got to provide the proof. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1528.3s)]
*  That's her biggest, it's one of her biggest songs. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1529.78s)]
*  I don't care about the relationship stuff. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1531.82s)]
*  That's y'all business. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1533.22s)]
*  But as a hip hop fan, I got to see some proof of that. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1534.06s)]
*  And then also she wanted him to show proof also [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1537.5s)]
*  that she tried to get back with him. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1540.18s)]
*  Cause when he said that, he said, yo, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1541.42s)]
*  you was just trying to get back with me last night. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1542.82s)]
*  And I said, no, she went live again. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1544.26s)]
*  We don't got time to play all that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1546.1s)]
*  But it's basically, it's a lot. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1547.7s)]
*  And then also our biggest argument was like, yo, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1549.66s)]
*  I just, I want the divorce. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1551.66s)]
*  You know, she was saying like, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1552.86s)]
*  if you can't afford the lawyer, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1554.86s)]
*  I'll pay for it or whatever. Right? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1556.66s)]
*  And then, so he posted out of nowhere. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1558.42s)]
*  Yeah. Like filing was the easiest thing to do. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1560.02s)]
*  And she said, if you look on a date, yo, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1562.7s)]
*  you just filed this today. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1564.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, this was yesterday when it was live, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1566.22s)]
*  but he had just went to file yesterday. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1567.78s)]
*  The date is on a paperwork and everything. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1569.74s)]
*  Clarissa also took the Twitter to confirm some things. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1571.66s)]
*  And yeah, y'all can go in there. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1575.3400000000001s)]
*  I can't hear her so much. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1577.0600000000002s)]
*  Can I ask one quick question? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1577.9s)]
*  What's up? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1579.02s)]
*  Why do we always say the elephant in the room? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1579.8600000000001s)]
*  Has there ever been an elephant in any room? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1581.8600000000001s)]
*  No room. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1583.78s)]
*  And how did it get there? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1584.6200000000001s)]
*  No room. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1585.46s)]
*  Why, like, why do we say that? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1586.28s)]
*  Because that's the biggest thing. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1587.3999999999999s)]
*  Cause you know, it's a reference. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1589.4399999999998s)]
*  The biggest thing in the room [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1590.28s)]
*  that nobody's talking about. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1591.12s)]
*  The biggest thing in the room. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1591.9399999999998s)]
*  How could you ever ignore an elephant in the room? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1592.78s)]
*  Who bought it there though? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1594.84s)]
*  No idea. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1596.0s)]
*  You know, Michael Jackson used to have animals everywhere. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1596.9199999999998s)]
*  He did. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1599.0s)]
*  Not in the room. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1599.84s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1600.6799999999998s)]
*  We ain't no elephant in the room that I know of. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1601.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1602.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1603.3999999999999s)]
*  He was asking a question. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1604.2199999999998s)]
*  But anyway, I hate to see this. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1605.06s)]
*  I mean, like I said, we love both of them. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1606.4399999999998s)]
*  And like Charlamagne said, we are hip hop heads. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1608.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, Remy has been spitting since any of the back of the day. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1611.12s)]
*  I just want to know if that was right in Remy raps. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1614.3999999999999s)]
*  That's the only thing I need proof of. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1615.24s)]
*  All that relationship stuff. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1616.28s)]
*  But you also know they try to hurt each other. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1617.1200000000001s)]
*  Like they're trying to hurt each other. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1618.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1619.76s)]
*  Like they're so upset. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1620.58s)]
*  They will say anything to hurt each other. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1621.42s)]
*  We don't necessarily know what's false, what's true, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1622.74s)]
*  but they're trying to hurt each other. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1625.16s)]
*  That's how you know that's a hip hop couple. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1626.0s)]
*  That's how you heard that I wrote your rap. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1627.56s)]
*  What? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1629.48s)]
*  But you don't remember a couple of months ago, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1630.32s)]
*  she was like, I know you going to come out and say, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1632.7s)]
*  you wrote my raps. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1634.34s)]
*  Nobody going to believe that. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1635.48s)]
*  Like she did say that. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1636.4s)]
*  So this must've been being said for years. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1637.56s)]
*  Like even when they was together and arguing, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1639.68s)]
*  he must've said it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1641.32s)]
*  He might've been rapping it when they was arguing. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1642.76s)]
*  What's the couple of things you don't want to hear? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1644.88s)]
*  Is somebody got a small pee pee? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1646.44s)]
*  Did anybody say that yet? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1647.76s)]
*  All right, then we see. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1649.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm talking about rapping. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1649.84s)]
*  Listen, the way I rap, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1650.68s)]
*  that's the thing I mean. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1651.52s)]
*  But that's how you hurt somebody. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1652.3600000000001s)]
*  But this all started on the Breakfast Club. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1654.2s)]
*  This is what I want y'all to know. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1657.04s)]
*  No, that is not true. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1657.88s)]
*  And we have to stop doing that to people up here. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1658.72s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1660.88s)]
*  That is not true. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1661.72s)]
*  It was the elephant. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1662.56s)]
*  Well, shut up. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1664.04s)]

*  in constant contact with President Trump since it happened. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1735.88s)]
*  And the death penalty for Rodriguez is a possibility. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1739.1200000000001s)]
*  She made these comments yesterday. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1741.8000000000002s)]
*  So just don't want you to get confused about her saying [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1743.44s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1745.5600000000002s)]
*  She's speaking in reference to Wednesday. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1746.52s)]
*  So let's take a listen to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1748.1200000000001s)]
*  I was on the phone with Donald Trump all evening long, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1751.3600000000001s)]
*  all evening. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1754.44s)]
*  He called me first thing this morning. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1755.0800000000002s)]
*  He is horrified by what happened. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1757.16s)]
*  Two beautiful young people were gunned down last night [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1759.96s)]
*  needlessly. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1763.48s)]
*  You know, I saw his body being taken away from the scene. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1765.4s)]
*  That was horrific. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1768.8400000000001s)]
*  So meanwhile, Senators John Thune and Chuck Schumer [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1770.16s)]
*  are speaking out about the incident. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1774.0s)]
*  Senator Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he's disgusted, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1775.68s)]
*  while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said people [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1780.48s)]
*  should be outraged about this incident. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1783.32s)]
*  Let's take a listen to their comments. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1785.16s)]
*  From everything we know so far, it is appallingly clear [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1787.08s)]
*  that a van attendees were deliberately targeted. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1790.1200000000001s)]
*  Such a blatant and targeted act of anti-Semitism [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1793.96s)]
*  right here in the nation's capital [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1797.0s)]
*  should outrage everybody. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1798.96s)]
*  A beautiful young couple about to be married, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1801.16s)]
*  just starting their lives, gunned down seemingly [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1803.3600000000001s)]
*  because they were Jewish. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1808.68s)]
*  Yeah, very, very sad situation. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1810.24s)]
*  I'll keep you guys posted on that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1811.88s)]
*  Now, Senator Schumer also used his time on the floor [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1814.36s)]
*  to address the passage of President Trump's [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1817.08s)]
*  big, beautiful bill. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1819.24s)]
*  And speaking of which, President Trump's big, beautiful bill [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1820.84s)]
*  did pass yesterday morning on a vote of 215 to 214 [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1823.8s)]
*  with all Democrats and two Republicans voting no. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1827.36s)]
*  House Speaker Mike Johnson is offering some advice [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1830.84s)]
*  to his colleagues in the Senate who will now take up the measure. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1833.32s)]
*  After the vote, Johnson says he hopes [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1836.7199999999998s)]
*  the Senate will pass the bill so it can be on President Trump's [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1838.4799999999998s)]
*  desk by July 4th. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1842.48s)]
*  Let's take a listen to House Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1844.92s)]
*  We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1847.0800000000002s)]
*  of this once in a generation legislation. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1849.28s)]
*  We stand ready to continue our work together [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1851.64s)]
*  to deliver on the one big, beautiful bill [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1853.52s)]
*  as President Trump named it himself. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1856.56s)]
*  We're going to send that to his desk. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1858.8s)]
*  We're going to get there by Independence Day on July 4th, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1860.48s)]
*  and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1863.2s)]
*  It's definitely going to be new, but giving is giving new. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1867.48s)]
*  All right, so senators have already promised [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1870.76s)]
*  to make some changes to that bill. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1872.68s)]
*  If it does become law, it would institute reforms to Medicaid, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1874.48s)]
*  including stricter work requirements [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1878.28s)]
*  and more frequent eligibility checks. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1880.2s)]
*  It's estimated the US will save at least $625 billion, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1884.8s)]
*  but it also means 7.6 million Americans [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1888.72s)]
*  will lose health insurance over the next 10 years. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1891.64s)]
*  It would also eliminate taxes on tips [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1895.04s)]
*  while putting billions towards fighting illegal immigration [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1897.0s)]
*  and a nationwide defense system like the Golden Dome [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1899.8s)]
*  I mentioned earlier this week, among other things. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1902.64s)]
*  So I will continue to keep you guys posted [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1906.2s)]
*  as to what's happening. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1908.12s)]
*  I believe that per this Memorial Day weekend, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1909.2s)]
*  Congress is headed to a recess, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1913.6s)]
*  so they'll be on recess all of next week, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1915.76s)]
*  and then they will return the following week. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1917.8s)]
*  And speaking of Memorial Day, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1920.68s)]
*  the weekend travel rush is already under way. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1921.84s)]
*  Peak airport crowds are expected today, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1924.24s)]
*  with the FAA expecting record-breaking travel. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1926.76s)]
*  Over 3.5 million people are expected [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1930.0s)]
*  to get to their destination by plane, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1931.8s)]
*  an almost 2% increase from last year. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1933.8s)]
*  And then, of course, they're also seeing people on the roads. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1937.16s)]
*  AAA is forecasting 45 million Americans [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1940.44s)]
*  will hit the road between today and Monday [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1943.52s)]
*  for the holiday weekend. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1945.28s)]
*  So yeah, if you're headed out like you and V, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1947.04s)]
*  just make sure you guys are safe, pack your patience, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1950.28s)]
*  and treat others with some kindness and respect, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1952.28s)]
*  because between Real ID and the administration [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1954.84s)]
*  and everything else that's going on, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1957.96s)]
*  we could all use a little bit of vacation, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1960.12s)]
*  a little bit of a break, but in order to get to that break, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1962.22s)]
*  we might have to stand in some lines [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1964.58s)]
*  and wait in some traffic, so just keep that in. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1966.46s)]
*  Yeah, like you said, give yourself a little extra time, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1968.32s)]
*  and remember, if somebody's a little late and they rushing, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1971.04s)]
*  and you got a little time, let them through. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1973.3999999999999s)]
*  Let them through. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  You don't know what their day was, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1975.7s)]
*  what they've been through, what happened. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1976.56s)]
*  They could've got a flat tire on the way to the airport. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1978.12s)]
*  Give people some grace today, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1980.36s)]
*  or this weekend, I should say. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1981.6s)]
*  All right, man. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1982.76s)]
*  And one more thing real quick, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1983.6s)]
*  I can shout out the 82 Second Airborne Infantry Division [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1985.0600000000002s)]
*  in celebration of their All-American Week. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1987.66s)]
*  They reached out to me saying that they listened to us [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1989.8000000000002s)]
*  on Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Foxy 99, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1991.5600000000002s)]
*  so hashtag airborne all the way. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1994.5s)]
*  And of course, I wanna salute all of our military [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1996.26s)]
*  and our service leaders who have made the ultimate sacrifice. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=1999.9s)]
*  That is what Memorial Day is all about. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2002.8200000000002s)]

*  Morning, everybody. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2068.2599999999998s)]
*  It's the JNV Jess Hilarious, Charlemagne the Guy. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2069.1s)]
*  We are The Breakfast Club. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2072.5s)]
*  We got a special guest in the building, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2073.98s)]
*  American gun control activist and political strategist, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2075.88s)]
*  and co-chair of the DNC. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2078.7s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, we have David Hogg. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2080.18s)]
*  Good to see you, man. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2081.8199999999997s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2082.66s)]
*  You know, I really appreciate a lot of the things [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2083.48s)]
*  that you've been doing, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2085.14s)]
*  because you are challenging the Democratic establishment, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2086.7s)]
*  and I just think we need more of that. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2090.08s)]
*  Yeah, I certainly agree. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2092.3399999999997s)]
*  I think the fact of the matter is right now, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2093.66s)]
*  we have seen, last election, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2095.74s)]
*  we lost voting share with nearly [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2097.54s)]
*  every single demographic out there, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2098.9s)]
*  and we also lost against Donald Trump, of all people, right? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2101.34s)]
*  And if that's not a sign that we need to dramatically change, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2104.52s)]
*  I don't know what is. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2106.7s)]
*  So that's really what we're out here trying to do, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2107.62s)]
*  is help to elevate a new generation, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2109.92s)]
*  and also make sure that nobody feels like, you know, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2112.2599999999998s)]
*  that they can just be in their position of power forever, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2114.98s)]
*  because ultimately this is democracy, last I checked, right? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2117.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's about making sure that we have [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2120.42s)]
*  the best representation possible in every district. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2121.54s)]
*  Do you feel like the Democratic establishment [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2124.38s)]
*  uses young activists as mascots more than partners? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2126.06s)]
*  Certainly at times, it can happen. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2129.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I know for a fact, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2131.38s)]
*  when I started running for this position, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2133.7s)]
*  you know, there were people who were certainly resistant, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2137.06s)]
*  who I ended up talking to a lot of the time. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2139.34s)]
*  That was actually one of my favorite parts [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2141.14s)]
*  about running for this position, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2142.2999999999997s)]
*  because when you're running to be a vice chair, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2143.86s)]
*  you have to call people and obviously earn their vote. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2145.18s)]
*  And one of my favorite parts about it [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2147.98s)]
*  was talking to the people who, at first, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2149.2799999999997s)]
*  did not want to vote for me at all. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2151.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, there was one person who I talked to [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2153.14s)]
*  who actually said in one of my first calls [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2154.62s)]
*  that I made to ask for their support that, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2156.8199999999997s)]
*  I'd never talked to this person before this, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2158.7799999999997s)]
*  that said that I should not do this, I cannot win, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2160.62s)]
*  and that there's absolutely no pathway to victory for me, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2163.5s)]
*  and that they would not vote for me. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2165.98s)]
*  That was the first call that I had. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2167.06s)]
*  Very welcoming, right? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2169.42s)]
*  But what I said to them was like, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2170.94s)]
*  I understand that you're not in a position [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2172.38s)]
*  where you feel like you're not gonna be able to support me, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2174.42s)]
*  but ultimately I care a lot about the constituency group [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2175.86s)]
*  that you represent, so I wanna keep talking to you, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2178.0s)]
*  because even if you don't vote for me, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2179.9s)]
*  I do care about what you care about. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2181.2599999999998s)]
*  And ultimately they ended up coming around [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2183.06s)]
*  and supporting me and being a huge supporter as well. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2185.54s)]
*  And you were a survivor of the Parkland shooting. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2187.7599999999998s)]
*  Was that what sparked the thought to get into politics? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2189.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, before this I wanted to be a journalist [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2192.88s)]
*  because I wanted to scare the crap out of politicians [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2195.6s)]
*  that I thought were corrupt as hell [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2197.7599999999998s)]
*  and didn't do anything ultimately. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2199.4s)]
*  But I realized after Parkland, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2201.24s)]
*  when my classmates and I mobilized [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2203.2799999999997s)]
*  for people that may not remember, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2204.7599999999998s)]
*  we had one of the largest school shootings [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2206.42s)]
*  in American history happened at my high school in Parkland. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2209.6s)]
*  And my classmates and I were obviously devastated [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2211.88s)]
*  after that, but I would say just as much as that, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2215.32s)]
*  we were furious, because we grew up hearing [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2216.64s)]
*  from our politicians, their thoughts and prayers [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2218.96s)]
*  over and over again after these shootings, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2221.38s)]
*  but they weren't really doing anything, right? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2223.1s)]
*  I think I was in middle school when Sandy Hook happened. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2225.08s)]
*  I wasn't even alive when Columbine happened. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2227.84s)]
*  That's how long this has been going on for. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2229.7200000000003s)]
*  And we went out there and we didn't say, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2231.48s)]
*  go out and vote for Democrats or Republicans necessarily. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2233.36s)]
*  We said, go out and vote for more religious leaders [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2236.64s)]
*  that represent you and your values, right? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2238.28s)]
*  And what we saw was one of the largest youth voter turnouts [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2240.44s)]
*  in American history. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2243.08s)]
*  We took back the house. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2244.0s)]
*  And what we saw as well is after Parkland, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2245.28s)]
*  we didn't go out there, even though there was a lot [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2247.82s)]
*  of the pollsters and consultants and pundits [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2249.52s)]
*  that brought the Democratic party to the place [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2251.7200000000003s)]
*  that it is right now, who told us, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2253.28s)]
*  no, you can't talk about taking on the NRA, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2255.56s)]
*  the organization that stops these gun laws [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2257.7200000000003s)]
*  from changing a lot of the time. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2259.2400000000002s)]
*  Insanity. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2260.2000000000003s)]
*  You can't talk about banning assault weapons [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2261.04s)]
*  because that's too unpopular, because this is Florida. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2262.44s)]
*  It's a Republican state, gun laws get weaker here. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2264.36s)]
*  Because we did the opposite [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2266.6s)]
*  of what all those purported experts told us to do, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2267.8s)]
*  we actually did change gun laws in Florida. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2270.62s)]
*  Yeah, because you're not fixing the problem [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2272.48s)]
*  if you don't go after those things. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2273.72s)]
*  Exactly, you have to address it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2274.68s)]
*  And because of that, we raised the age to buy a gun to 21, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2276.48s)]
*  for context of the shooter at my high school. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2279.3199999999997s)]
*  He couldn't buy a handgun from a federally licensed dealer [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2281.08s)]
*  because he wasn't 21 yet, but he could purchase an AR-15. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2284.04s)]
*  And then we passed a red flag law that can disarm people [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2287.06s)]
*  that are risk themselves and others. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2289.8799999999997s)]
*  It has been used over 19,000 times in the state of Florida [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2291.3999999999996s)]
*  to disarm people that, for example, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2294.72s)]
*  threatened to shoot up a high school [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2296.2s)]
*  or harm their intimate partner, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2297.48s)]
*  and thousands of lives have been saved from that. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2299.56s)]
*  And what I learned from that experience [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2301.24s)]
*  is that it's actually summed up well by Dolores Reta, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2304.02s)]
*  who I asked one time at a protest, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2306.18s)]
*  what is the most important thing [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2307.86s)]
*  that you need to tell any young person or activist [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2309.02s)]
*  that wants to make change that they need to know? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2311.1s)]
*  And what she said to me is it doesn't matter [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2313.46s)]
*  whether or not the change is actually possible, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2314.98s)]
*  it's whether or not you can make people believe [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2317.86s)]
*  that the change is possible more than anything. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2320.06s)]
*  And that's what we did after Parkland. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2321.9s)]
*  And I think what we're trying to do now [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2323.1s)]
*  is take that generation of young people [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2324.94s)]
*  who have been let down in so many ways [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2327.34s)]
*  by their political system, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2329.18s)]
*  whether it's through gun violence inside of school [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2330.38s)]
*  or outside of school, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2332.38s)]
*  whether it's the housing crisis, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2333.6600000000003s)]
*  the student debt crisis or so much more, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2335.06s)]
*  and show them that there's a new generation [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2337.3s)]
*  of people coming in [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2339.06s)]
*  that are people like Congressman Maxwell Frost. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2340.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you know this person, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2342.1s)]
*  he's the youngest member of Congress. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2343.1s)]
*  He started, he was working for March for Our Lives [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2344.94s)]
*  while I was in college, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2347.82s)]
*  and he called me up and he said he wanted to run for Congress. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2349.1s)]
*  And I said, that's awesome, but you know you're 24, right? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2351.52s)]
*  You have to be 25 to get elected to Congress. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2353.78s)]
*  And Maxwell, you know, he didn't come [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2355.9s)]
*  from some super fancy background, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2357.26s)]
*  his parents aren't super wealthy or anything like that, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2359.2200000000003s)]
*  he's just a normal person. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2360.82s)]
*  When he was running, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2362.8599999999997s)]
*  he had to Uber drive from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2364.06s)]
*  every night while running for Congress. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2366.8599999999997s)]
*  And he was running [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2368.98s)]
*  against two former members of Congress, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2369.8199999999997s)]
*  one of whom was a hedge fund manager [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2371.46s)]
*  while they were a member of Congress, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2373.18s)]
*  not a conflict of interest at all, right? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2374.66s)]
*  And then the other one had committed tax fraud [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2376.8999999999996s)]
*  while they were in Congress. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2379.2599999999998s)]
*  And Maxwell was written off by the establishment so much, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2380.3799999999997s)]
*  they said, you know, he's a great person, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2382.5s)]
*  but he can't win, he can't raise that kind of money. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2384.18s)]
*  And we helped him raise, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2386.14s)]
*  I helped him raise about $400,000 [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2387.3999999999996s)]
*  in his first two quarters, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2389.06s)]
*  but the thing is, the most important thing [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2389.8999999999996s)]
*  that somebody needs to run for office [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2391.8s)]
*  is the will, the grit and the determination to get elected, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2393.04s)]
*  but they also need a substantial amount of funding [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2395.6400000000003s)]
*  in order to get elected. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2398.7200000000003s)]
*  And far too many young people [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2399.88s)]
*  with that grit and determination struggle to get there. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2401.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's why we do what we do with leaders we deserve, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2403.6800000000003s)]
*  because Maxwell ended up with that determination [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2405.48s)]
*  and that support, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2408.1400000000003s)]
*  becoming the youngest member of Congress [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2409.1600000000003s)]
*  that helped to spearhead an effort [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2411.5800000000004s)]
*  to get the Biden administration to address gun violence [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2413.48s)]
*  in a more substantial manner. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2416.4s)]
*  And both shortly after I graduated from college, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2417.36s)]
*  I found myself sitting in the Rose Garden [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2420.64s)]
*  at the White House with Congressman Maxwell Frost, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2422.7599999999998s)]
*  who I had just, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2425.96s)]
*  I literally hired from my freshman dorm room, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2427.16s)]
*  introducing the president of the United States [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2429.4s)]
*  to create something called [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2431.38s)]
*  the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2432.48s)]
*  that helped to coordinate [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2434.2599999999998s)]
*  the federal government's response to gun violence. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2435.1s)]
*  And they oversaw about a 25% reduction in gun homicides [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2437.06s)]
*  over the course of about three years from that work. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2440.16s)]
*  And that's because of the pressure [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2442.72s)]
*  that Maxwell helped to put on. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2443.6s)]
*  But imagine if we had 30 Maxwells in Congress. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2444.54s)]
*  David, going back to the shooting, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2448.16s)]
*  you were just 17 when that happened, right? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2450.6s)]
*  I can only imagine like what was, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2453.06s)]
*  I know you said you guys were furious, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2454.92s)]
*  but what is something from that day? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2456.42s)]
*  What do you remember most about that day [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2458.92s)]
*  that sticks with you today? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2460.64s)]
*  I think what I remember most was just the sense of anger [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2463.16s)]
*  that I had at what had happened, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2466.7799999999997s)]
*  but it was more righteous indignation kind of, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2468.96s)]
*  it like the injustice of what had happened. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2470.8799999999997s)]
*  Because I had spent the past four years [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2473.3599999999997s)]
*  in my speech and debate classes studying, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2475.36s)]
*  arguing about gun control, for example, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2478.6000000000004s)]
*  and having to argue on both sides of it, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2481.0800000000004s)]
*  both for and against it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2482.48s)]
*  You don't get to decide which side you're arguing on, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2483.56s)]
*  you have to argue on both. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2485.56s)]
*  And I was frustrated because I felt like I maybe myself [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2486.6000000000004s)]
*  and my classmates could have done something before this [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2489.92s)]
*  because of what we knew from that education that we did it, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2491.76s)]
*  that could have potentially prevented it. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2495.4s)]
*  So that's a lot of what I think about. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2496.96s)]
*  And of course too, the fear that one has [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2498.28s)]
*  when my sister was just 14 years old that day, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2500.9s)]
*  and she lost four friends. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2504.12s)]
*  That's really what I was thinking about was [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2506.7999999999997s)]
*  for the first time in my life, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2508.6s)]
*  there wasn't anything that I could do [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2510.24s)]
*  to help my sister feel better [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2511.42s)]
*  other than to try to stop this from happening [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2512.64s)]
*  to other people. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2514.08s)]
*  And that sense of helplessness is really what I hold onto. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2514.92s)]
*  But I also remember the friendship and camaraderie [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2517.24s)]
*  that my classmates and I and the parents and teachers [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2519.7999999999997s)]
*  and other people that we worked with had [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2522.3199999999997s)]
*  in order to hold these politicians feet to the fire. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2524.4s)]
*  Because if there's anything that I learned [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2526.24s)]
*  from that experience, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2527.7999999999997s)]
*  when I originally went out and started talking about it, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2528.96s)]
*  I wasn't doing it as an activist. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2531.12s)]
*  I was doing it as a journalist [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2533.28s)]
*  because I wanted to talk about what happened that day. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2534.32s)]
*  But I soon realized it wasn't gonna be enough to do that [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2535.86s)]
*  because you can't just talk about what's wrong. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2539.44s)]
*  You gotta make it better and say what needs to be done right. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2541.4s)]
*  And journalists often can't do that. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2544.0800000000004s)]
*  We're still kicking in with the co-chair [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2546.1800000000003s)]
*  of the DNC, David Hogg, Charlemagne. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2547.52s)]
*  Let me ask you a question, David. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2549.8s)]
*  At what moment did you realize you were more of a threat [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2550.6400000000003s)]
*  than an asset to democratic leadership? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2553.7200000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't say that I'm a, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2556.36s)]
*  I would say that I'm still an asset [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2558.0400000000004s)]
*  because I would say that this much is true, right? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2559.4s)]
*  If you're in democratic leadership, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2561.5800000000004s)]
*  it's kind of like being the coach of a baseball team, right? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2562.78s)]
*  Like, sure, could you go out against a group of fifth graders [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2565.2200000000003s)]
*  and hit a home run? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2567.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2568.6200000000003s)]
*  But ultimately, if you can't get other people on base, right, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2569.5400000000004s)]
*  because they can't even swing the bat, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2573.0600000000004s)]
*  sometimes it's not a matter [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2574.5s)]
*  of what type of bat they're using. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2576.38s)]
*  It's a matter of can they swing [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2578.26s)]
*  to actually get on base in the first place. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2579.78s)]
*  And it's a matter of getting new players ultimately. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2582.38s)]
*  It's not a matter of, oh, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2584.34s)]
*  can we just do more and more training? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2585.1800000000003s)]
*  And I think what we need to do more of in our own party [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2587.46s)]
*  is yes, we have to fight back to defeat Republicans, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2589.7000000000003s)]
*  but we also need to give people something true [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2592.58s)]
*  and authentic to vote for, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2594.98s)]
*  where we're showing people how the reason you vote for us [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2596.94s)]
*  isn't just so that we have a majority, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2599.58s)]
*  it's so that we use our majority to help you, right? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2601.54s)]
*  Because if we stuck with that politics of cowardice, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2604.4s)]
*  we never would have passed the Affordable Care Act [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2606.8199999999997s)]
*  in the first place. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2609.42s)]
*  We never would have passed so many [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2610.2999999999997s)]
*  of the most monumental pieces of legislation [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2611.54s)]
*  that now are helping hundreds of millions of Americans [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2613.9s)]
*  around the country. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2616.2799999999997s)]
*  Of course, there are challenges with democratic leadership, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2617.2599999999998s)]
*  but what I would say is especially in the case [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2619.22s)]
*  of somebody like Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2621.3s)]
*  let's get him the majority so we can see [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2622.6600000000003s)]
*  what he can actually do with that majority in the first place. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2624.7400000000002s)]
*  He's not gonna do anything. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2627.02s)]
*  And I can see, here's the thing, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2628.1800000000003s)]
*  and I treat it like anything else, right? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2629.26s)]
*  Like, you know how they say money doesn't change you? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2631.1800000000003s)]
*  It just multiplies whatever you already are. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2634.7000000000003s)]
*  More power is not gonna change these people. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2638.5800000000004s)]
*  If you're a coward with no power, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2640.7000000000003s)]
*  you're gonna be a coward with power. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2642.9s)]
*  We've seen plenty of Democrats who have power [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2644.42s)]
*  who are still cowards. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2646.42s)]
*  Hakeem ain't gonna do nothing different with power. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2647.82s)]
*  Well, I think if we have the right people elected [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2650.1s)]
*  that are out there, they're gonna be able, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2653.7s)]
*  ultimately, sometimes it's not a matter [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2655.14s)]
*  of what you wanna do when you have to get elected [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2656.98s)]
*  to those positions within the House, for example. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2659.16s)]
*  If we get more people elected that are saying, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2661.06s)]
*  no, this is not enough, we have to fight harder, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2663.18s)]
*  that we're not just gonna stick [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2665.62s)]
*  in our positions of power forever. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2667.5s)]
*  And we're going to say to you, for example, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2669.22s)]
*  that if we're gonna vote for you, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2671.06s)]
*  this is what we wanna see, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2672.66s)]
*  because obviously he has to be elected [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2674.06s)]
*  to be the majority speaker of the House. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2675.42s)]
*  By having some more of those young people [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2677.3399999999997s)]
*  that are on the front lines of these issues [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2680.7000000000003s)]
*  of addressing that, I know in those internal deliberations [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2681.54s)]
*  that it's not so much a matter of what he wants to do, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2683.7000000000003s)]
*  it's more a matter of if he wants to get elected, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2686.06s)]
*  he's going to have to be able to fight harder. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2688.3s)]
*  And I know that those young people will push him to do that. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2690.14s)]
*  And if they feel like he's not going to, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2693.2200000000003s)]
*  then they won't vote for him. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2694.54s)]
*  Have you ever been directly warned [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2695.94s)]
*  by anyone in the Democratic Party to stay in your lane? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2697.54s)]
*  There certainly are real challenges [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2701.14s)]
*  to the work that we are doing, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2703.14s)]
*  but I'm not gonna let that stop me. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2704.1800000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't say necessarily that it's like somebody [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2706.2200000000003s)]
*  is directly coming to me and saying, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2708.14s)]
*  if you don't stop this, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2709.34s)]
*  this is gonna happen to you or something like that. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2710.1400000000003s)]
*  But that's not how a lot of these things work [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2712.42s)]
*  inside of DC a lot of the time. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2715.1000000000004s)]
*  It's not necessarily an overt threat. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2716.38s)]
*  It is essentially a tacit threat [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2719.1800000000003s)]
*  that we hear a lot of the time, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2721.0600000000004s)]
*  knowing that if X thing happens, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2722.26s)]
*  then Y could happen to you. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2723.78s)]
*  Why not call it out though? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2725.1800000000003s)]
*  Why not just- [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2726.82s)]
*  Because ultimately it is, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2727.6600000000003s)]
*  what I care more about is when there are people [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2729.1000000000004s)]
*  that go against me, whether it was, for example, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2732.2200000000003s)]
*  in the vice chair race, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2734.6200000000003s)]
*  I know the power from my own work [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2736.1800000000003s)]
*  in gun violence prevention of being a bigger person, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2737.66s)]
*  working towards victory. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2741.38s)]
*  And ultimately when you do that, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2743.14s)]
*  a lot of those people start to come around [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2744.7799999999997s)]
*  because a lot of the time in DC, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2746.14s)]
*  we have a lot of windsocks [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2747.58s)]
*  that go just whichever way the wind is blowing, right? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2749.02s)]
*  Whichever side that they think is gonna win. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2751.2999999999997s)]
*  And I believe in a politics of being able [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2753.22s)]
*  to reconcile those differences and work together, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2754.7799999999997s)]
*  despite what people say, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2757.2599999999998s)]
*  because what's even more powerful Charlemagne [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2758.2599999999998s)]
*  is that when somebody comes out [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2760.42s)]
*  and tries to go overtly against you, right? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2762.1s)]
*  And they know that they did that to you, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2765.02s)]
*  but they see that you start to win [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2766.98s)]
*  and that's ultimately what they care most about. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2768.26s)]
*  Then if you don't go out there [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2770.2200000000003s)]
*  and start calling them out publicly, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2772.1s)]
*  one, it's not nearly as divisive. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2773.26s)]
*  And two, it shows that you're trying to be a real leader. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2774.98s)]
*  And ultimately they, and oftentimes feel guilty about it. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2777.9s)]
*  And they wanna try to make up for it [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2781.7000000000003s)]
*  by working to help you [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2783.14s)]
*  because they wanna be on the side of winning. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2784.1s)]
*  And ultimately that's what we're trying to do here, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2785.82s)]
*  if that makes sense. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2787.58s)]
*  How do you respond to people that say [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2788.42s)]
*  that your work is too political? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2790.14s)]
*  Like you don't really- [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2792.46s)]
*  You're staying your lane. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2793.3s)]
*  Yeah, like you're doing this [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2794.14s)]
*  for selfish reasons and not because you actually care [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2795.86s)]
*  about the whole party. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2798.7400000000002s)]
*  It's to advance your political career. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2800.54s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2802.54s)]
*  So what I'll say is when I was 18, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2803.7000000000003s)]
*  I said that I wanted to run for Congress [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2805.7400000000002s)]
*  because I thought that would be the best way to make change. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2808.3s)]
*  But I realized when I was working with people like Maxwell [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2811.1s)]
*  and other young people around the country, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2813.6600000000003s)]
*  how hard it is to raise money [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2816.1s)]
*  and get the resources to get elected. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2817.46s)]
*  Because of course, courage is that resource [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2819.3s)]
*  that we lack the most, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2821.1400000000003s)]
*  but those courageous people, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2822.38s)]
*  they need cash in order to get elected. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2823.7s)]
*  And I could be one person myself to go out there [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2826.06s)]
*  and maybe I get elected to Congress, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2828.3399999999997s)]
*  but ultimately what is gonna be more beneficial [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2830.3799999999997s)]
*  for the future, right? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2833.3799999999997s)]
*  One, I often do get physically threatened, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2834.3399999999997s)]
*  not necessarily by Democrats necessarily by any means, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2836.66s)]
*  but by a lot of people who don't agree with the things [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2839.8199999999997s)]
*  that I say about strengthening gun laws. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2842.46s)]
*  My family and I, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2844.9399999999996s)]
*  we got probably over a thousand death threats [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2845.7799999999997s)]
*  after the shooting, I would say, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2847.66s)]
*  between online and directly in the mail. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2848.62s)]
*  My house got swatted as well. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2850.9399999999996s)]
*  What I frankly have to think about is that [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2854.3s)]
*  I can't just be one person doing this, right? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2857.02s)]
*  And there's a whole movement of people out there [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2859.66s)]
*  that are doing this, a whole movement of young people [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2861.22s)]
*  that have gone through these school shootings. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2863.46s)]
*  And what I wanna help do [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2864.78s)]
*  is I don't wanna just be one vote that's out there. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2866.22s)]
*  I wanna help bring in a generation [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2868.74s)]
*  that is truly representative of our generation [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2870.42s)]
*  and not just what somebody who's able to raise [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2872.74s)]
*  as much money as possible to get elected looks like. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2875.34s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to do with this [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2877.38s)]
*  is look at all the candidates [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2878.98s)]
*  that we supported last cycle [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2880.26s)]
*  where we helped elect the youngest person [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2881.38s)]
*  in the Georgia legislature ever [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2882.94s)]
*  who's a seventh grade algebra teacher. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2884.7000000000003s)]
*  Look at the person who we elected, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2886.18s)]
*  Dante Pittman in North Carolina, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2887.5s)]
*  who helped to break the Republican super majority out there. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2889.14s)]
*  Look at people like Naderius Clark in Virginia [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2892.02s)]
*  who broke the Republican majority in the house [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2894.06s)]
*  and helped pass all this stuff. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2896.06s)]
*  So the reason why I'm doing this [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2897.18s)]
*  is because I don't wanna just walk through that door myself [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2898.7400000000002s)]
*  and close it behind me. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2900.66s)]
*  I don't wanna just keep the door open. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2902.14s)]
*  I wanna take the door off the damn hinges [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2904.1s)]
*  and enable it so that future young people [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2906.2200000000003s)]
*  don't need to have the door held open [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2908.46s)]
*  for them in the first place. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2910.38s)]
*  What they need to do that though [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2911.5s)]
*  is they need the funding to get elected [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2913.6200000000003s)]
*  and make sure that they have the right values [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2914.9s)]
*  so that they're able to reform our campaign finance system. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2916.5400000000004s)]
*  Because what I look at this as ultimately [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2919.02s)]
*  is an insurance policy for the gun safety movement [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2921.78s)]
*  where President Biden's generation, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2924.42s)]
*  they didn't go through school shooter drills, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2926.6600000000003s)]
*  but they went through a different type of drill. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2928.82s)]
*  They went through nuclear bomb drills [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2930.98s)]
*  and they went on to pass some of the largest [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2932.42s)]
*  arms reduction treaties in human history [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2933.78s)]
*  to limit those nuclear weapons. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2936.1400000000003s)]
*  And I think that's in part because they felt the anxiety [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2937.26s)]
*  of what it was like to be told by your government, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2939.5800000000004s)]
*  just hide under your desk to survive a nuclear bomb [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2942.46s)]
*  and the epic failure of leadership that that is. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2945.1s)]
*  And I believe for the difference from our generation [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2947.7s)]
*  is that the bomb is going off multiple times a year. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2950.86s)]
*  Absolutely. Right? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2953.3s)]
*  So let's get them elected so that they can lead [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2954.38s)]
*  like Congressman Frost boldly on this [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2957.1s)]
*  instead of me just being one vote [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2959.46s)]
*  because it's about our generation [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2960.94s)]
*  and the story of are we gonna continue having conversations [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2962.98s)]
*  like this in the future where school shootings [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2965.42s)]
*  remain in the headlines and gun violence remains [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2966.98s)]
*  in the headlines and so many issues [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2968.66s)]
*  that we should not have to deal with [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2970.5s)]
*  in the richest country in human history [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2971.66s)]
*  remain in the headlines or are we gonna leave them [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2973.46s)]
*  where they belong in the history books? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2975.3399999999997s)]
*  We still have David Hogg in the building, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2977.22s)]
*  co-chair of the DNC. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2978.98s)]
*  Charlemagne? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2980.42s)]
*  Give me some other names [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2981.58s)]
*  because you keep mentioning Maxwell Frost. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2982.42s)]
*  Who do you think is the voice of the Democratic Party? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2984.14s)]
*  Or who do you think should be the voice [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2986.3399999999997s)]
*  of the Democratic Party? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2987.9s)]
*  Or is there multiple voices? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2988.74s)]
*  Well, I think one, there's gonna be multiple voices. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2990.5s)]
*  I think one of the great things about our party [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2992.42s)]
*  that also creates some challenges is look, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2995.2599999999998s)]
*  we are not a cult. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2997.18s)]
*  We can have- I can't tell in recent years. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=2998.62s)]
*  Well, sometimes I understand what you're saying, certainly, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3000.74s)]
*  given some of the responses that I've gotten to this, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3003.54s)]
*  but ultimately we are not a party [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3005.4599999999996s)]
*  with somebody like Donald Trump at the top [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3006.8599999999997s)]
*  that says you have to believe every single thing right here [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3008.18s)]
*  or else you were excommunicated [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3011.58s)]
*  and we're gonna try to destroy your life necessarily. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3013.18s)]
*  It's not nearly- [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3015.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know if that's true, David. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3016.1s)]
*  Well- [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3016.9399999999996s)]
*  I've looked at the way people would really get upset [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3017.7799999999997s)]
*  with you if you had anything negative to say [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3020.74s)]
*  about President Biden when he was the one [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3023.3799999999997s)]
*  that we should have been speaking out about the most. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3025.66s)]
*  Right, and I completely agree with you, actually. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3027.98s)]
*  I think one of the challenges in that regard [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3031.34s)]
*  that we have to address in our politics [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3034.62s)]
*  is that we have created a culture [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3036.78s)]
*  where people are told repeatedly what they wanna hear [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3038.42s)]
*  instead of what they need to hear, right? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3041.1s)]
*  What I believe happened in that regard is, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3043.26s)]
*  look, when you're in the White House, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3045.62s)]
*  and I've seen this in different ways, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3047.14s)]
*  either in the White House or in other places, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3048.38s)]
*  you wanna keep your job. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3050.5s)]
*  And the best way to do that is ensure [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3051.78s)]
*  that you get this person re-elected again. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3053.02s)]
*  And I think what happens far too often in our politics [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3055.02s)]
*  is that people get too comfortable [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3058.22s)]
*  and they just tell people what they want to hear [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3060.06s)]
*  instead of what they need to hear [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3061.98s)]
*  over and over and over and over again. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3063.22s)]
*  And frankly, part of why I'm doing this [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3065.42s)]
*  is because I met with President Biden in 2023 [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3068.1s)]
*  for an hour in the Oval Office. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3071.2599999999998s)]
*  And one of the things that- [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3073.54s)]
*  I'm sorry that happened to you. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3075.5s)]
*  Well, it was a good meeting, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3076.66s)]
*  and it was after he created [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3078.06s)]
*  the Office of Gun Violence Prevention at the White House [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3080.06s)]
*  that saw about a 25% reduction [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3082.2599999999998s)]
*  in gun homicides around the country. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3084.8599999999997s)]
*  Part of the challenge is though, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3086.54s)]
*  you're not gonna hear about the shooting [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3087.4599999999996s)]
*  that doesn't happen. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3088.4599999999996s)]
*  But I was meeting with him in that regard. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3089.62s)]
*  Did you see the decline in him then? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3091.74s)]
*  So that was one of the challenges is, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3093.58s)]
*  I didn't see it personally. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3095.2599999999998s)]
*  What I wish I had told him though, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3096.8599999999997s)]
*  because he asked me, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3098.22s)]
*  how do I win back younger voters? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3099.06s)]
*  What I wish I had told him, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3101.1s)]
*  which of course I would have been laughed at the room [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3102.62s)]
*  if I said this, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3104.14s)]
*  was that he shouldn't run for office again. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3105.4199999999996s)]
*  But that was the thing that should have been said. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3107.2599999999998s)]
*  I know, but that's what needed to be said. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3109.5s)]
*  I was saying that and everybody was so mad at me. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3111.18s)]
*  But that's part of the problem is, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3113.58s)]
*  we need to have a more open conversation [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3114.66s)]
*  about these things, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3116.22s)]
*  because we also created an environment [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3117.06s)]
*  where people felt like they were excommunicated [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3118.46s)]
*  if they dared to say anything about it. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3120.58s)]
*  And to some extent, I understand people were afraid [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3122.2999999999997s)]
*  about potentially re-electing Donald Trump, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3125.54s)]
*  but ultimately look at where we ended up. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3127.46s)]
*  That's right. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3129.14s)]
*  We need to build a culture inside of our party [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3129.98s)]
*  where we are telling people what they need to hear [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3132.54s)]
*  and not just what they wanna hear. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3134.3799999999997s)]
*  That's what I did when I ran for vice chair. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3135.7s)]
*  When I ran for this position, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3137.94s)]
*  I said, you know what I'm not gonna do? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3139.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm not gonna be a politician. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3141.9s)]
*  I'm not gonna contort myself into some pretzel [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3142.74s)]
*  of whatever you wanna see, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3144.94s)]
*  of some bulls**t mirage. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3145.94s)]
*  When they asked me, should Joe Biden have dropped out? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3147.94s)]
*  I said, yes, he should have, obviously. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3150.46s)]
*  And then when they asked me why we lost the election, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3153.38s)]
*  I said, why did we lose the election? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3155.06s)]
*  Voters told us two things. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3157.38s)]
*  They said prices are too high and Joe Biden is too old. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3158.7s)]
*  And we said to them, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3161.58s)]
*  with the power of $2 billion behind us, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3162.42s)]
*  no, he's not, yes, he is. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3164.02s)]
*  And then we said, no, they aren't. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3165.94s)]
*  Look at the stock market. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3167.3s)]
*  And majority of people don't have stocks. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3169.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3170.3799999999997s)]
*  And if you tell people not to believe their eyeballs [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3171.22s)]
*  or their wallets, you're gonna lose them. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3173.3399999999997s)]
*  And I think what we need to build in a party [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3175.58s)]
*  is a culture of addressing the realities [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3177.66s)]
*  that people are actually going through [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3179.8599999999997s)]
*  and what they're actually feeling. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3181.54s)]
*  Not just what a chart is telling us [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3182.94s)]
*  that they should be feeling, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3184.74s)]
*  but actually listening to them. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3185.98s)]
*  I'm just gonna throw some names at you [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3188.18s)]
*  because these people to me represent [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3190.02s)]
*  what the next generation of Democrats could look like. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3191.5s)]
*  I just wanna know what your thoughts of them are. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3193.7s)]
*  Governor Westmore, Maryland. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3195.94s)]
*  I think Governor Westmore has done a pretty amazing job. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3197.42s)]
*  He actually has a really cool program [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3199.86s)]
*  that I don't think has been talked about very much [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3201.42s)]
*  where he works, I think it's called [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3203.42s)]
*  the Mid-Career Program, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3205.46s)]
*  where they take in a class of several hundred young people [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3206.94s)]
*  and put them into different jobs [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3209.02s)]
*  around the state of Maryland. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3210.2200000000003s)]
*  And it really helps get them started in their lives [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3211.6600000000003s)]
*  and their careers and help turn things around. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3213.62s)]
*  And there've even been people [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3215.5s)]
*  that have gone into this program [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3216.34s)]
*  that I've heard about that started out literally homeless, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3217.3s)]
*  that now have gone on to get jobs and do things like that. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3220.98s)]
*  So that's great. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3223.26s)]
*  I love Governor Westmore. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3224.54s)]
*  I will say this much, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3226.66s)]
*  I can't talk at all about any potential presidential nominees. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3228.54s)]
*  I'm not saying that he is or is not running, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3233.54s)]
*  but I can't give any opinion specifically on that. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3235.2599999999998s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3237.8199999999997s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg clearly was a very good [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3238.8199999999997s)]
*  Secretary of Transportation [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3241.3799999999997s)]
*  given the situation that we're in right now. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3242.8199999999997s)]
*  And I think with Pete, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3245.7799999999997s)]
*  he represents a level of sanity [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3248.18s)]
*  that I think people are craving right now. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3250.98s)]
*  They're tired of the chaos [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3252.94s)]
*  that I think Donald Trump represents a lot of the time. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3254.34s)]
*  Pete, I don't think people wanna have a president [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3257.5400000000004s)]
*  that they have to hear about doing something ridiculous [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3259.5s)]
*  in the headlines every single day. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3261.5800000000004s)]
*  That is frankly an embarrassment to our country [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3263.34s)]
*  and internationally as well. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3265.7000000000003s)]
*  So I think Pete could be great. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3268.38s)]
*  What I really like about him is that, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3269.5s)]
*  and I'm just talking about like future leaders. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3272.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm not talking about anything about presidential [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3274.3s)]
*  or anything like that to be extremely clear. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3276.38s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3278.2200000000003s)]
*  This is the next generation [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3279.0600000000004s)]
*  of what a democratic nation looks like. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3279.9s)]
*  What I really like about him is I think [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3280.94s)]
*  he does an excellent job of talking to people [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3283.5s)]
*  who don't agree with him. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3285.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes, I agree. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3286.54s)]
*  That is what we need more of. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3287.78s)]
*  That's what I think Pete is really good at representing [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3289.02s)]
*  is helping to kind of bring people together [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3291.02s)]
*  and talk to the people that don't agree [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3292.7400000000002s)]
*  and explain without compromising his values [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3294.7400000000002s)]
*  what we believe as Democrats. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3296.94s)]
*  I think that's really powerful. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3298.66s)]
*  Few more names, Governor Josh Shapiro. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3299.7s)]
*  I think with Josh Shapiro, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3301.54s)]
*  he has a huge amount of favorability for a reason [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3302.58s)]
*  in Pennsylvania ultimately. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3306.1s)]
*  And I think it's interesting as a swing state, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3307.7400000000002s)]
*  they have a pretty close state legislature as well. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3310.38s)]
*  And there's been some great work [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3312.7s)]
*  that they've done on gun violence as well. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3314.06s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3316.18s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett, I love her. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3317.2599999999998s)]
*  She is amazing. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3318.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3320.02s)]
*  I think that people wanna see somebody who fights [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3320.8599999999997s)]
*  and calls out the ultimately. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3323.58s)]
*  I think that's what Jasmine does. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3325.46s)]
*  And we need a hell of a lot more people that are out there [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3326.94s)]
*  that are willing to do just that [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3328.8599999999997s)]
*  and call people out on the BS and not say, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3330.54s)]
*  oh my God, Republicans are gonna criticize me [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3332.22s)]
*  for saying this, screw that. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3334.22s)]
*  They're gonna criticize you no matter what. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3335.58s)]
*  So what we should be asking ourselves [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3337.74s)]
*  is what are we really fighting for? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3338.98s)]
*  Because we know it matters. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3340.3799999999997s)]
*  And I think Jasmine is frankly the type of leader [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3342.18s)]
*  that we're really looking to support in some senses. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3345.8199999999997s)]
*  Somebody who is out there that frankly doesn't give a damn [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3348.98s)]
*  with the other side, at least the elected Republicans [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3351.3399999999997s)]
*  in Congress say, that say what they believe in. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3354.54s)]
*  And at least you know, even if you don't agree with her, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3356.86s)]
*  you know what she stands for. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3358.98s)]
*  Because she makes it very clear. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3360.7s)]
*  Governor Gretchen Whitmer. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3362.3399999999997s)]
*  Part of what was really great with Gretchen Whitmer [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3363.5s)]
*  and her focus was on infrastructure. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3365.9s)]
*  People, I think Democrats need to do a lot more [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3368.5s)]
*  of finding the issues that nobody likes [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3372.94s)]
*  and addressing them in a substantial manner. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3374.74s)]
*  So part of her campaign was addressing potholes, right? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3376.22s)]
*  Really basic, just saying fix the damn roads. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3378.98s)]
*  We need more of that. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3382.02s)]
*  AOC. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3383.5s)]
*  I mean, AOC has been a huge inspiration to me. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3384.42s)]
*  What I really like about her is more than anything [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3387.54s)]
*  that you clearly know that she believes what she's saying. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3391.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3394.18s)]
*  And she knows how to communicate on social media [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3395.06s)]
*  because she grew up with it, she's young. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3397.46s)]
*  And also she doesn't, you know, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3399.66s)]
*  she's not out there taking money from special interests. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3401.7s)]
*  You know, regardless of whether or not you agree with AOC, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3403.66s)]
*  at least you can say that she's not owned by anyone. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3405.7s)]
*  My last name, these are people who I believe are the future [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3408.98s)]
*  and now in the future of the Democratic Party, John Stewart. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3412.02s)]
*  John Stewart. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3415.54s)]
*  John Stewart. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3416.3799999999997s)]
*  So what I love about John is I think he, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3417.3399999999997s)]
*  he and Donald Trump actually have the same greatest strength. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3420.8599999999997s)]
*  And this is gonna sound controversial. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3423.7s)]
*  It's that they're funny. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3425.22s)]
*  But I think with John Stewart, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3426.22s)]
*  what I like about him is the same thing [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3427.74s)]
*  that I like about AOC. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3429.18s)]
*  He's funny. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3430.3399999999997s)]
*  He says what he believes in and he gets done. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3431.62s)]
*  And I know that because I saw [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3435.9399999999996s)]
*  when they were working on the PACT Act. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3437.9399999999996s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3439.4199999999996s)]
*  That summer, they were, Democrats were working [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3440.2599999999998s)]
*  on passing the largest expansion of veterans healthcare. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3442.14s)]
*  One of those people that I met, you know, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3444.98s)]
*  had worked for the federal government [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3446.58s)]
*  and now he is facing a very real chance [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3447.62s)]
*  that his retirement is going to be cut by several hundred [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3449.62s)]
*  thousand dollars because of this bill [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3451.74s)]
*  that Republicans are pushing through right now. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3453.14s)]
*  And I will never forget when John Stewart showed up [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3455.26s)]
*  to support those veterans and help get that bill passed. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3458.34s)]
*  And it did get passed. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3460.86s)]
*  It's one of the largest expansions ever. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3461.94s)]
*  Yeah. It's my hope. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3464.1800000000003s)]
*  And I know you can't say this. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3465.7000000000003s)]
*  I want him to be president of the United States of America. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3466.86s)]
*  I really do. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3469.94s)]
*  I think that he is such a fantastic messenger [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3470.78s)]
*  and he actually knows politics and he cares about people. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3474.1000000000004s)]
*  And for the way the country is now [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3479.5s)]
*  and where the country is going as far as messaging, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3481.1400000000003s)]
*  you need somebody like him front and center. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3483.86s)]
*  That's my thought. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3487.86s)]

*  during the Diddy trial. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3604.02s)]
*  And here's just a quick recap. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3604.94s)]
*  Went down on the stand. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3607.9s)]
*  So a little bit of backstory. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3609.34s)]
*  Keh Cudi was dating Cassie in December 2011. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3610.98s)]
*  And he claimed that he didn't even know [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3613.6600000000003s)]
*  that they was still involved when he was dating her. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3616.06s)]
*  But then one day he got a phone call from Cassie, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3618.46s)]
*  like yo, he found out about us. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3620.2200000000003s)]
*  And he said, what? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3622.02s)]
*  Who was he? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3622.86s)]
*  So he turned out to be Diddy. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3623.7000000000003s)]
*  So, I know, right? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3625.1400000000003s)]
*  The Diddler. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3627.26s)]
*  So then apparently all hell broke loose, right? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3628.18s)]
*  Diddy alleged that Keh Cudi, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3630.54s)]
*  he got Keh Cudi's address from Cassie. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3632.46s)]
*  What? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3634.7s)]
*  And ABC News broke it down. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3635.54s)]
*  But before we get to the breakdown and everything, [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3636.98s)]
*  keep in mind, Keh Cudi's name is Scott Meskety. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3639.4199999999996s)]
*  That's what y'all gonna hear in this report. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3641.54s)]
*  Keh Cudi had dated Cassie Ventura. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3643.8999999999996s)]
*  And she testified that it made Shawn Combs [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3645.94s)]
*  jealous and angry. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3648.3799999999997s)]
*  Meskety testifying about an alleged break-in [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3650.8999999999996s)]
*  at his house in 2011, which he says was Combs, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3653.62s)]
*  showing up when he wasn't home. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3656.7799999999997s)]
*  Meskety testifying that he had a tense phone call [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3659.14s)]
*  with Combs, where Combs insinuates [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3661.66s)]
*  he was at Meskety's home. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3663.8599999999997s)]
*  I said, expletive, you in my house? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3665.9399999999996s)]
*  And he was like, what's up? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3668.4199999999996s)]
*  I was like, expletive, are you in my house? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3669.9799999999996s)]
*  And he said, I just wanna talk to you. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3672.2599999999998s)]
*  I was like, I'm on my way over right now. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3674.4599999999996s)]
*  He was like, I'm here. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3677.1s)]
*  When he arrived at Combs, he was not there. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3679.22s)]
*  But he said Christmas presents he had bought [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3681.5s)]
*  for members of his family were unwrapped, torn open, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3683.18s)]
*  and his dog was locked in the bathroom. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3687.58s)]
*  What? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3689.22s)]
*  Damn. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3690.06s)]

*  did he broke into the house, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3692.74s)]
*  but it was no signs of forced entry. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3693.74s)]
*  So it was like, yo, you just be having your door open [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3695.3399999999997s)]

*  But it was no signs of- [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3698.8999999999996s)]
*  Going in somebody's house and unwrapping Christmas presents [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3699.94s)]
*  and locking their dog in the bathroom [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3702.22s)]
*  is a different level of diabolical. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3703.58s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3705.18s)]
*  He's like a big ass kid. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3706.02s)]
*  Like, yo, I gotta re-wrap all this. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3707.3799999999997s)]
*  He didn't take anything. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3708.7799999999997s)]
*  He's like, this is trash. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3709.8599999999997s)]
*  Trash ass presents. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3711.14s)]
*  I'm gonna cut him. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3712.22s)]
*  I'm gonna cut him. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3713.7s)]
*  Ben had all of this. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3714.54s)]
*  He said it was Chanel bags when I watched yesterday's one. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3715.46s)]
*  Did he ever wonder? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3717.34s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3718.1800000000003s)]
*  He's like, trash ass presents. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3719.02s)]
*  I've been had all of this. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3719.94s)]
*  But you know what, Cutty said he was really mad [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3721.1400000000003s)]
*  because he said did he did something to his dog. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3722.86s)]
*  He said, what did Diddy do to the dog? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3724.5s)]
*  He just locked him in the bathroom. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3726.1s)]
*  Oh, just locked him in. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3727.46s)]
*  That was it. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3728.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3729.12s)]
*  They also caught the cut. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3729.96s)]
*  Diddy ain't that nasty now. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3730.8s)]
*  I know where you was going, but God damn. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3731.62s)]
*  I wasn't going there. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3733.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, if they would have said that, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3734.02s)]
*  he would have said that. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3735.1800000000003s)]
*  That's a different crime. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3736.02s)]
*  That's a whole another charge. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3736.86s)]
*  Oh, they'd have threw him under the jail. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3738.26s)]
*  What? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3739.34s)]
*  Listen, they'd have threw Diddy under the jail [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3740.3399999999997s)]
*  if they find out Diddy was out here diddling dogs. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3742.66s)]
*  I'm telling you right now. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3745.18s)]
*  Forget all the women. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3746.2999999999997s)]
*  I promise you, white America ain't gonna let you [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3747.14s)]
*  diddle no dogs. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3749.3799999999997s)]
*  A dog diddle is crazy. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3750.22s)]
*  I wasn't talking about diddling dogs. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3751.4199999999996s)]
*  Go ahead, Finn. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3753.02s)]
*  So they also covered the alleged car explosion. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3754.02s)]
*  ABC News recapped that too. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3756.22s)]
*  Meskady describing an alleged 2012 incident [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3758.02s)]
*  where his Porsche 911 convertible had been set on fire. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3760.8999999999996s)]
*  It looks like the top of my Porsche was cut open [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3764.7799999999997s)]
*  and that's where they inserted the Molotov cocktail. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3767.06s)]
*  Meskady testified. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3769.46s)]
*  Arson is part of the racketeering conspiracy [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3770.94s)]
*  count Combs faces. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3773.34s)]
*  Cassie Ventura previously testified [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3775.14s)]
*  that Combs threatened to have Kid Cudi's car blown up. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3777.1800000000003s)]
*  Kid Cudi's car fire has been talked about for years, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3780.62s)]
*  but it's significant now because federal prosecutors [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3785.06s)]
*  are trying to convince the jury that Sean Combs used Arson [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3788.78s)]
*  as part of a criminal enterprise. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3793.02s)]
*  That's one of the predicate acts [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3795.34s)]
*  of the racketeering conspiracy charge. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3796.82s)]
*  Now how did they know that it was Diddy [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3800.06s)]
*  with a Molotov cocktail in a Serov bottle? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3801.9399999999996s)]
*  Ha, funny. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3804.06s)]
*  They didn't get there. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3805.3799999999997s)]
*  But look, I just want to say, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3806.7s)]
*  not that I'm justifying that it's not a car explosion, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3809.1s)]
*  but when you hear a car explosion, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3813.1s)]
*  you think the car blew up like what Angela Bassett did [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3814.8599999999997s)]
*  on the way to her cell. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3818.18s)]
*  Nah, but a Molotov cocktail is not really like, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3819.3799999999997s)]
*  it's not like a bomb, like a bomb bomb. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3823.18s)]
*  Like the top is cut open. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3825.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't even know if you can call that a arson. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3827.14s)]
*  Well, if the fire gets to certain parts of the car, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3828.66s)]
*  it would have exploded, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3830.66s)]
*  but you can see that they put it out beforehand. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3831.7s)]
*  Yeah, the car did not explode though. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3834.02s)]
*  It's still arson though. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3836.06s)]
*  But it's the intent. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3836.9s)]
*  Definitely still, yeah, the intent. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3837.8199999999997s)]
*  But you know, the rumors that we've been hearing over the years, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3839.5s)]
*  I'm like, oh, right, yo, he really blew up this guy car. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3841.98s)]
*  I'm thinking about the whole actual car. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3844.54s)]
*  I'm thinking what you're next, Al, too. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3845.7s)]
*  I'm with you. Yeah, whole time. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3846.9s)]
*  All right, so then, oh, and I just do want to clarify. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3848.22s)]
*  I said that Diddy said that he got the address from Cassie. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3850.3399999999997s)]
*  No, Kid Cudi testified and said that Cassie gave Diddy [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3853.5s)]
*  his address. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3858.34s)]
*  All right, cool. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3859.2200000000003s)]
*  So after that happened, right, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3860.06s)]
*  they met up to have a man to man conversation at SoHo, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3862.06s)]
*  and this was the conversation. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3864.5s)]
*  Shortly after that alleged incident, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3866.02s)]
*  Meskity says he and Combs met at the SoHo house in Los Angeles. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3867.82s)]
*  He said he remembered walking into a room [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3871.7400000000002s)]
*  with all sorts of glass windows [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3874.26s)]
*  and Sean Combs staring out the window, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3876.5s)]
*  his hands behind his back, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3878.62s)]
*  looking like what Kid Cudi called a Marvel super villain. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3880.58s)]
*  But he said Combs' demeanor was very calm. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3884.58s)]
*  Meskity said he told Combs that Cassie told him [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3887.58s)]
*  she and Combs were broken up. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3890.46s)]
*  When the meeting ended, he says, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3892.3s)]
*  we stood up, shook hands, and as I was shaking his hand, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3893.66s)]
*  I said, what are we going to do about my car? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3896.62s)]
*  He looked right back at me, very cold stare, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3899.18s)]
*  and said, I don't know what you're talking about. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3902.2599999999998s)]
*  And remember, Cassie Ventura had sent her mom an email [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3904.66s)]
*  just before Christmas in 2011 [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3908.5s)]
*  saying that Combs had threatened to harm [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3910.86s)]
*  both her and Scott Meskity. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3914.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what, man, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3917.46s)]
*  I can't believe that y'all are calling Kid Cudi a snitch. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3918.78s)]
*  Like, Kid Cudi is not a street dude. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3921.54s)]
*  He's a law-abiding, taxpaying citizen. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3923.38s)]
*  I've seen him in a wedding dress before. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3926.98s)]
*  He wears mascara. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3928.82s)]
*  Like, man on the moon will absolutely turn to man [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3930.7400000000002s)]
*  on the stand, and there's nothing wrong with that. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3934.02s)]
*  The funniest thing about it is, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3937.02s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen the part [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3938.1400000000003s)]
*  where he was like, when I heard that, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3938.98s)]
*  I said, Diddy, let's meet up and fight. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3940.78s)]
*  And then he said, he thought about it, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3941.98s)]
*  and was like, nah, I don't want to fight. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3942.98s)]
*  I'm calling 911. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3944.0600000000004s)]
*  And then he called 911 to say, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3944.9s)]
*  somebody just blew up my car. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3946.26s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3947.9s)]
*  He's a civilian. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3948.7400000000002s)]
*  He's a civilian. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3949.5800000000004s)]
*  So then after all that, Kid Cudi claims [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3950.42s)]
*  that he realized that he got played by the both of them. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3951.9s)]
*  And Lauren was in court yesterday, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3954.94s)]
*  and she said, Kid Cudi had a calm demeanor [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3956.0600000000004s)]
*  the whole entire time. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3957.7400000000002s)]
*  And then yesterday after court, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=3959.38s)]

*  He said he will never let fake rumors about his name [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4106.46s)]
*  or manhood linger and be silent, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4109.66s)]
*  but his son had to see all of this ish play out [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4111.1s)]

*  in regards to the whole Diddy, Cassie thing, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4125.9800000000005s)]
*  listening to the Kid Cudi testimony. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4128.02s)]
*  When you're Diddy, why would you crash out [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4130.46s)]
*  over a person you just smutting out? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4132.54s)]
*  Like you got other men smashing them. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4136.42s)]
*  You letting them get passed around, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4138.5s)]
*  but on the flip side, you mad she's sleeping [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4139.820000000001s)]
*  with other men. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4141.660000000001s)]

*  he could only have her. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4144.46s)]
*  So he mad that she didn't let him watch her and Cudi? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4146.46s)]
*  Yeah, like I think- [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4148.98s)]
*  Mad it wasn't the Punisher. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4150.18s)]
*  He would have to be supervised. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4151.22s)]

*  these sexual freak offs if she's doing it. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4154.62s)]
*  Like she can't go out and have somebody by herself. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4157.7s)]
*  Diddy gotta be supervised. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4159.74s)]
*  I just don't understand why you would be crashing out [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4161.14s)]

*  I don't understand that. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4176.62s)]
*  I also think it was who it was, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4177.740000000001s)]
*  is the fact that these other gentlemen were in the industry. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4179.1s)]
*  Remember he allegedly got mad and that she was, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4181.42s)]

*  It's Zah from the Bronx, Zahisha. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4228.26s)]
*  You know the craziest people in America [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4230.9400000000005s)]
*  come from the Bronx and all of Florida. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4232.22s)]
*  So who you want to get the biggest he-haw to, Zah? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4233.46s)]
*  It's two of them, Pat and Remy, both of them. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4235.46s)]
*  I'm mad at them. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4237.9800000000005s)]
*  Why is they doing this? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4238.900000000001s)]
*  Putting their business online like this. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4240.38s)]
*  Going back and forth with each other. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4242.7s)]
*  Remy is kind of blowing her own spot up. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4244.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm from the Bronx, I'm always team woman, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4247.18s)]
*  but Remy already said, [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4249.66s)]
*  before he even said he was writing her rhymes, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4251.74s)]
*  that he was going to say that. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4254.58s)]
*  So he already said, be left the spot. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4256.7s)]
*  Pat, you going back and forth about Clarissa [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4259.5s)]
*  because you in love now, they just doing the most. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4262.78s)]
*  It's just a show, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4264.9s)]
*  it's seeming like they trying to compete with Artie [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4265.74s)]
*  and what was his name? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4268.22s)]
*  Offset. Offset. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4270.22s)]
*  Yeah, it just seemed like a competition. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4271.3s)]
*  It's just too much, it seemed like a show. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4274.02s)]
*  I wish that Pat would, that's it. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4275.62s)]
*  He said what he had to say now, fall back, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4277.78s)]
*  because then that would prove his point. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4279.78s)]
*  Well, let me ask you a question. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4282.34s)]
*  Should we blame the Bronx for this? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4283.18s)]
*  Because you know, the crazy people in America [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4284.62s)]
*  do come from the Bronx and all of Florida. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4287.58s)]
*  Do we blame the Bronx? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4289.259999999999s)]
*  Does the Bronx get any blame? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4290.099999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4291.46s)]
*  Does the Bronx get any blame? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4292.299999999999s)]
*  I want to say the Bronx, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4294.259999999999s)]
*  I would just say emotions as women, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4295.62s)]
*  all women from all over get stupid like that. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4298.219999999999s)]
*  We're Cardi, oh, Cardi from the Bronx too. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4300.74s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4302.74s)]

*  Okay, we're going to go back to another point. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4304.98s)]
*  Jess Hoey, yo. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4307.259999999999s)]

*  Justin from the DMV. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4317.58s)]
*  Hey, who you want to get the biggest he-haw to, Justin? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4319.46s)]
*  The UPS, my job. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4320.46s)]
*  Oh, okay, talk to me. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4322.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, they fired a guy for being racist and sexist, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4323.7s)]
*  but they have a slogan, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4327.74s)]
*  like a banister that says not in our house, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4329.78s)]
*  and it says that stuff in the banister, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4331.9s)]
*  but then they hired him back. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4334.7s)]
*  So I just think that's just the biggest donkey, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4335.98s)]
*  in my opinion. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4338.66s)]
*  Oh, okay, but UPS is a great job. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4339.5s)]
*  Is there going to be any backlash to you [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4342.5s)]
*  for getting on the radio and calling him donkey of the day? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4344.18s)]
*  The guy got his job back. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4347.58s)]
*  It shouldn't be. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4348.86s)]
*  It shouldn't even came from me. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4349.7s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4351.42s)]
*  What's up, Jess? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4352.38s)]
*  What's up, baby? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4353.22s)]
*  Salute to all of you. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4354.14s)]

*  It's also not so, you know, every week news headline. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4708.5s)]
*  It's more so evergreen. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4711.9800000000005s)]
*  Things that are happening in the news, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4713.22s)]
*  but things that we can talk about over the course of time [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4715.1s)]
*  because they affect us every day. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4717.42s)]
*  And just giving people more tools, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4719.22s)]
*  I feel like on social media, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4721.3s)]
*  I've always tried to be more information heavy [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4722.9s)]
*  and just provide a positive outlook. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4726.42s)]
*  But now that we got more time, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4728.379999999999s)]
*  we want to try to provide resources too, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4729.46s)]
*  and answers to questions and not just complaints. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4731.82s)]
*  How different is it from Parking Lot Pimping? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4734.7s)]
*  I won't say it's too different. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4737.74s)]
*  I still get to say what I want to say. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4739.0199999999995s)]
*  We, what, TV 14, so less cussing, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4741.179999999999s)]
*  but the team over there want to do what I want to do. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4743.86s)]
*  And that's like give everybody the truth and be helpful. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4747.9s)]
*  We kind of take the same, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4753.74s)]
*  oh, doctors do no harm in as much as we can. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4754.58s)]
*  Yeah, the tone is the same, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4758.34s)]
*  but it's really cool because it's not, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4759.7s)]
*  it's newsy, but it's not, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4761.78s)]
*  I never take in a traditional approach to things. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4763.179999999999s)]
*  So it's like a mix of 60 minutes and tonight [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4765.42s)]
*  with John Oliver, The Daily Show, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4769.219999999999s)]
*  a little bit of Amber Ruffin, but with me. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4771.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4773.7s)]
*  It was well-rounded. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4774.54s)]
*  It's very well-rounded. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4775.36s)]
*  We have a lot of fun. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4776.2s)]
*  The first couple episodes, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4777.04s)]
*  the first episode this week, Tuesday, [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4777.86s)]
*  and I had Angela Rhyon as my first guest. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4780.219999999999s)]
*  That was amazing. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4782.34s)]
*  With my good sister, Angela Rhyon? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4783.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4784.58s)]
*  We get to get out in the field, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4785.42s)]
*  do some man on the street, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4786.7s)]
*  but a lot of good people come through [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4787.78s)]
*  and we have a lot of fun. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4789.54s)]
*  Do you write from a place of anger or hope or exhaustion? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4790.9400000000005s)]
*  All three of them. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4797.02s)]
*  And it's funny you say that. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4797.900000000001s)]
*  Did y'all see Inside Out too? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4798.82s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4800.46s)]
*  No, not too. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4801.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4802.14s)]
*  Boy, love Inside Out. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4802.9800000000005s)]
*  If you've seen them, then you get the concept. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4803.82s)]
*  I had my friends say like, who's at our leaderboard? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4805.18s)]
*  And everybody said my top three are anger, disgust, and joy. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4807.82s)]
*  Because of the way that I see things. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4810.82s)]
*  I'm real big on character above anything [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4813.5s)]
*  and the way you contribute to society above anything. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4816.099999999999s)]
*  So more often than not, I'm disgusted. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4818.98s)]
*  And more often than not, that makes me exhausted. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4821.34s)]
*  And a lot of things make me angry, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4823.299999999999s)]
*  but I also think anger is about emotion [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4824.94s)]
*  and it doesn't always have to present [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4827.179999999999s)]
*  in a way that is heavy. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4828.54s)]
*  It's just what it is. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4830.74s)]
*  I'm a black woman in America. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4832.0199999999995s)]
*  A lot of things make me upset [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4833.42s)]
*  and I should be able to say that [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4835.34s)]
*  without being made to feel like I have to cover up [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4836.66s)]
*  my emotions in any particular way. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4839.0599999999995s)]
*  But I think the method of storytelling we use [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4841.200000000001s)]
*  combines all those things in a beautiful way [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4843.72s)]
*  that also shows that we're more than our anger, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4846.400000000001s)]
*  we're more than our joy, we're more than our exhaustion, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4848.64s)]
*  we're more than our disgust. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4850.400000000001s)]
*  And we can be all things at one time [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4851.360000000001s)]
*  and still be full functioning members of society. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4852.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4855.6s)]
*  How did you end up at Revolt? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4856.4400000000005s)]
*  How did that happen? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4857.360000000001s)]
*  You know, good people speak in my name in good rooms. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4858.320000000001s)]
*  I've been very blessed to have a good team [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4861.88s)]
*  no matter what I'm working on [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4864.120000000001s)]
*  and they've been fighting for me in different rooms. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4865.4400000000005s)]
*  I've been pitching different versions of shows, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4867.52s)]
*  whether it's scripted, unscripted for the past five years [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4869.32s)]
*  and nothing's just been the right fit. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4871.96s)]
*  But as I said, I've been in tune with the Lord [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4874.36s)]
*  and he told me at the end of the last year [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4877.08s)]
*  to stop trying to force things [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4879.4s)]
*  and to just put stuff down and let him work. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4880.96s)]
*  And so as I said, okay, wasn't even expecting it. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4883.8s)]
*  Two weeks later, I got a call and said, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4886.639999999999s)]
*  Revolt wants to give you a show. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4887.84s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4889.24s)]
*  Wow. Okay. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4890.08s)]
*  And my hands were open so I was ready to receive it. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4891.32s)]
*  So that's how we ended up together. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4893.8s)]
*  Oh, I wonder for somebody like you, Lene, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4895.84s)]
*  what do you do when you feel like your words aren't enough? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4897.6s)]
*  I don't feel like my words aren't enough. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4900.04s)]
*  I feel like I do what I'm supposed to do [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4902.0s)]
*  and I'm okay with that. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4903.96s)]
*  My contribution, as long as I do my best, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4905.400000000001s)]
*  I'm okay with that, whatever the result is, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4908.52s)]
*  because whatever I was supposed to contribute [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4910.280000000001s)]
*  is all I was supposed to contribute [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4912.52s)]
*  because it's not just up to me, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4913.76s)]
*  it's not just up to anybody. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4915.160000000001s)]
*  Like we all put in, we all have a piece to the puzzle [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4916.400000000001s)]
*  to create the fuller picture [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4919.72s)]
*  and sometimes it may feel like [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4921.280000000001s)]
*  it didn't hit the way it was supposed to hit, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4923.76s)]
*  but you gotta give things time. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4926.0s)]
*  Like the seeds you sow always have their time for harvest [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4927.32s)]
*  and I've just learned to be content and patient [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4931.12s)]
*  with my contribution. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4933.04s)]
*  So sometimes you feel like it's like a call to action almost, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4934.32s)]
*  like you might activate the person [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4937.36s)]
*  who might go out there and actually get active. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4939.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely what I feel like my lane is. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4942.44s)]
*  I feel like my job is to impart information, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4945.2s)]
*  to bring as many people to the table as possible, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4947.76s)]
*  to make them invested, to make them excited. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4949.64s)]
*  And those are the people that go out [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4952.24s)]
*  and do something with it. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4953.84s)]
*  Even when I left my master's program, [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4954.68s)]
*  my professors told me I was only gonna be able [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4957.04s)]
*  to make money or make a life for myself [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4959.12s)]
*  if I continue to get my PhD. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4960.6s)]
*  And that's not what I felt called to do. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4962.52s)]
*  I immediately wanted to go and share with very young people [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4964.16s)]
*  all the things that I learned in my program [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4967.4400000000005s)]
*  that I had to pay $25,000 and take out loans [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4968.84s)]
*  to get with all these real stuffy people [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4971.72s)]
*  that may not have the best methods [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4975.08s)]
*  as far as connecting with the general public. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4977.6s)]
*  But I was like, if I can impart this in high school students, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4979.84s)]
*  they can apply to college, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4982.4800000000005s)]
*  they can go on career paths that with the knowledge, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4984.08s)]
*  with a fuller knowledge of their capacity and ability [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4987.88s)]
*  and vocabulary and nuance to be change agents. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4990.36s)]
*  So that's all I've ever wanted to do. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4993.96s)]
*  And that's what I'm doing. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4995.92s)]
*  And I'm grateful for that. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4996.76s)]
*  And as a Spelman grad, congratulations, I love that. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=4997.8s)]
*  What part of that HBCU experience has shaped your voice? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5001.44s)]
*  Well, at Spelman, we got a saying, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5006.28s)]
*  it's my choice and I choose to change the world. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5008.36s)]
*  And it's funny, I've said this, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5010.6s)]
*  I've told this story so many times, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5012.48s)]
*  but when I was first applying, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5014.12s)]
*  I had teachers at my high school telling me [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5015.599999999999s)]
*  they didn't think I should go. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5017.799999999999s)]
*  They didn't think that I would get in [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5019.12s)]
*  because it was too expensive that it wasn't the real world. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5020.759999999999s)]
*  But we shouldn't be encouraging our kids en masse [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5023.2s)]
*  to go to school, to learn how to plug in [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5027.719999999999s)]
*  to the way things already exist. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5030.759999999999s)]
*  Like we need to be disruptors, we need to be change agents. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5032.799999999999s)]
*  And that's what my HBCU did for me. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5035.2s)]
*  I was a psychology student, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5037.959999999999s)]
*  but every single class you take, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5039.28s)]
*  whether it's the biology of women, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5040.76s)]
*  whether it's math, finite math or whatever, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5043.280000000001s)]
*  computer science, you take it [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5045.76s)]
*  through the lens of black feminism. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5046.96s)]
*  And so we have a vantage point [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5049.12s)]
*  that allows us to see everybody's pain. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5050.72s)]
*  And it just makes us, that's why we be the best, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5053.08s)]
*  advocates for the job most of the time, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5056.08s)]
*  most suited for the job most of the time [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5058.8s)]
*  because we see people. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5060.280000000001s)]
*  And so my HBCU experience really allowed me [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5061.72s)]
*  to see what people need in order to feel seen. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5064.68s)]
*  And I try to put that in my storytelling as well. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5067.320000000001s)]
*  How do you navigate being both a political educator [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5070.44s)]
*  but also a cultural influencer [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5075.44s)]
*  in an algorithm driven world? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5078.68s)]
*  Well, politics was never my game. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5080.6s)]
*  It was never my choice. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5082.6s)]
*  You couldn't touch me with politics with a 10 foot pole. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5083.8s)]
*  It just became necessary. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5086.5599999999995s)]
*  So like I said, I've always been driven by what's necessary. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5088.0s)]
*  And I started this work to really be steeped in pop culture [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5090.5199999999995s)]
*  and connect that through to history, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5093.8s)]
*  through an interdisciplinary lens. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5097.24s)]
*  But as I began, I started in 2020. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5098.72s)]
*  So politics was just like thrust upon us in a real way. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5101.08s)]
*  And so I challenged myself to say like, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5105.04s)]
*  okay, I know that we need to understand this. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5106.92s)]
*  So how can I incorporate this into what I do? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5109.84s)]
*  And it just became even more and more and more necessary. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5111.84s)]
*  So I just think because I speak to people, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5114.4400000000005s)]
*  like we cousins, like we family, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5117.400000000001s)]
*  because I don't try to hit people over the head with it. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5118.88s)]
*  And because I let myself feel all the things [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5120.92s)]
*  like a regular person feels, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5123.400000000001s)]
*  the algorithm can't beat the content that I'm putting out. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5125.28s)]
*  Yeah, like I draw people regardless [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5129.639999999999s)]
*  and people sharing it in their family group chats, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5131.759999999999s)]
*  grandmas and aunties and kids in seventh grade [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5134.04s)]
*  and high school students all like talking about [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5136.719999999999s)]
*  what was on the parking lot this week. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5138.8s)]
*  And I'm really grateful for that [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5140.0s)]
*  because it's not about me and my parking lot. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5141.92s)]
*  It's really about the information being shared. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5144.12s)]
*  So I'm grateful for the anointing that's been put on me [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5145.96s)]
*  that's allowed no matter what's changed [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5149.599999999999s)]
*  in the social media landscape, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5151.8s)]
*  people to come to the parking lot every Friday. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5153.08s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Lenev Vanee. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5155.0s)]
*  She has a show on revolt, Charlamagne. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5156.44s)]
*  What's one political issue you think [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5158.68s)]
*  just we've become too performative about [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5160.12s)]
*  and not solution oriented enough about? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5162.2s)]
*  I think it's sustaining period, sustainability period [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5164.96s)]
*  in terms of how we organize, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5168.36s)]
*  in terms of how we fight back against political oppression [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5169.68s)]
*  because we often wait the four year cycle [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5172.36s)]
*  to begin to complain about [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5175.68s)]
*  what we don't like about candidates. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5177.04s)]
*  And then are upset when we're not able to show up [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5178.76s)]
*  in full force and vote together. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5182.68s)]
*  And that make a difference. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5185.52s)]
*  I don't think that we give ourselves the opportunity [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5186.400000000001s)]
*  for our work to actually for our work [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5188.52s)]
*  to return to us in a good way, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5190.4800000000005s)]
*  because unfortunately a lot of times [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5192.04s)]
*  we are motivated by rage and sadness [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5194.280000000001s)]
*  and we wanna get active when things hit close to home, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5196.96s)]
*  but something is always hitting close to home for everybody. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5200.12s)]
*  And if we don't learn to act as a community [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5202.4800000000005s)]
*  and have the sort of sustain. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5205.2s)]
*  Garrison Hayes said in a segment of my episode [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5206.72s)]
*  this past Tuesday, he said, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5209.92s)]
*  these people don't let up. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5212.0s)]
*  They've been strategizing, they don't stop strategizing. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5213.84s)]
*  So why should we? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5215.92s)]
*  Especially if we're already playing catch up, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5217.32s)]
*  it's never a day when we should just be like, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5219.4s)]
*  oh, the struggle will be here tomorrow, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5221.16s)]
*  but that means you should also be strategizing for tomorrow. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5223.32s)]
*  And it's not to say that your life [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5226.08s)]
*  has to be completely shaped by that. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5227.88s)]
*  Cause I say often, I don't, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5230.68s)]
*  my friends think I'm single now [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5232.8s)]
*  and they're like, so what you want? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5235.32s)]
*  Like I'm Mark Lamont Hill. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5236.16s)]
*  No, like no shade to Mark, he's great, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5237.28s)]
*  but I don't need that to encompass my entire life. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5239.36s)]
*  Like I'm still a human being. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5242.4s)]
*  So I'm not saying that you gotta live, breathe, die, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5243.719999999999s)]
*  fight the power, but you do have to have some things [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5247.44s)]
*  ingrained in the way that you move about your day, period, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5250.24s)]
*  to understand that the work never stops. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5253.48s)]
*  So we just gotta find that balance. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5255.679999999999s)]
*  And for you, I want somebody who knows [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5256.84s)]
*  that women can have babies. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5259.24s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5261.799999999999s)]
*  Only women can have babies. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5262.639999999999s)]
*  I just wanna let you know that. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5263.48s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5264.84s)]
*  There are other people who can have babies. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5265.679999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5267.08s)]
*  I mean, if they have a uterus, they can have babies, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5268.2s)]
*  but they just might not identify as women. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5270.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5272.32s)]
*  Those are two different things. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5273.16s)]
*  Like you can be biologically female, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5274.0s)]
*  but you can't be biologically woman. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5275.92s)]
*  Woman is a gender construct, a social construct. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5277.84s)]
*  If you have a uterus, yeah, you can have a baby. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5282.12s)]
*  Yes, that's the point. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5283.6s)]
*  If you have a uterus, you can have a baby. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5284.72s)]
*  Okay, cool. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5286.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, we agree on that. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5287.32s)]
*  You know, Lene, has the Democratic Party [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5288.32s)]
*  tried to co-op your platform or message yet? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5292.2s)]
*  Cause I was reading this article [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5294.2s)]
*  in the New York Times yesterday [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5295.04s)]
*  and it was the headline is Democrats throw money [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5296.32s)]
*  at a problem, but it basically is out there paying influences [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5299.0s)]
*  and they're trying to figure out how to utilize the internet [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5302.4s)]
*  and you know, deliver messaging. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5304.639999999999s)]
*  I think they are late in the game. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5306.04s)]
*  I think people gotta understand is Republicans [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5307.4s)]
*  have been using people with a microphone for years [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5310.24s)]
*  to just disseminate misinformation. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5312.96s)]
*  So it's not even like, that's not a tool [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5315.08s)]
*  that shouldn't be used [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5317.12s)]
*  because we do have to have some opposition. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5318.04s)]
*  They haven't tried to buy me. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5320.44s)]
*  No, I only talk to people I wanna talk to. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5322.759999999999s)]
*  Like there's no amount of money. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5324.679999999999s)]
*  There's no check that just would make me wanna like [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5326.64s)]
*  jump on the bandwagon, especially because I have critiques. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5328.56s)]
*  I gotta be able to say whatever I wanna say. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5330.92s)]
*  And the Democratic Party definitely got some things [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5333.4s)]
*  that need to be worked on. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5336.36s)]
*  I had the honor of working with some good people in the CBC [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5338.04s)]
*  and that's the other thing, like we live in America. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5341.12s)]
*  There's no institution that's got it right [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5343.72s)]
*  or has always had it right from jump. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5345.24s)]
*  So I don't sit here and act like, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5346.6s)]
*  I absolutely have to agree with something a body has done [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5349.24s)]
*  since its conception. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5352.84s)]
*  But if I'm working with people who I understand [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5354.24s)]
*  are genuine in their efforts, like I'm down with that. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5356.28s)]
*  Because like I said, I'm trying to be solution oriented [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5358.76s)]
*  and do no harm in as much as I can. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5361.44s)]
*  And you mentioned Garrison early. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5363.44s)]
*  I like Garrison a lot too. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5365.4s)]
*  Have y'all ever thought about being in policy? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5366.92s)]
*  You, the Garrisons of the world? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5369.32s)]
*  Not me. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5370.96s)]
*  I'm not sure what Garrison has planned. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5373.5199999999995s)]
*  I have met some influencers who are interested in that work. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5375.2s)]
*  I just don't think it's personally my calling. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5377.639999999999s)]
*  Why? Why'd you say that? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5379.44s)]
*  I think my role is to inspire [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5380.639999999999s)]
*  and my role is to work alongside when we look at people [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5384.400000000001s)]
*  who have been a part of our story [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5387.4800000000005s)]
*  as far as black history goes. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5388.72s)]
*  We got people in every industry. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5390.32s)]
*  And I think we forget that it's not just about politics. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5391.8s)]
*  It's also about who is singing songs. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5394.08s)]
*  It's also about who's acting on TV screens [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5396.8s)]
*  because even like the Breakfast Club, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5398.4400000000005s)]
*  who's listening to you guys speak every day. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5399.84s)]
*  Like we all have a role in getting people engaged [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5401.76s)]
*  in the process. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5403.92s)]
*  And we have to be in the marketplace in mass [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5404.76s)]
*  and in different ways to be able to exercise enough influence [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5408.24s)]
*  to get people focused back in on the problem. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5411.16s)]
*  So I'm just one of those people. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5413.04s)]
*  And I consider myself more of an artist than anything. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5414.64s)]
*  A storyteller, as I said, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5418.6s)]
*  I'm getting back into my poetry and spoken word, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5420.32s)]
*  but that's what I feel called and set to do. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5422.5199999999995s)]
*  When you were at Spelman, what was your major? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5425.48s)]
*  Psychology. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5427.28s)]
*  Oh, you wanted to be a therapist, a psychiatrist? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5428.32s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5429.5199999999995s)]
*  I wanted to understand people. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5430.5199999999995s)]
*  Ooh. Yeah. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5432.2s)]
*  So you major in psychology [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5433.5199999999995s)]
*  just to be able to understand people. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5434.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5435.6s)]
*  Dope. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5436.44s)]
*  What did you want to understand about people exactly? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5437.36s)]
*  Behavior, what drives behavior. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5440.68s)]
*  And also what affects behavior. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5442.839999999999s)]
*  And you find out, you know, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5444.08s)]
*  one of the biggest arguments is nature versus nurture. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5446.5599999999995s)]
*  And you just find out all the things [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5448.679999999999s)]
*  that contextualize those two things, [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5449.919999999999s)]
*  whether it's your upbringing, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5451.599999999999s)]
*  whether it's like things you might inherit. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5452.5199999999995s)]
*  Also like what socioeconomic stressors [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5455.12s)]
*  that have affected your family long-term [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5457.719999999999s)]
*  that can result in yield and specific behaviors [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5459.4s)]
*  or even psychotic breaks or what have you. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5462.32s)]
*  Don't have to get too deep into that kind of stuff. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5465.4s)]
*  But at the end of the day, and I also was a person, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5467.719999999999s)]
*  I grew up in the deep South Baptist. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5470.84s)]
*  I didn't really understand that much about therapy. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5473.400000000001s)]
*  And I remember in one of my first classes, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5475.28s)]
*  I was like, yeah, that's cool and all. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5476.68s)]
*  I want to learn about bipolar disorder, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5479.0s)]
*  but like black people don't really get that right. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5480.4800000000005s)]
*  And it was like, no girl, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5482.52s)]
*  we all are exposed to these sort of things. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5483.92s)]
*  But anyway, I think at the end of the day, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5486.96s)]
*  it just really helped me understand emotions. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5488.92s)]
*  And like I said, the validity of them [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5492.84s)]
*  and giving them space to exist [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5494.64s)]
*  and what can trigger you and what can't. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5496.2s)]
*  And then also how outside stressors like race, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5498.839999999999s)]
*  like gender, like sexuality or whatever, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5502.88s)]
*  also contribute to a person's wellbeing. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5505.12s)]
*  And I think saying it right now, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5507.799999999999s)]
*  I think what I just want most [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5509.799999999999s)]
*  is for black people to be well, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5510.96s)]
*  no matter what you look like, no matter who you with, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5512.4s)]
*  no matter how you move throughout your life. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5514.5199999999995s)]
*  I want us to be well, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5515.599999999999s)]
*  and I want us to be invested in the wellness of one another [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5516.44s)]
*  because the object and goal of oppression [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5518.599999999999s)]
*  is to make us sick, to make us distracted. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5520.839999999999s)]
*  And if we are focused on one another's wellness [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5522.839999999999s)]
*  and wholeness, then we can be stronger than ever. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5526.16s)]
*  What's the moment where you realized [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5529.04s)]
*  your influence was having real world consequences? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5530.2s)]
*  For better or worse? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5533.04s)]
*  Real world consequences, honestly, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5534.4s)]
*  because I started during the pandemic, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5536.8s)]
*  we was all inside, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5537.96s)]
*  so I didn't get to really get to see people. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5538.8s)]
*  But when we started to trickle back outside, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5540.48s)]
*  and unfortunately Atlanta was among the first [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5542.32s)]
*  to get back outside, [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5545.4s)]
*  when people started meeting me and just like crying, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5546.28s)]
*  like talking about like how either [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5549.08s)]
*  I changed their perspective on something [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5551.36s)]
*  or I helped heal a relationship in their family, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5552.88s)]
*  or even really what it was, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5555.12s)]
*  I think I was invited to speak somewhere at a school [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5557.4s)]
*  and an older woman about 60 years old, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5559.5199999999995s)]
*  she took me to the side and she thanked me [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5561.4s)]
*  for saying things she never got to say when she was my age. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5564.36s)]
*  That was really beautiful. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5567.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5568.84s)]
*  Well, Lenevonee hosted a People's Brief [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5569.72s)]
*  every Tuesday at 9 p.m. on Revolt, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5572.08s)]
*  and I guess we get parking lot pimping when we can. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5574.04s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5576.04s)]
*  Where do they follow you at? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5576.88s)]
*  You can follow me everywhere at Lenevonee. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5578.96s)]
*  You can tap into the show on Revolt TV. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5580.96s)]
*  You can also watch us at 11 a.m. the next day on streaming, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5583.36s)]

*  You need to tell them to send it to you. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5629.2s)]
*  But anyway, we have a lot to get into [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5630.28s)]
*  because it's a lot going on in the rap world right now. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5632.12s)]
*  People online are calling it Joey versus the West Coast, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5635.04s)]
*  Joey versus 20. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5638.12s)]
*  Joey's been rapping. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5639.48s)]
*  Joey has been rapping and I've been here for it. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5640.96s)]
*  I really been enjoying this battle. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5643.56s)]
*  So let's kick it off. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5646.46s)]
*  I'm gonna just do the most recent records from them. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5647.46s)]
*  Tell the people who the battle is for those who don't know. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5649.86s)]
*  The battle, I mean. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5652.3s)]
*  It's really Joey Badass versus Ray Vaughn. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5653.38s)]
*  Is that what you narrowing it down to? [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5655.3s)]
*  That's how it started. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5656.7s)]
*  Yes, well it was really, it started in December [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5657.74s)]
*  with Joey kinda coming at Kendrick. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5660.5s)]
*  Like this whole time Joey is really trying [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5662.38s)]
*  to get at Kendrick. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5664.14s)]
*  Joey Badass. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5665.22s)]
*  Kendrick is not responding. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5666.1s)]
*  You know, Kendrick's on tour with SZA, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5667.38s)]
*  minding his business. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5668.94s)]
*  Ray Vaughn, who's from LA and TD. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5670.68s)]
*  Yes, Ray Vaughn has responded, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5672.88s)]
*  but Reason has also responded as well. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5674.52s)]
*  Did Reason have a reason? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5677.64s)]
*  Everybody's reason is they gotta rep the West. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5678.76s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5681.400000000001s)]
*  You know, people, it's getting like, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5682.240000000001s)]
*  not territorial, regional. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5684.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so regional rap is back. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5686.080000000001s)]
*  And let's start with Joey Badass, Crash Demi. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5687.76s)]
*  You know why this is good? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5690.320000000001s)]
*  Because all this reminded me was, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5691.240000000001s)]
*  damn, I used to really like Joey Badass. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5693.320000000001s)]
*  And it's not like I dislike him now. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5695.4400000000005s)]
*  I just haven't heard of a project in a while. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5698.78s)]
*  I think the last thing he put out was 2000. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5700.46s)]
*  And you like that project. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5702.58s)]
*  I like All-American Badass. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5703.74s)]
*  I like 1999, 2000. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5706.0199999999995s)]
*  I like Joey Badass as an artist. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5707.0199999999995s)]
*  But then- Joey Badass gets busy. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5708.54s)]
*  He got into his acting bag. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5709.78s)]
*  But this just reminded me like, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5710.78s)]
*  yo, Joey, he can rap. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5711.94s)]
*  Joey can rap. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5713.58s)]
*  Now I felt like that last week too, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5714.42s)]
*  when I saw the Ab Soul freestyle with him and Big Sean. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5715.54s)]
*  That was dope too. Yeah, the Red Bull Cipher. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5717.86s)]
*  Was fire. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5719.5s)]
*  Somebody else from the West. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5720.38s)]
*  As long as it stays on record. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5721.3s)]
*  As long as it stays like this. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5722.98s)]
*  That was funny though, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5724.5s)]
*  when Joey said that there's some guy [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5725.34s)]
*  named Asscheeks coming to him. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5727.72s)]
*  Hey yo. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5729.12s)]
*  That was hilarious. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5729.96s)]
*  Yeah, but now- [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5730.8s)]
*  When you look at the name, you like AZ Cheeks. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5731.62s)]
*  If you don't say AZ Cheeks, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5733.36s)]
*  it does look like it could be Asscheeks. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5734.68s)]
*  But now Ray Vaughn's trying to insinuate [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5736.44s)]
*  that like Joey Badass is gay [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5740.36s)]
*  because of his partying with Diddy. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5741.96s)]
*  I mean- That's hip hop. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5745.24s)]
*  Let's get into it. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5746.8s)]
*  This is Ray Vaughn's Golden Eye. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5747.62s)]
*  Can't call it- That's hard. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5749.76s)]
*  Yeah, can't call it Golden Eye. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5750.6s)]
*  If he said he's standing next to Diddy, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5751.68s)]
*  he should have called it Brown Eye. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5753.12s)]
*  That's Asscheeks. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5754.16s)]
*  No, no, no, that's not it. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5755.44s)]
*  His name's not Asscheeks. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5756.78s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5758.9s)]
*  Ray Vaughn Hard. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5759.74s)]
*  The Good, the Bad, the Something. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5760.58s)]
*  That album is dope. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5761.42s)]
*  The Good, the Bad, the Dollar Menu. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5762.259999999999s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5763.099999999999s)]
*  The Good, the Bad, the Dollar Menu. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5763.92s)]
*  Yes it is. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5765.219999999999s)]
*  Ray Vaughn album is dope too. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5766.0599999999995s)]
*  I just want to highlight Kai Cash [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5767.5s)]
*  because this was actually a really, really fire freestyle [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5769.3s)]
*  that he wrote. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5772.34s)]
*  One, two, he's actually from New York [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5773.179999999999s)]
*  because people are saying it's just Joey. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5775.259999999999s)]
*  When it's not just Joey, there's other spitters. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5777.139999999999s)]
*  And I think Kai did the best. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5779.04s)]
*  And he dropped nicks in the sixth of the day [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5780.3s)]
*  that the nicks won. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5781.679999999999s)]
*  So let's get into it. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5782.86s)]
*  He's snappin'. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5783.7s)]
*  He's going off too. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5784.54s)]
*  It is, that's not like something you would've said [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5785.36s)]
*  to Lauren Schroeder, man. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5787.099999999999s)]
*  He put more bubs than weaves. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5787.94s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5789.799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, okay, that was a bum. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5791.12s)]
*  I like that. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5793.12s)]
*  Yes, no, that's Kai. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5795.74s)]
*  And I see a lot of people online saying like, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5797.78s)]
*  nobody cares about this G League rap, da da da da da da. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5799.82s)]
*  And I just, I really hate that narrative. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5803.0599999999995s)]
*  I think it's unfair and it's not helping. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5805.179999999999s)]
*  Like this is healthy. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5807.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5808.179999999999s)]
*  Nah, it's dope, they spit. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5809.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean it's healthy if you like hip hop. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5809.839999999999s)]
*  It's healthy if you like rap. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5811.5s)]
*  I just happen to be a person who has been bumping [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5812.4400000000005s)]
*  the good to bad and the dollar menu. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5815.68s)]
*  So I'm already on Ray Vaughn. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5817.12s)]
*  And I'm a person that's always bumped Joey Badass. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5818.66s)]
*  So you know, those two, I'm all in for. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5821.16s)]
*  Why is it just those two? [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5823.8s)]

*  was Ray Vaughn and Joey Badass. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5837.88s)]
*  I've been listening to them when they dropped. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5839.28s)]

*  You're fighting for your life like me. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5869.1s)]
*  That ain't regular to him. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5870.18s)]
*  And he said, don't do that. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5871.68s)]
*  In hip hop, being called gay in a rap battle, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5872.52s)]
*  being called a snitch, being called a sucker, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5874.4400000000005s)]

*  Oh, okay. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5878.68s)]
*  As it pertains to rap beef. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5879.52s)]
*  Hip hop is so basic. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5880.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5882.320000000001s)]

*  like he's saying that he doesn't like the beef [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5886.76s)]
*  and that it's unfair that people only care about rap [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5888.96s)]
*  when people are beefing? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5892.240000000001s)]
*  I think, I don't believe that. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5893.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think people only care about rap [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5894.84s)]

*  And I think that if D1 knew some of the inner workings [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5897.200000000001s)]
*  of what's going on behind the scenes, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5902.139999999999s)]

*  Oh, so you think this is just the album rollout? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5904.62s)]
*  I'm not gonna say it's just the album rollout, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5906.66s)]
*  but I think that there's a lot of conversations [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5907.82s)]
*  happening behind the scenes more than people know. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5909.18s)]

*  Like, and I think people are taking it in that way. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5915.18s)]
*  You think people are taking it that way? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5917.3s)]
*  What you mean, the artists are? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5919.22s)]
*  I think the artists are taking it that way, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5920.4s)]
*  but not the audience. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5921.7s)]
*  Well, they think it's like real problems. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bwc7c0RSfQ&t=5923.3s)]
