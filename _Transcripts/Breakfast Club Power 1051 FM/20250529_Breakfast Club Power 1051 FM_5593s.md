*  So Elon Musk says he's leaving Doge [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=278.26s)]
*  He posted on X that his time as a special government employee comes to an end and he'd like to bring [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=280.98s)]
*  President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending now Musk helped the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=287.58s)]
*  Leave the Department of Government Efficiency since it was established in January and he concluded his post saying the Doge's mission will only [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=292.54s)]
*  Strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government now as a special government employee [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  Musk was allowed to work for the administration for 130 days in a calendar year [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=305.3s)]
*  And of course, like he mentioned that time is now in a stark contrast as I mentioned yesterday must said he's disappointed in President Trump [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=309.98s)]
*  So called a big beautiful bill in a preview of an interview that's set to air this weekend on CBS Sunday morning now [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=317.29999999999995s)]
*  He criticized the bill saying it undermines the work that the Doge team is doing and he also says he's not sure if a bill [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=323.26s)]
*  Can be big and beautiful at the same time. He's right [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=330.28s)]
*  Yeah, so this comes as Tesla investors are demanding Musk work 40 hours a week at the company after steep declines [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=334.96s)]
*  In sales a group of pension fund leaders claim Tesla's stock price [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=342.29999999999995s)]

*  Disconcerting [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=352.26000000000005s)]
*  Reports are cause for serious concern now the issues with the company is facing as a direct [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=354.22s)]
*  They believe that it's a direct result of must roll it at Doge now. No way [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  I wonder if Tesla can bounce back or has Elon done irreparable damage to the Tesla brand. I wonder [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=363.54s)]
*  The next thing I was gonna say [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=370.97999999999996s)]
*  We'll see if Tesla can recover now that Musk is no longer a special government employee and whether or not he'll take on [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=372.5s)]
*  That 40-hour work week. Go ahead. Yeah, I was gonna say I don't I don't think it is repairable right now [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=377.58s)]
*  I think it's gonna be where it is and I don't think people want to drive Tesla like I have a Tesla and I have [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=381.9s)]
*  To think about where I'm driving to because I know if I drive to certain places [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=386.26s)]
*  I know somebody might put some dog ish on my car or or spit on my car because people just don't like anything [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=389.09999999999997s)]
*  Elon Musk right now because all you want did was come in fire a bunch of people who shouldn't have been fired [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=395.34s)]
*  He's the reason not enough air traffic controllers at the airport [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=399.82s)]
*  You know right now and you know, you can't just f things up and then leave [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=402.52s)]
*  So if I got to think about where I want to drive my car, you know [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=406.26s)]
*  What's gonna make me do get rid of that car now drive it right speaking of effing things up and leaving [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=408.98s)]
*  No, President Trump says he will can he will oh actually let's get into the pardoning. He's on a pardoning run [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=413.7s)]
*  He pardoned rapper NBA young boy following fraud charges and signed pardons for a variety of people on Tuesday [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=419.74s)]
*  Including New York representative Michael Grimm reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley and a White House official also announced that the POTUS [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=425.02s)]
*  Signed off on a commutation of Larry Hoover sentence of six life terms now Hoover was a Chicago [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=432.26s)]
*  Street gang leader and the co-founder of gangster disciples [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=437.62s)]
*  It's unclear on how soon he will be released from federal custody [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=440.24s)]
*  But he still faces the remainder of his 200 year sentence in Illinois for the 1973 murder and I'm gonna tell you something man [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  I always knew people didn't read but yesterday just proved to me how much people didn't read the amount of people that I thought was [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=450.98s)]
*  Smart and intelligent who got online and said welcome home. Welcome home Larry Hoover. You deserve to be released blah blah blah [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=457.76s)]
*  Y'all just did not read the fine print now because yes, he got a commutation [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=463.9s)]
*  You know the difference between a commutation and a pardon right Morgan? What is it? Yeah. Okay, so the commutation basically means that his sentence is [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=467.58s)]
*  Reduced or revoked or but the pardon means that it's it's completely erased that basically that nothing ever existed essentially [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=476.18s)]
*  but the commutation it means it's still on the record, but they've they've essentially like reduced it or [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=484.74s)]

*  Hello [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=842.7s)]
*  No heavy judge [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=866.5s)]
*  Cassandra we have no idea what you're talking about Cassandra Cassandra. We have no idea [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=874.98s)]
*  You know we [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=879.44s)]
*  Name got you absolutely [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=894.6s)]
*  Now, Cassandra, I will say two things can be true. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=896.6s)]
*  One, she's the one that's accused of assaulting the federal marks. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=901.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=904.6s)]
*  Now, this could be the counsel president for North. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=905.6s)]
*  And she could put residents out and have us deported out by the police just for verbally [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=908.6s)]
*  expressing our opinions, just for talking out loud. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=914.6s)]
*  So consequences need to be had for her. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=917.6s)]
*  It needs to be made to be revived, or to jail, or get probation. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=919.6s)]
*  Now, Cassandra, I will say two things can be true, but you know, I'm not aware of what [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=923.6s)]
*  you're saying in regards to what LaMonica has done to the residents in Newark. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=928.6s)]
*  But LaMonica should not be getting charged with assault against one of those ICE agents [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=932.6s)]
*  right now, currently. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=937.6s)]
*  That's like, we all saw the video. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=938.6s)]
*  There was no assault there. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=939.6s)]
*  We all saw the video. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=940.6s)]
*  We saw how she's rocking her arms around Ms. Watson, rocking her arms around Ms. Baraka. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=941.6s)]
*  Why did she not let Mr. Baraka, who understands that he is not to try to fight with the police, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=947.6s)]
*  he was going to be extorted, he has his details there, nobody was going to bother him. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=953.6s)]
*  He's a mayor. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=957.6s)]
*  They were going to take care of him. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=958.6s)]
*  Why did she behave like that? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=960.6s)]
*  She don't even let you behave like that when she was the counsel president in her chambers. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=962.6s)]
*  She would not allow that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=966.6s)]
*  She had a lady right now, Colleen Fields, is banned from coming to the council meeting [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=968.6s)]
*  for the whole year because she made a comment that Congress, LaMonica McIver, when she was the president, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=972.6s)]
*  counsel president, didn't like. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=978.6s)]
*  She's banned for a whole year. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=980.6s)]
*  But there was consequences for us just talking out loud. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=981.6s)]
*  I understand. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=984.6s)]
*  I get it. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=986.6s)]
*  I get what you're saying. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=987.6s)]
*  So you want her to be moved to Camden because you think that the Newark system is going to look out for her or something? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=988.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=997.6s)]
*  Yes, because Paul Fishman was a U.S. attorney under the Obama administration. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=998.6s)]
*  Paul was there for like eight years. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1002.6s)]
*  He was their boss in that building. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1004.6s)]
*  Well, if LaMonica ever comes up here, we're going to save this call and play it back for her [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1006.6s)]
*  because I would like to hear her opinion on what you just said. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1010.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't know anything about it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1013.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1014.6s)]

*  So Sasha Jenkins, I'm reading a post from essence when I saw this last week. I thought that this one was the most [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1131.28s)]
*  most [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1137.04s)]
*  endearing of his legacy [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1138.12s)]
*  You want to talk a bit about Sasha Jenkins while this is loading I really don't know much about the brother [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1142.48s)]
*  I know that we he was up here one time. I think he was gonna do the [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1146.84s)]
*  Breakfast Club doc at one time. He's done documentaries. He's done muting documentaries. He's a journalist [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1150.7199999999998s)]
*  He's written for so many magazines and publications. He was just a good brother a good brother in hip-hop [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1155.44s)]
*  And just wanted to send a rest in peace [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1159.68s)]
*  Yes, absolutely [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1163.2s)]
*  Yes [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1164.16s)]
*  the essence I did a whole piece on him that I'm so mad is not coming up right now because they took a time they [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1164.5600000000002s)]
*  Took time to dive into his pen and why his pin was so important and for me today as a journalist [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1168.8400000000001s)]
*  I think that a lot of people don't understand when people talk about the pin of a journalist especially in hip-hop [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1173.8000000000002s)]
*  Why that even matters and to be when when when something happens or even before something happens to have people speak about you in [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1177.44s)]
*  A way where it's like your storytelling change lives. That's right. That is really hard to be impactful in that space [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1184.0s)]
*  So I thought essence shout out to them did a really good job of like capturing his life [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1189.16s)]
*  Everything that he had done how his influence came in. So yeah, just want to say some amazing documentaries with [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1193.36s)]
*  Mass appeal as well [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1199.72s)]
*  I really liked from him. I don't even know if this was mass appeal but he did the Wu-Tang Clan of Mike's and men documentary [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1201.72s)]
*  Yeah came out in 2019 [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1206.28s)]
*  But a lot of times we talk about the artists or we talk about the people that we see but sometimes it's the people that [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1207.72s)]
*  Behind the scenes that's really the architect and all that so recipes to that brother [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1213.16s)]
*  Yeah, and that's what I mean because it's tough as a journalist who's actually a writer and you're not like the like people think you [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1217.0800000000002s)]
*  Gotta be on camera. You gotta be loud [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1222.7600000000002s)]
*  You got to be seen to make impact the way he did through what he did coming from the time period that he came from [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1223.98s)]
*  And still have people want to take the time to talk about how amazing he was. Yeah, so make sure y'all go check that out [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1229.66s)]
*  I'm sorry that it's not coming out right now, but essence at an amazing breakdown of his career his legacy [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1236.2s)]
*  But as we move on into other news Stefan digs [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1240.64s)]
*  So we had talked a bit about you know in the tease about Stefan digs being in some trouble right now the three girls [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1244.08s)]
*  Yes, yes girl was like 20 girls on that boat, but I've seen the three. Yes in the video [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1249.64s)]
*  yes, so there are video circulating from over Memorial Day weekend of [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1254.8s)]
*  Stefan digs and Cardi B on a boat in Miami having a good time now that the issue that honestly in my opinion the internet [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1259.24s)]
*  Created was that at one point you see Stefan digs with these three with three women [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1266.68s)]
*  Cardi B is not in the video and he opens up what looks like an outtoy case and [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1270.76s)]
*  He hands whatever is in the outtoy case [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1275.64s)]
*  He hands it to these women and then you know, they go off and do whatever they do [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1278.28s)]
*  So this sparked and I think it's the time period right now and of like, you know [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1283.04s)]
*  You have so many different things going on [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1286.48s)]
*  You have this the diddy conversation and the pink cocaine conversation and we don't know what was in that case [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1288.6s)]
*  We don't even know if there's an investigation into it honestly, we do know that his team has seen it and they've had conversations [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1294.44s)]
*  It's probably won't help [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1300.76s)]
*  Nothing is at this point ESPN everybody is covering this in a way that is like, okay [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1302.76s)]
*  Here's what people are singing and here's the people are thinking but [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1307.0s)]
*  His head coach Mike variable actually had to comment on it prior to one of their [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1311.6s)]
*  Their workouts. Let's take a listen [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1318.32s)]
*  video [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1320.8799999999999s)]
*  Stefan Diggs has gotten a lot of traction in the last 24 hours or so [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1322.44s)]
*  He's on a boat having a good time [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1327.2s)]
*  But the question comes in as to a certain substance that people are guessing what is and isn't is this something that the team? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1329.52s)]
*  Has to look into well, that's something that we're aware of and obviously we want to make great decisions on and off the field [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1337.3600000000001s)]
*  And we're hoping that with our time here on the field today and that when we don't have a script and we're on the call [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1343.88s)]
*  Parents that were making great decisions [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1349.8s)]
*  and so the message will be the same for our players that were we're trying to make great decisions and [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1351.8s)]
*  Any conversations that I've had with Stefan will remain between him and I in the club [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1357.32s)]
*  How do you even figure out what the substance was and that's my point they went to the worst [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1361.72s)]
*  I said, oh yeah, this is maybe that breath was hot and he was giving them out to us [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1365.76s)]
*  Yeah, people instantly jobs real they was trying to ease up, you know real close though. They didn't ease they was close [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1369.2s)]
*  They was all in it. I thought at first that was well, so that's all the video [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1375.0s)]
*  I didn't even peep the whole little case thing [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1378.36s)]
*  I just saw the girls and I but I knew Cardi was on the boat and I'm like people gonna have an issue with the [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1380.6s)]
*  Fact that these girls are so close and he's with Cardi now [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1384.9799999999998s)]
*  And it was the one that eased in between his legs a little bit. He moved [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1387.1999999999998s)]

*  Sean Duffy says allocation for the FAA in the house approved spending package will not be enough [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1636.5s)]
*  He said it won't be enough to support needed upgrades to air traffic operations [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1643.36s)]
*  Now Duffy has repeatedly said low staffing numbers and outdated technology are the root of various incidents that require significant funding [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1647.82s)]
*  Now speaking to reporters Duffy said we're going to need to fully fund the project and added that we need it all up front [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1655.22s)]
*  And that's a big ask for Congress to give the money all up front from for that [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1661.62s)]
*  Which is necessary, but we're going to he's basically saying they're gonna need all the money up front in order for this [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1666.8999999999999s)]
*  Project the overhaul of the ATC systems to be successful now Duffy's overhaul is expected to include brand new telecom radar and radio [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1673.2199999999998s)]
*  Equipment as well as updates to front and back ends of the air traffic control system now with this Duffy also provided an update on [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1680.86s)]
*  Problems at Newark Liberty International Airport. Let's take a listen to those comments [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1688.8999999999999s)]
*  This is a safe system and there's redundancies. But again, I'm concerned that [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1693.26s)]
*  We could have more of Newark's this truly is a moment to look at what kind of system we're using [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1698.14s)]
*  What kind of equipment we use what kind of telecom we use and it's a call to action to make sure we build a brand new [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1706.7s)]
*  Air traffic control system. Here's what I don't understand. We know this bill, you know provides a lot of tax cuts for the rich [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1713.14s)]
*  Don't you rich fly? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1719.74s)]
*  Like don't people in Congress fly like what would be the hold up? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1721.1000000000001s)]
*  What would be keeping you from making sure air traffic control gets the money it needs for upgrades? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1724.58s)]
*  You don't need to penny pinch when it comes to that [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1730.1399999999999s)]
*  but even if you fly private you are still impacted by the lack of FAA traffic controllers and [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1732.46s)]
*  Like I said people in Congress fly [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1737.78s)]
*  So what would be the hold up like what why wouldn't you just make sure they got all the money they need to get the upgrades for? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1739.74s)]
*  Air traffic operation. Yeah, that is a that is an amazing question and you're right [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1746.1s)]
*  Even if you do fly private you still are subject to you know certain rules and regulations in terms of air traffic controllers [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1750.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're definitely necessary and need to be used in that regard. So you're right. Sheesh [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1757.26s)]
*  I don't know but to but Duffy does say that [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1763.06s)]
*  FAA's Traycon facility in Philadelphia is the one that oversees the North airspace [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1767.42s)]
*  It will get 16 more air traffic controllers by the fall [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1771.5s)]
*  That number is currently working out of Traycon after five [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1774.54s)]
*  Controllers took mental health leave last month saying they were traumatized by the recent events of that going dark [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1778.98s)]
*  The 90 seconds of the communication systems going dark. I mean, I guess a lot of pressure [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1784.1s)]
*  They said they don't want to be responsible for you know [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1789.18s)]
*  Getting killed and something that McDuffie said just now that's very important. He's Duffy said that's very important [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1792.78s)]
*  He said he don't want more new works. So you may not be paying attention to it now because it's just newer [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1798.22s)]
*  What about when it's the airport in your area? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1802.86s)]
*  Well, I spoke about that yesterday saying that there are three airports in Texas alone [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1804.98s)]
*  I believe Austin Houston and [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1809.9s)]
*  I'm thinking San Antonio that are also dealing with shortages in air traffic control system [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1812.3s)]
*  So, you know, it's one of the situations is sad [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1817.2s)]
*  But hopefully, you know, you're proactive on this situation as opposed to reactive and you know reactive means that something has happened. So [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1819.38s)]
*  Yeah to your point Charlemagne [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1826.66s)]
*  It is a matter of like getting it done and figuring out Congress holds the purse and is this something that is [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1828.62s)]
*  important enough for Congress to go ahead and [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1835.02s)]
*  Make a move but Duffy is asking Congress for billions of dollars to gut aging airport infrastructure [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1837.86s)]
*  Around the country and rebuild from scratch and Congress flies. That's that's what's so mind-boggling to me [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1843.34s)]
*  It's just like why are we just sitting around waiting for something? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1849.34s)]
*  That into DCA where they've already been situation so [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1852.82s)]
*  Yeah, Congress go ahead [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1857.58s)]

*  I mean we are entering in the late 20s and 30s and that's when the Harlem Renaissance happened [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=1993.34s)]

*  Just a lot about our history and just American history in general world history in general [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=2020.5400000000002s)]

*  The latest with Lauren LaRosa [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3589.88s)]
*  Sometimes you have facts sometimes you have details [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3591.88s)]
*  Sometimes you have a little bit of everything [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3593.88s)]
*  But we're still latest [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3595.88s)]
*  Talk to me [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3597.88s)]
*  So yesterday Diddy was denied a mistrial [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3599.88s)]
*  His team [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3601.88s)]
*  His defense attorneys [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3603.88s)]
*  Asked for a mistrial because [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3605.88s)]
*  They said that after it was revealed in court yesterday [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3607.88s)]
*  After they were speaking to an arson investigator [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3609.88s)]
*  That [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3611.88s)]
*  The fingerprints [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3613.88s)]
*  Remember we had the conversation about there was fingerprints found on this bottle [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3615.88s)]
*  In the car when the cocktail was thrown and all those things right allegedly [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3617.88s)]
*  Well they're trying to talk about the fingerprints that would have been [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3619.88s)]
*  If they were properly held all of this time [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3621.88s)]
*  From the alleged burglary that happened in Kid Cudi's home [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3623.88s)]
*  So Kid Cudi says that [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3625.88s)]
*  Or alleges that Diddy went in his home [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3627.88s)]
*  He you know went through some of his Chanel Christmas gifts for family [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3629.88s)]
*  He alleges that Diddy put his dog away in another room [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3631.88s)]
*  And then he pulled up [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3633.88s)]
*  Now what is happening is [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3635.88s)]
*  He's been in the house for a while [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3637.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3639.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3641.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3643.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3645.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3647.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3649.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3651.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3653.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3655.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3657.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3659.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3661.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3663.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3665.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3667.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3669.88s)]
*  And he's been in the house for a while [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3671.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, the prosecutors, the government was saying [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3673.88s)]
*  Look, we shouldn't even be able to talk about this [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3675.88s)]
*  Because that bottle could have went through so many hands [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3677.88s)]
*  We don't have a good expert to break down what this means [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3679.88s)]
*  The person that we're talking to wasn't even a person [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3684.88s)]
*  Who did the actual report on the fingerprints [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3686.88s)]
*  Basically, it could mislead a jury [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3688.88s)]
*  Diddy's team is like, no, the DNA evidence that was found [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3690.88s)]
*  Is what was found, and it allegedly pointed back to a woman [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3693.88s)]
*  You can't even match that to anything in the home [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3696.88s)]
*  Because there's no fingerprints whatsoever [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3700.88s)]
*  So Diddy's team is saying, or they were trying to say [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3703.88s)]
*  Hey, look, the government knows that the fact that we don't have these fingerprints [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3705.88s)]
*  The fact that you can't match it to when you guys are trying to say that [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3710.88s)]
*  Our client Diddy did all of this [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3713.88s)]
*  Both the burglary and the car [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3715.88s)]
*  Because he's upset at Kid Cudi for dating Cassie allegedly [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3717.88s)]
*  You can't connect the two, and knowing that, that's not fair to him [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3720.88s)]
*  Because that actually could prove that he doesn't have anything to do with one or the other [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3723.88s)]
*  And y'all are not trying to have a conversation about that, so it's unfair [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3727.88s)]
*  So this is a mistrial [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3730.88s)]
*  The judge denied it [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3731.88s)]
*  Of course [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3732.88s)]
*  The judge denied it, but it's not happening [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3733.88s)]
*  Maybe they're just trying to throw anything against the wall to see what sticks [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3735.88s)]
*  To see if they can possibly get a mistrial [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3738.88s)]
*  They'll try again, I'm sure, but no [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3740.88s)]
*  It's reeking of desperation at this point [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3742.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, you're fighting for your life after that Capricorn Clark testimony [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3745.88s)]
*  You're definitely fighting for your life after that [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3750.88s)]
*  But in other news, in relation, Cassie had her baby yesterday [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3752.88s)]
*  Hey! [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3755.88s)]
*  That's what's up [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3756.88s)]
*  Congratulations [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3757.88s)]
*  Salute to her [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3758.88s)]
*  You've been nailing that note all day [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3759.88s)]
*  Yes, I love you, sir [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3760.88s)]
*  Yes, Cassie welcomed her third baby yesterday [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3761.88s)]
*  Less than two weeks after testifying in this trial against Diddy [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3764.88s)]
*  She gave birth in a New York hospital like we talked about [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3768.88s)]
*  And the reports are that she is healthy and she is doing well [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3771.88s)]
*  Yes, that is what matters [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3775.88s)]
*  That's what's up [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3777.88s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3778.88s)]
*  Congratulations [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3779.88s)]
*  Glad to hear all of that [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3780.88s)]
*  Alex Fon, my best [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3781.88s)]
*  Alex Fon, yes [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3782.88s)]
*  Her and her men [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3783.88s)]
*  Her men, this is her third baby with her husband, Alex Fon, yes [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3784.88s)]
*  Mentally and emotionally, that has to be a lot [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3787.88s)]
*  That has to be like the extreme [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3789.88s)]
*  I wonder, did she have an extreme down taking that stand? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3792.88s)]
*  I'm sure she had to relive a lot of trauma, right? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3796.88s)]
*  Watching her [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3798.88s)]
*  Then a couple weeks later, now you're having a baby [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3799.88s)]
*  So I just know she's been on an emotional rollercoaster the last few weeks [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3801.88s)]
*  I bet she was on a stand contracting, right? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3805.88s)]
*  Was she holding her stomach or something like that? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3807.88s)]
*  I don't know what contractions look like [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3809.88s)]
*  But if I had to guess, I mean she was definitely [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3811.88s)]
*  She's holding her stomach [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3813.88s)]
*  There was a couple times where she even herself asked for breaks [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3815.88s)]
*  And of course, a great gave her the breaks [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3818.88s)]
*  She was pretty close to her [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3820.88s)]
*  But it's also just a lot of mental pressure as well too [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3822.88s)]
*  And they made a re-watch the video in the Intercontinental Hotel [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3825.88s)]
*  Where she was dragged up and down [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3828.88s)]
*  And it was tough watching her do that because she was so pregnant [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3830.88s)]
*  So I can't imagine how she felt in it [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3833.88s)]
*  And then how her husband felt as well too [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3835.88s)]
*  So I mean maybe, I don't know [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3837.88s)]
*  I had been told that her original due date was the first week of June from a source [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3839.88s)]
*  But I don't know if that had anything to do with it [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3844.88s)]
*  But the baby is here, she is healthy, Cassie is she, the baby is healthy [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3846.88s)]
*  And Alex Fine is doing well too [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3851.88s)]
*  That's the most important thing [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3853.88s)]
*  So she had the baby today or yesterday? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3854.88s)]
*  So I've been told, it was announced yesterday [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3856.88s)]
*  But I've been told that she actually had the baby the day before [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3859.88s)]
*  Later in the evening from the source [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3861.88s)]
*  And I was so mad, nevermind [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3863.88s)]
*  Okay, it's alright [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3865.88s)]
*  So mad what? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3866.88s)]
*  Nothing [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3867.88s)]
*  So you were mad for us because she had the information? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3868.88s)]
*  Yes, but I was trying to make sure I double, triple confirmed [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3869.88s)]
*  And by the time I was doing all that, boom, here go ABC News [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3872.88s)]
*  Well it's better to be right [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3876.88s)]
*  The problem with this area is everybody wants to be first [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3878.88s)]
*  And they don't be having the right information [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3881.88s)]
*  And I also was trying not to be invasive [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3883.88s)]
*  I texted Arlamian and was like, should I even dig on this? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3885.88s)]
*  Because if it is the pressure of the case, I don't want to be the person that puts it out there [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3888.88s)]
*  And she don't want it out there [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3891.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3892.88s)]
*  But yes, shout out to ABC News, they were the first people I saw with it up [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3893.88s)]
*  But let me tell y'all, I was on y'all, okay? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3896.88s)]
*  And while we had a happy birthday to a couple real niggas, man [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3898.88s)]

*  Yep, time for donkey today [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3915.88s)]
*  Arlamian, who you giving that donkey to? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3916.88s)]
*  Man, four after the hour, we need to talk fat shaming [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3917.88s)]
*  We need to talk body shaming [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3918.88s)]
*  You? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3919.88s)]
*  Okay, hush, shh [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3920.88s)]
*  There's a woman named Christy Lee Crampton [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3921.88s)]
*  She needs to come to the front of the congregation [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3923.88s)]
*  We would like to have a word with her, okay? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3925.88s)]
*  Alright [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3927.88s)]
*  There are politically correct terms for obesity [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3928.88s)]
*  And we will, this is a teachable moment [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3931.88s)]
*  I don't think you should be the teacher with this one [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3933.88s)]
*  But alright [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3936.88s)]
*  And then after that, Jess fixed my mess [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3937.88s)]

*  You're having relationship issues and problems [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3941.88s)]
*  Call Jess right now, it's the Breakfast Club, good morning [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3943.88s)]

*  Well, you need to tell them [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3957.88s)]

*  You have the voice, tell them [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3959.88s)]

*  It's time for donkey of the day [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3962.88s)]
*  It's a read, but you're so good at it [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3964.88s)]
*  You trying to be a fake ass Charlamagne [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3966.88s)]
*  You're the only one Charlamagne to guard [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3968.88s)]
*  Oh [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3970.88s)]
*  Damn Charlamagne, who you give a dusty of the day to, man? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3971.88s)]
*  Well, donkey of the day for Thursday, May 29th [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3974.88s)]
*  Goes to Christy Lee Crampton [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3977.88s)]
*  Christy is an example of why [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3978.88s)]
*  When you go to Florida, you should only drink bottled water [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3980.88s)]
*  Okay, don't drink the water out the tap [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3983.88s)]
*  Don't put the water out the tap in your tea, your coffee [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3985.88s)]
*  Nothing [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3988.88s)]
*  Because soon as you take a sip of that water [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3989.88s)]
*  You become a Florida fool [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3991.88s)]
*  Christy not from Florida [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3993.88s)]
*  But this situation happened while she was heading back home [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3995.88s)]
*  From her family's Disney World vacation [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=3998.88s)]
*  She must have drank out the drinking fountains at Disney [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4000.88s)]
*  Because she was full of Florida foolishness [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4003.88s)]
*  Now I can't even talk about this story the way I want to [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4006.88s)]
*  Until I tell you what happened [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4009.88s)]
*  We had Kisha Cole here last hour [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4011.88s)]
*  And she was talking about one of her children [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4013.88s)]
*  And she was talking about her child calling her other child a big back [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4015.88s)]
*  But her child isn't fat, he's just bralic [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4019.88s)]
*  And I was explaining to her that big back should be reserved for the obese amongst us [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4022.88s)]
*  Okay, God forgive me for being a notorious fat shamer [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4026.88s)]
*  I don't mean to be, okay? It's something I'm working on [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4030.88s)]
*  You have to understand that growing up [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4032.88s)]
*  Your mama sold fat jokes with some of the first jokes we learned [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4034.88s)]
*  And clearly that cycle is continued, okay? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4037.88s)]
*  Fat shaming isn't a race thing, it is an agenda thing [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4039.88s)]
*  Humans fat shame other humans [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4042.88s)]
*  And there are some fat folks amongst us, okay? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4044.88s)]
*  Let's go to WFTV9 for the report please [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4047.88s)]
*  Christy Lee Crampton was set to be back home from her family's Disney World vacation [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4050.88s)]
*  Instead she made her first appearance in front of a Seminole County judge Tuesday [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4054.88s)]
*  Charged with felony child abuse [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4058.88s)]
*  Allegiant flight 2885 to Hagerstown, Maryland was set to take off from Orlando-Sanford International Airport [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4060.88s)]
*  Just before 2pm Monday [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4066.88s)]
*  But according to this arrest report, Crampton and witnesses on the plane tell police [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4068.88s)]
*  The child called Crampton fat and Miss Piggy [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4072.88s)]
*  Telling her she couldn't fit in the airplane seat [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4075.88s)]
*  That's when witnesses say Crampton began hitting the child with her fist [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4078.88s)]
*  And then hit him on the head with a water bottle [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4082.88s)]
*  Then the report says she slammed the child's head into the airplane window [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4085.88s)]
*  The child used his arms to cover his head [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4089.88s)]
*  Airport police haven't said how old the child is [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4092.88s)]
*  But Crampton told police the child was very rude and disrespectful during their trip to Disney [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4095.88s)]
*  And then after the child called her fat, she took his phone away [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4100.88s)]
*  She claims he then pushed her arm off the armrest twice [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4104.88s)]
*  And that's when she began smacking him [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4107.88s)]
*  But police and witnesses say she went beyond typical disciplinary actions [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4109.88s)]
*  I have so many questions, so many thoughts, so many observations [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4117.88s)]
*  Okay, first off, Miss Piggy is a mortal [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4120.88s)]
*  Okay, a child still calling a high calorie human Miss Piggy in 2025 [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4123.88s)]
*  Drop on the clues, Bumps, for Miss Piggy [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4127.88s)]
*  Icon! Okay, the irony of it all is Miss Piggy is in fact, she's actually fabulous [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4129.88s)]
*  He or she who ate all the pie should take it as a compliment if you get called Miss Piggy [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4134.88s)]
*  Now my second thought is where was this child's parents? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4139.88s)]
*  You just gonna let this salad dodger put hands on a child? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4142.88s)]
*  Okay, was the child flying alone? If so, were the flight attendants too busy to get this pantry pirate off course? [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4145.88s)]
*  Okay, let me tell you something now [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4152.88s)]
*  If I was ever in this situation and my child said something about a person being fat [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4154.88s)]
*  I'm going to apologize to said individual [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4158.88s)]
*  But you're not putting your hands on my child too much, Shakur [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4161.88s)]
*  I don't care if you're a woman or not [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4164.88s)]

*  Did you hear what she said to this child? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4171.88s)]
*  Witnesses said Crampton began hitting the child with her fist and hit him on the head with a water bottle [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4173.88s)]
*  Then she slammed the child's head into the airplane window [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4179.88s)]
*  And I bet it was a bunch of poop butt ass adults recording instead of intervening [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4182.88s)]
*  Let me tell you something, Cardi Beef [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4186.88s)]
*  It would have been some furniture moving on that plane [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4188.88s)]

*  That's why you gotta teach your kids how to be creative [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4195.88s)]
*  There is so many other things you can call a fat person other than a fat or Miss Piggy [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4199.88s)]

*  I've said Cardi Beef [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4209.88s)]

*  Or Doja Fat [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4222.88s)]

*  Doja Fat hits [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4226.88s)]
*  But the reality is none of this is right [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4228.88s)]
*  None of this is right [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4230.88s)]
*  Body shaming isn't right [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4231.88s)]
*  But that don't give you the right to put your fat fist on a child [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4233.88s)]
*  Okay, seriously [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4237.88s)]
*  How did the adults just sit back and allow this to happen? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4238.88s)]

*  Good, brother. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4510.599999999999s)]
*  Good. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4511.5599999999995s)]
*  Hey, I just want to ask Jess two real questions. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4511.96s)]
*  First off, my wife just gave birth to us, firstborn January. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4515.24s)]
*  Congratulations. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4520.759999999999s)]
*  And since the... [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4521.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4523.08s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4523.719999999999s)]
*  You're welcome. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4524.599999999999s)]
*  His name's Tyler. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4525.4s)]
*  He came about three weeks early. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4526.679999999999s)]
*  He's incredible. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4528.759999999999s)]
*  Worst thing about him is he looks exactly like mom. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4530.36s)]
*  I just wish my genes paid a little bit more in clay, but it is what it is. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4533.0s)]
*  Jess can relate. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4537.32s)]
*  I was definitely about to say it. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4539.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I can relate, because my daughter looks nothing like me. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4541.799999999999s)]
*  She's nine months going on, 10 months. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4544.839999999999s)]
*  And people say the older she gets, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4547.24s)]
*  she will start growing into the features of her mom, but I don't see it at all. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4549.0s)]
*  So it's all right. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4553.16s)]
*  Hey, man, I just... [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4554.04s)]
*  One day, I hope to see a little bit more of me in him. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4556.52s)]
*  You probably will. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4559.08s)]
*  But I just really want to ask you two real things. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4561.56s)]
*  One is sleep training. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4564.68s)]
*  I mean, you can put that to the side, but we are getting no sleep. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4567.16s)]
*  He just sleeps on us or with us, and it's just terrible. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4571.96s)]
*  My second question... [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4577.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4578.52s)]
*  He's about to turn five months. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4580.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4582.68s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4584.040000000001s)]
*  And then my second question... [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4584.68s)]
*  Okay, I'm sorry. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4586.120000000001s)]
*  My second question will be just more helpful for our relationship. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4587.400000000001s)]
*  She's going through postpartum. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4592.84s)]
*  Neither of us are getting sleep, like I kind of mentioned earlier. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4594.84s)]
*  And then we're on a split shift, so we don't have to pay for daycare. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4597.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4602.200000000001s)]
*  So she's on first shift, I'm on second. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4603.0s)]
*  Only time we're both home is from 12 a.m., basically, until 6 a.m. in the morning. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4605.72s)]
*  And we're not doing any talking, to be honest with you. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4611.0s)]
*  So I just need help with helping him sleep and then helping us kind of find time and get back together. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4614.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4620.84s)]
*  So the first thing, helping the baby with the sleep. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4621.56s)]
*  The baby is only four months, right? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4623.88s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4626.04s)]
*  Is the baby breastfed? [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4626.68s)]
*  He's not breastfed. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4628.04s)]
*  Mom's pumping. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4629.72s)]
*  I would just twist the formula because that was a lot. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4631.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, I got you. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4634.04s)]
*  I resonate. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4635.72s)]
*  I'm there with you. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4636.4400000000005s)]
*  It could be different reasons. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4637.88s)]
*  I was going to say usually the baby is much, much more attached to the mom when they're [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4638.92s)]
*  getting that bonding with breastfeeding directly. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4644.92s)]
*  Not just pumping, but you know, just, oh, is that the little baby versus the baby? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4649.72s)]
*  Yeah, mom's at work. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4654.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's telling you, don't be telling all my business to this lady or that I don't know like that. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4656.12s)]
*  But no. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4660.68s)]
*  My bad. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4661.320000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4661.88s)]
*  But no, no, no, no, no, it's fine. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4662.360000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4664.12s)]
*  That baby only four months. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4666.12s)]
*  Y'all got a few more months to go because although my daughter has always slept that [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4667.32s)]
*  night, it really could just be the baby. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4672.68s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4675.4s)]
*  It's a little boy. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4675.72s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4676.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4677.16s)]
*  He could really just be trying to figure out night from day, his sleeping patterns, you [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4677.88s)]
*  know what I'm saying? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4681.96s)]
*  Do y'all sit around and hold them because y'all can't be holding these babies. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4682.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4687.48s)]
*  Y'all sit around and hold them. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4688.92s)]
*  I was going to say I was trying to give you a way out. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4690.5199999999995s)]
*  I thought it was because of the breastfeeding. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4692.44s)]
*  But if you sit around and hold the baby, which is not called spoiling, it's called just loving, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4693.879999999999s)]
*  then you have to eventually the same amount of time you hold them is the same amount of [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4699.48s)]
*  time he has to be put down. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4704.12s)]
*  Like, you know, he has to start putting them in his bassinet. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4705.639999999999s)]
*  Don't have them sleep with you. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4708.2s)]
*  That was the hardest part of breastfeeding my daughter and just having a newborn. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4710.5199999999995s)]
*  I want her to sleep in the bed with me. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4715.0s)]
*  That's not safe. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4716.5199999999995s)]
*  Not only is it not safe, it's not really good. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4717.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's not really good. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4719.96s)]
*  It's going to be hard to get the babies out of the bed, you know, between you and your wife. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4721.16s)]
*  And then it's nothing that you can do right now other than just be there because she is [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4726.12s)]
*  more than likely in the thick of it as it relates to postpartum. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4734.36s)]
*  So it's not really not much that you can do other than just be there. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4738.92s)]
*  Just keep affirming her, compliment her, let her know she's beautiful because trust me, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4743.08s)]
*  listen, take it from me. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4747.48s)]
*  I did not feel beautiful. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4748.84s)]
*  I'm just starting to feel beautiful again a few months ago. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4749.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4752.52s)]
*  But these kids suck everything out of you, man. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4754.4400000000005s)]
*  She just gave life, you know, a very beautiful thing. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4757.64s)]
*  So just love on your woman, you know what I mean? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4760.28s)]
*  And just stick it out. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4762.84s)]
*  It's only four months. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4764.68s)]
*  Y'all got about four more months to go until she'll probably be feeling. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4765.8s)]
*  Although it's different for other women, but just give her a break. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4770.2s)]
*  Just give her some grace. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4773.24s)]
*  And then I know you get sleep where you can. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4774.2s)]
*  All right. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4776.36s)]
*  We'll do our best. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4777.400000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4778.36s)]
*  Can I give her a shout out real quick? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4779.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=4780.76s)]

*  Talk to me. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5106.0599999999995s)]
*  All right, y'all. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5107.74s)]
*  So yesterday, Larry Hoover was commuted on a federal level by President Donald Trump. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5108.3s)]
*  Now, for people who don't understand what that means, that means that basically, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5115.26s)]
*  and we talked about this in Front Page News this morning, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5119.0199999999995s)]
*  his charges on the federal level will be like excused or overlooked. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5121.42s)]
*  But anything else you're still dealing with, you still have to deal with. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5124.78s)]
*  And Larry Hoover is very much so still dealing with a 200-year sentence [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5127.1s)]
*  for murder on the state level. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5131.42s)]
*  State level, right? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5132.78s)]
*  Yeah, state level. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5133.34s)]
*  So he's not free? [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5134.06s)]
*  No, he's not. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5134.9400000000005s)]
*  People are saying welcome home and all that. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5135.58s)]
*  He is not free. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5137.02s)]
*  He is not coming home. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5137.74s)]
*  He is not walking out. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5138.78s)]
*  Ain't no welcome home Larry Hoover parties. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5140.22s)]
*  I didn't even know what it meant. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5141.5s)]
*  That's why I text you on the root line. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5142.38s)]
*  What is commutation or what is commute? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5143.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5145.5s)]
*  I believe he was moving from one person to another. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5145.74s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5147.74s)]
*  Chance the Rapper was one of the people who actually posted online. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5149.18s)]
*  Now let's take a listen. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5151.820000000001s)]
*  Hey, before I let y'all politicize this or memeify this, I just gotta say I am glad that Larry [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5152.780000000001s)]
*  Hoover is home. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5158.780000000001s)]
*  And I gotta remind y'all that he was a political prisoner that was set up by the federal government, [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5159.9800000000005s)]
*  that he created the, what was it, Chicago votes. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5165.02s)]
*  He did so many things to really mobilize our people, and he was really targeted for that. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5169.34s)]
*  So before I get to Kona and I do whatever they're gonna do with this information, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5175.900000000001s)]
*  I just want to say I'm so glad that he's home and I'm, God bless his family. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5179.900000000001s)]
*  And yeah, thank God. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5184.700000000001s)]
*  Chance earned my feelings because he that's just spreading such misinformation and Chance [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5186.22s)]
*  is way smarter than that. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5189.740000000001s)]
*  You know, if you just read a little bit more of Chance, you would know he's not coming [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5191.26s)]
*  home, but that just lets me know all Chance did was read the headlines. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5194.9400000000005s)]
*  Or saw J Prince's post, J Prince of Laugh-A-Lot over in Houston. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5198.06s)]
*  Laugh-A-Lot, Laugh-A-Lot. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5202.78s)]
*  Sorry, Laugh-A-Lot. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5204.38s)]
*  This has to stop. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5205.179999999999s)]
*  He don't even laugh. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5206.0599999999995s)]
*  This is all about the rap-a-lot. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5206.78s)]
*  Laugh-A-Lot. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5208.94s)]
*  Now this is disgusting. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5209.74s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5210.54s)]
*  Now this is rap-a-lot. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5211.259999999999s)]
*  You gotta grow up. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5212.54s)]
*  Laugh-A-Lot. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5213.74s)]
*  Laugh-A-Lot. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5214.219999999999s)]
*  Sorry y'all. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5215.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5216.219999999999s)]
*  Oh my bad. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5216.719999999999s)]
*  Oh geez, my bad. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5217.58s)]
*  Oh geez. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5218.7s)]
*  Rap-a-lot posted yesterday and when he posted, his caption literally said, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5220.78s)]
*  Larry Hoover has been pardoned by Donald Trump. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5223.98s)]
*  So even when I posted it and people were upset, I posted it exactly with what J Prince said [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5226.139999999999s)]
*  because I knew people were going to be upset about it because it doesn't mean that he's walking out of [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5231.58s)]
*  That's not even accurate. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5235.34s)]
*  Anywhere today or tomorrow. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5236.62s)]
*  He wasn't a pardon. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5237.98s)]
*  He was commuted. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5238.7s)]
*  No, he was commuted, yeah. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5239.34s)]
*  So to explain a bit really quick who Larry Hoover was, he was the co-founder of the [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5239.9s)]
*  Gangster Disciples which was a Chicago-based gang that according to police engaged in drug, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5243.98s)]
*  trafficking, extortion, and murder which is why he's going through everything he's going through [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5250.94s)]
*  right now. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5254.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5254.78s)]
*  Now we talked to Larry Hoover's son because I was trying to get clarification for you guys [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5255.42s)]
*  on what this actually means and what the state level looks like for Larry Hoover right now. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5259.9s)]
*  I've been speaking on this anytime I was interviewed and I was trying to let people know [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5264.54s)]
*  that he was being held under dual jurisdiction which is he's been held under state law and he [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5268.7s)]
*  has been held under federal law at the same time. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5273.98s)]
*  So he still had two cases to fight. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5277.099999999999s)]
*  So he had to fight the federal case and he still had to fight the state case. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5279.42s)]
*  So now he's dealing with the state case. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5283.42s)]
*  I don't really know the law on it. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5285.74s)]
*  I heard that it was illegal to hold a person under dual jurisdiction which they don't usually do [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5287.58s)]
*  but they never uplifted the state case when they took him into federal custody. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5293.42s)]
*  So now we're dealing with state law now. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5297.1s)]
*  And then when I posted it online I knew that the natural pushback would be but this man is [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5300.54s)]
*  responsible for you know the like I mentioned there is alleged drug traffic and extortion [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5305.34s)]
*  and murder. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5310.860000000001s)]
*  So I asked his son like this is how people feel. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5311.820000000001s)]
*  They feel like you're glorifying someone who caused all of these things in the community. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5314.3s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5318.54s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5319.42s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5344.3s)]
*  And so what's your call to action? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5367.34s)]
*  I saw something on the live yesterday you guys were tagging. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5369.5s)]
*  Who's the person you guys are tagging? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5372.3s)]
*  Is it the governor mayor? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5373.82s)]
*  Oh yeah it's governor Pritzker that's his Instagram and then his Gmail is governor at illinoise.gov. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5375.5s)]
*  We want to reach out to governor Pritzker to tell him to ask him to sign the paper [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5384.46s)]
*  to give my father a second chance at life. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5390.86s)]
*  So yeah I mean Larry Hoover is not there's no welcome home Larry Hoover parties today [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5393.82s)]
*  or tomorrow it's not happening. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5397.58s)]
*  They're trying to get things handled on a state level but even if so what I think [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5398.78s)]
*  what they're trying to do is they want less. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5402.62s)]
*  They know that he there's no way that he's going to walk free 100% but they want less. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5405.26s)]
*  They feel like it's over excessive and as you heard the sensei they feel like he's a [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5409.42s)]
*  changed person now he should be looked at as that. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5412.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5414.14s)]
*  Yeah 200 years 200 years in prison is crazy but I can't see it happening only because of [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5414.46s)]
*  who the governor is. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5419.9800000000005s)]
*  The governor is with JB Pritzker he's a democrat. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5420.78s)]
*  Yeah they're trying to put some I guess pressure on them get the public to start writing letters [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5424.46s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5427.42s)]
*  JB don't give a damn. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5428.06s)]
*  They were online yesterday on Instagram live I was on there. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5429.18s)]
*  There was on there for about an hour getting people to tag them and saying call his office [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5431.5s)]
*  and I'm like I don't know if that's going to work because Larry Hoover was such a big [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5435.34s)]
*  name the case was such a big thing like I don't know if he cares and then yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5438.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5443.34s)]
*  So that's it. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5443.58s)]
*  Now that is the latest with Lauren you heading to court now. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cKfa7zsjrE&t=5444.46s)]
