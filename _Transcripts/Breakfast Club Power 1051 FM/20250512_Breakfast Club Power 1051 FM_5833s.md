*  It was all fine like at home. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=260.42s)]
*  I was able to be with my kids. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=261.42s)]
*  That's a beautiful thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=262.42s)]
*  All right, y'all, let's get into it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=263.42s)]
*  First up on the front page, in case you missed it, Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ross Baraka [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=265.22s)]
*  is out of jail after being arrested on Friday for allegedly trespassing at an ICE immigration [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=269.54s)]
*  detention center. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=274.64s)]
*  Now, DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, described the facility saying it houses MS-13 [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=275.64s)]
*  gang members and rapists. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=282.7s)]
*  While President Trump's acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, made the arrest. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=285.74s)]
*  And here's what she had to say about it in part. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=290.09999999999997s)]
*  Let's take a listen to it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=292.98s)]
*  The mayor has publicly for three days been saying that he's going to break in, eventually [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=293.98s)]
*  did break in, was given multiple opportunities to remove himself. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=299.9s)]
*  We will not stand for anybody getting in the way of getting rid of criminals in this country. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=310.53999999999996s)]
*  So Mayor Baraka, he spoke out about the incident following his release, saying he felt like [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=312.78s)]
*  he was targeted, his rights were violated, and he's weighing his legal options moving [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=316.34s)]
*  forward. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=321.3s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=322.3s)]
*  I'm the mayor of the city. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=323.3s)]
*  I have the right to go anywhere in this city, particularly in places where I think our laws [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=324.9s)]
*  are being violated. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=330.82s)]
*  I will confer with my lawyers to figure out what's the best pathway forward on this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=332.0s)]
*  I think they completely violated my rights. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=336.14s)]
*  They obviously targeted me. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=338.58s)]
*  It was more than, I wasn't the only one out there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=339.82s)]
*  They came directly to me and tried to arrest me. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=342.54s)]
*  No one else. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=347.66s)]
*  So Baraka, he's urging fellow Democrats to continue to push for access to ICE detention [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=348.66s)]
*  centers in the ICE detention center where he was arrested. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=354.86s)]
*  It's giving good trouble, necessary trouble. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=358.74s)]
*  But Democrats, Democratic representative Rob Menendez Jr., LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=360.66s)]
*  Watson Coleman were also involved in the incident at Delaney Hall. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=366.70000000000005s)]
*  Biden claims the Trump administration is acting like a, quote, dictatorship in its [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=370.22s)]
*  pursuit to arrest immigrants in the country illegally. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=374.3s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman's comments. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=377.22s)]
*  We the people will make sure that this administration adheres to the rules that separate us from [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=381.86s)]
*  dictatorships in other third world countries. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=391.1s)]
*  Democratic rep Rob Menendez Jr. added that this is unacceptable and should shake every [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=395.22s)]
*  American to their core and our collective core is what he had to say. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=400.06s)]
*  What do you guys think about that? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=404.98s)]
*  I mean, you guys are up there in the region in the general vicinity of the area. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=405.98s)]
*  How does this make you feel? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=410.46s)]
*  I don't think this is just about a regional thing. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=411.46s)]
*  Like you know, yes, well, no, not at all. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=414.26s)]
*  But this is definitely the precedent. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=416.22s)]
*  Yeah, especially when we just saw a judge get locked up two weeks ago. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=417.7s)]
*  I mean, you know, these things happen so fast that we tend to forget. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=420.54s)]
*  But we just saw a judge get locked up a couple of weeks ago. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=423.7s)]
*  So it's not just a regional thing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=426.5s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how it's going to play out, to be totally honest with you. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to be up here on this radio acting like I got, you know, these predictions. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=432.06s)]
*  I know what's going to happen. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=435.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen in this country from this point on. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=436.98s)]
*  Well, does it does it scare you? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, in a sense that, you know, because I believe in God. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=441.94s)]
*  So it don't scare me. But, you know, it's just I just don't know how everything's going to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=444.38s)]
*  play out. All right. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=447.06s)]
*  It's not trending in the right way. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=449.86s)]
*  I tell you that much. No, not at all. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=450.94s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=452.7s)]
*  But, you know, that's your front page news for 6 a.m. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=454.34000000000003s)]

*  And then at seven, we will get into what's going on with the New York City Mayor Eric Adams. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=461.94s)]

*  Because court was actually halted on Friday, and we're going to talk about why cuz remember [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=975.0600000000001s)]
*  I was here, and I was like y'all court is over already very odd [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=979.72s)]
*  But we're gonna talk about what went down and how that's gonna affect today today is the first day of opening statement [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=982.86s)]
*  So this is a big day for puff in court now. I heard there was a rumor that Cassie might take the stand today [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=987.22s)]
*  I don't already that's what they said that's what I heard on 1010 wins. That's what I heard on news this morning [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=991.9s)]
*  We'll get into it. Okay. All right. We'll get into that next guy. It's the breakfast club. Good morning the breakfast club [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=996.38s)]
*  Morning everybody is DJ envy Jess hilarious Charlamagne the guy we are the breakfast club. Let's get to the latest with Lauren [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1004.26s)]
*  I [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1013.78s)]
*  Okay, so the diddy trial will continue today May 12th [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1033.22s)]
*  But today is a really really big day because opening statements will begin for both the prosecutors and diddy's team on the defense [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1037.66s)]
*  But before that starts they have to select the jury they were supposed to have done this on Friday [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1044.14s)]
*  That was supposed to be last day of this but the diddy's team came in and said because of cold feet [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1049.3000000000002s)]
*  We shouldn't do it today. What you mean cold feet [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1054.5800000000002s)]
*  So diddy's team alleged that if they would have selected the final members of the jury on Friday [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1056.78s)]
*  Those jury members would have had all weekend to sit get nervous get a little scared [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1062.86s)]
*  Basically like they didn't they didn't want that to happen [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1067.7399999999998s)]
*  So they were like look we feel like because of how high stake this case is [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1069.82s)]
*  Because of the person that is in question talking about puff we should wait until Monday right before we start the opening statements [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1072.9799999999998s)]
*  They have a pool of 43 jurors men and women they have them narrow that down to 12 definite jurors and six alternates [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1079.1799999999998s)]
*  So the judge agreed he said you know what you're right. I agree. Let's wait until right before opening statements [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1085.2199999999998s)]
*  We'll choose a jury and then boom we'll go right with sweat them in we'll go right into [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1091.0s)]
*  We'll go right into the actual opening statements from prosecutors in the defense [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1094.72s)]
*  So they expecting this to be a speedy trial [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  The judge has been very very adamant about wanting to stick to schedule [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  He doesn't even timing like this week court is gonna go from nine to five. He's like next week. We're gonna do 93 [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1103.52s)]
*  We're not gonna be in here all day. We won't get this done [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1108.2s)]
*  I think even with the jury thing not wanting to pick over the weekend is because they don't want to mishaps [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1110.08s)]
*  They don't want to get more people back in if the six alternates fall through like they just want to get [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1114.92s)]
*  He wants to get through it is that good or bad that they seem like they're trying to get through this fast [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1119.5s)]
*  I don't think it's a bad thing the judge seems really really really fair at the way that he's like handling both sides of it [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1123.3400000000001s)]
*  Prosecutors did push back on it a bit and I think it's just because for them [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1130.66s)]
*  They don't care about that like they want with it. I want the truth. I just want to speedy trial [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1133.54s)]
*  We want the truth when we want people to be able to devolves to the facts and all that [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1138.58s)]
*  I mean, it's still eight weeks like eight weeks is still a time period for trial [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1141.8600000000001s)]
*  Time but and if there's more time needed it seems like the judges is fair on both sides [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1145.86s)]
*  but anyway, so today prosecutors and the defense will [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1150.06s)]
*  Present their opening statements now envy you had a question about Cassie testifying [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1154.18s)]
*  I think I heard on the news on my way and they said Cassie might be testifying today [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1157.86s)]
*  Well, there have been photos that were came out of her last week at the end of the week of very very pregnant in New York [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1161.22s)]
*  It is expected that she's supposed to testify this week [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1166.3799999999999s)]
*  But for her to testify today those opening statements from both sides will have to be really really short [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1169.58s)]
*  I'm told by a source close to the case that it's possible [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1173.98s)]
*  But for that to happen a day it would like they would have to literally get through their opening statements super fast and then but it [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1177.8200000000002s)]
*  All depends on you know, what with strategy the prosecutors are trying to take [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1183.38s)]
*  Typically you wouldn't lean on a witness for your opening statements, but it depends on where they're going with it [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1188.54s)]
*  Also to Cassie's really really pregnant [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1192.8600000000001s)]
*  So I think that that's gonna play a part too in both sides wanted to make sure they can get her on a stand [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1194.54s)]
*  Early on because once she's out she's out [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1199.6599999999999s)]
*  that's gonna be a very stressful environment for her to be pregnant and be honest and and the way they gonna press her and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1202.26s)]
*  You know be bringing up all type of stuff that I'm sure that you know, she may not want to be have divulged [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1207.62s)]
*  I'm gonna be a lot. Yeah, I talked about this on the podcast the latest with Lauren LaRosa [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1212.4599999999998s)]
*  that's actually interesting point because if I'm a [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1216.1799999999998s)]
*  Prosecutor and I'm pressing or even a defense diddy's team and I'm pressing Cassie [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1219.26s)]
*  The visual of a very pregnant woman sit on a stand being pressed can turn like if I'm a person I'm like [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1224.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh my god. Yes, like what are y'all doing to her? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1229.6s)]
*  What pregnancy brain is real? You know what I'm saying? Yeah, some things can be blurry clear [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1231.84s)]
*  I don't know. I don't remember what happened. You know what I'm saying? Like she pregnant. Yeah, third trimester, right? Yeah [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1237.12s)]
*  She's let me let me before I say yeah, let me look that up [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1241.8799999999999s)]
*  Remember things that happened the day before sometimes when I was pregnant. So it's like no the XR [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1246.08s)]
*  It's just gonna be stressful for her but they got it they gotta go back and forth with her, right? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1251.68s)]
*  They gotta go to the facts. But like you said, it's gonna look so [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1255.44s)]
*  Back and forth. It's gonna be a full court press [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1258.56s)]
*  Okay, but how is everything in the book? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1261.52s)]
*  I can't how did he seem gonna be looking going full court press with this woman? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1263.88s)]
*  You know, okay, you gotta be strategic [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1267.72s)]
*  You gotta do it where you get to what you need to get to but you don't look like you're like [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1269.08s)]
*  angry [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1273.16s)]
*  He's fighting for his life [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1275.16s)]
*  You don't want the jury to feel like you're attacking a pregnant they're going to do that because of the picture that they're gonna paint [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1279.3600000000001s)]
*  Up Cassie is you not innocent. That's what they're gonna try to a hundred percent [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1284.76s)]
*  A hundred percent complicit in all of this and probably an accessory in some cases. That's what that's how they're gonna try to paint her [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1288.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they've already started kind of leaning into that now as far as how far along Cassie is she announced her pregnancy in February? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1294.72s)]
*  2025 [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1300.24s)]

*  Victim three as we know as of today still does not want to testify and his ten is telling them [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1311.9s)]
*  She does not plan on coming to court. There is now a victim five [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1317.3s)]
*  I know puffs team was trying to keep victim five out of the the conversation or whatever [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1321.34s)]
*  But victim five if victim five does testify will testify wouldn't she's not gonna be able to hide her identity [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1327.8000000000002s)]
*  And this is according to some documents that TMZ recently obtained [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1334.24s)]
*  And this victim is going to testify as a witness that did he committed an act of sexual misconduct allegedly in the past [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1338.64s)]
*  That he's but he's not being charged for this act in the case [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1345.4s)]
*  Do any of the victims have penises because you know, there was a lot of talk about you know, male stuff [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1348.24s)]

*  So we gotta stop saying that Morgan. We just got to call it what it is [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1537.82s)]

*  President Trump will return to re-emphasize his continued vision for a proud [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1589.74s)]
*  prosperous and successful Middle East where the United States and Middle Eastern nations are in cooperative relationships and where [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1594.82s)]
*  Extremism is defeated in place of commerce and cultural exchanges [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1601.74s)]
*  So this comes as Hamas is set to release the last known living American hostage in Gaza as part of an effort to reach [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1605.7s)]

*  I'm like there's no way it could possibly be yes [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1659.98s)]
*  Yes, exactly, but that's essentially what it is is that he's doing things and then it's like okay [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1664.84s)]
*  Well, he's finding holes here and holes there and then he's [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1669.62s)]

*  Country so I guess that document means nothing to this administration, so who cares but think about this outside of it [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1691.28s)]
*  Just being widely illegal these guys fund terrorist organizations [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1697.38s)]

*  And I know the Secret Service is gonna do a sweep of the plane [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1704.16s)]
*  But it's probably loaded with listening devices and tracking devices they gonna have so much Intel on our country [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1706.8400000000001s)]

*  125% levy on some US goods [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=1796.76s)]

*  We're like you even talk about that side of it more because I feel like when you first came out even when you did talk [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2163.94s)]
*  About like stuff that wasn't as positive you still kept it so positive [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2168.7000000000003s)]
*  You really get into like how you feel for real what you going through you like and it was a lot more protected when Lizzo first came on the scene from what I felt like the brand was protected a little bit more but now you're taking control over a lot more [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2172.1s)]
*  I don't know. I just think people [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2186.1s)]
*  Know me a little bit more. So I think I'm able to [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2189.9s)]
*  Communicate things and not put a bow on it or have a happy ending because y'all just know me more [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2194.34s)]
*  I think when I first came out people didn't know me so the brand is very like one note because it's like oh that's that girl [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2200.02s)]
*  That's the happy girl who be twerking with the flute. Yeah, you know and and but that happens to everybody like any artists [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2206.7s)]
*  You just become like a thing. You're not a person [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2213.22s)]
*  But I think the more we get to know artists and the longer they're in the game the brand becomes more multi [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2215.9s)]
*  multifaceted and I think mine just expanded a little bit more so I feel more comfortable communicating and [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2222.06s)]
*  Also, I feel safer on stream talking about these kinds of things because I know I'm in a room with people who get me [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2226.62s)]

*  Yes, you have to be connected to people. Mm-hmm person like it was a little insanity [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2424.68s)]
*  But I think in a little period of insanity can be helpful [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2429.2799999999997s)]
*  Because you have to do really hard work and I was at a point in my life where I [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2434.04s)]
*  The internet hated me and I could not trust the people around me like friends family [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2440.2s)]
*  Co-workers and I was severely depressed and now I feel like I know who I am [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2447.8s)]
*  I know who's I am and can't nobody shake that because once I reintroduced myself back into [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2452.2799999999997s)]
*  connecting with people and friends and [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2458.84s)]
*  Trusting the internet and you know, I'm like I know who I am. I move with a different kind of confidence [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2461.24s)]
*  We still could get it with Lizzo Lauren [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2466.56s)]
*  Does it get on your nerves though that sometimes? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2468.7599999999998s)]
*  Every single thing you do people still related to like wanting to talk about you in certain ways [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2471.12s)]
*  You were at the Met Gala the outfit went off every headline though is about your weight loss and not about how good you look [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2474.94s)]
*  And I think that that's unfair and it happens a lot with you [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2480.26s)]
*  Does that get annoying to you where it's like I can't move around that like people always want to talk about me [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2482.38s)]
*  Well, I signed up for it. I knew [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2487.58s)]
*  when you know back in 2014 and [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2490.7400000000002s)]
*  Big girls weren't wearing leotards on stage and I said I'm about to put me on one of these Beyonce dance leotards [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2494.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm about to have big girls behind me wearing them too because I I knew that my body would be the focus of that [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2501.42s)]
*  Conversation and it was something that because it was unavoidable. I either I could hide and run from it and then people are gonna do it [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2509.14s)]
*  Anyway, you know, it's like the big girl wearing your arms out theory [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2515.98s)]
*  It's like we know your arms big whether you you know cover it up or not. We know your arms [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2519.98s)]
*  Enjoy the outfit and wear your arms out [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2526.34s)]
*  But we know we know what it is. So for me, it was just like I'm just gonna run [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2531.2200000000003s)]
*  Head first into it. Um, what I didn't know is that it would never go away [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2535.7400000000002s)]
*  It's never gonna go away, but I think that I have to just like accept that and I'm actually cool with it [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2543.42s)]
*  It doesn't annoy me because I look good, you know, and even when I was bigger, I looked good [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2549.7000000000003s)]
*  So it's like say what you want, but there was always someone in the comments being like, yeah [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2555.2200000000003s)]
*  But she's still beautiful and she looks soft and face card never declines [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2560.06s)]
*  What about the time because I was reporting when all the lawsuit stuff happened and you didn't say anything for a long time [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2565.94s)]
*  Like not at all, which most people come out and say stuff. I was wondering the day that it was dropped [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2572.46s)]
*  How did you feel? Um, what was your thought process around that because you were in isolation at that point, right? I was in Japan [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2576.82s)]
*  Yeah, I had it like a dream trip a breath of fresh air [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2582.46s)]
*  Did you feel like but the conversation is still there and this is hard always very hard because I was confused [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2585.7799999999997s)]
*  I was confused and I was a little like hurt but I was in Japan with it was my first time ever being in Japan [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2591.7799999999997s)]

*  We were at Hello Kitty World and I'm like crying in the car [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2602.7s)]
*  But I'm like, okay wipe your tears and go in there and have fun with the babies [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2606.9399999999996s)]
*  Because we had Hello Kitty World and you only do this once with these kids who've never been to Japan and that's their dream [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2611.42s)]
*  So I did a lot of balance in between that but I'll tell you one thing about Tokyo [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2617.26s)]
*  They don't give a fuck what's going on in your personal life in Tokyo. They're like [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2621.38s)]

*  I had my first panic attack when I came back to LA for the first time after [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2647.66s)]
*  Everything the lawsuit had dropped and I was in Japan for like a month and I landed in [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2653.8999999999996s)]

*  I had pressure on my chest. I said something's really wrong [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2674.66s)]
*  I couldn't use my limbs or my body and I was like I literally crawled to my bed and just like broke down [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2676.7s)]
*  I was like what's happening to me and I talked to my doctor and was like, yeah, you had a panic attack [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2683.32s)]

*  I'm not a victim so I don't want to say attack but it was like, you know this pressure or this like I don't know [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2698.44s)]
*  It's like implied energy in America where I'm like, oh I need to hide [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2704.08s)]
*  Versus Japan I could be a Hello Kitty world and everyone's like [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2709.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2712.8s)]
*  And that one that when you started thinking people hated you [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2723.44s)]
*  But I wonder do you remember what the industry felt like or what what social media even felt like before that lawsuit? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2725.84s)]
*  It felt very like silly and light-hearted and I had like a lot of freedom to just scroll and not see nothing about me [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2731.7200000000003s)]
*  And then I was on and I was scroll and every like three scrolls it was and I was like, oh [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2740.08s)]
*  We're be like Liz if I just see two Z's I my heart start racing [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2745.9199999999996s)]
*  Scrolling so it felt it felt a little bit more hostile, but I'll say in general [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2753.48s)]
*  I think the internet has gotten more hostile for everybody [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2758.64s)]
*  like out of nowhere like it used to be so fun and light-hearted and now everybody is beefing and quarreling and [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2761.64s)]
*  Dropping tea and and I'm just like whoa, when did this happen? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2769.48s)]
*  But that's when it happened for me like I was like, oh I have to get off and so from I would say [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2772.6800000000003s)]
*  October 2023 to maybe even like April 2024 [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2780.1600000000003s)]
*  I wasn't on my phone at all. I threw my phone away [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2785.88s)]
*  Like I had my team post things for me cuz I had to post about yitty and I had to post about you know [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2788.8s)]
*  Little things I wanted to share with people [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2795.2400000000002s)]
*  I didn't want to completely disappear because that's not who I am [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2796.96s)]
*  But my team posted it for me and I did not scroll I did not look at the internet [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2800.04s)]
*  Because I was too sensitive and I think I don't think I could have handled it [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2804.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'll also say this in reference to the the lawsuit [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2808.88s)]
*  I would say in light of all of the other like high-profile lawsuits that have been coming out [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2813.0s)]
*  Comparatively the allegations against me. I think now we see we're just like kind of ridiculous, you know, I cracked my knuckles [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2819.04s)]
*  And mind you it was going to the strip club [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2826.96s)]
*  It doesn't say that I did anything like I didn't do anything to anyone in that strip club [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2830.4s)]
*  I just went to the strip club and then like being fat phobic for firing someone for gaining weight [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2834.08s)]
*  That just wasn't true. But that was hilarious. It wasn't true though. No, but just it was hilarious just to read [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2838.92s)]
*  Right, but I but I also have to say like one of my fears is I don't want my [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2850.36s)]
*  Situation and my lawsuit to be an indicator on any other that's going on [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2856.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't want it to invalidate any other actual because I will always stand for real victims of [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2861.96s)]
*  Sexual harassment and sexual violence and anything and I will always stand for them arrive for them [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2868.2400000000002s)]
*  So I don't want what happened to me to kind of invalidate anything else going on in the world [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2873.4s)]
*  And that was really important to me, which is why I was quiet for a long time because I still want to protect victims [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2877.8s)]
*  Not change you right how does that not change Liz was a person right did though because now do you still go out with people [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2883.08s)]

*  Something that I don't even know about but I feel like I readied myself now [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2912.3199999999997s)]

*  And it was really weird and I got a crash course and being an arena level artist a big artist [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2951.92s)]
*  Like after literally being an indie artist for ten years and being in isolation for two years [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2958.88s)]
*  So by the time I was running a arena level operation, I didn't have no practice in that [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2964.72s)]
*  I didn't have no experiences and I learned the hard way how to be a boss [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2971.16s)]
*  But I'm gonna be a better boss for it and I'm really proud of myself [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=2975.8399999999997s)]

*  I was undeniable and that created the trend of checking boxes [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3222.76s)]
*  I don't disagree that at a certain point we we started checking boxes [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3227.66s)]
*  When it comes to checking a box of black fat woman, I'm a ride for that every time I don't care [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3232.58s)]

*  So if it's already out there why she can't say what's already out there because here's the thing when it when it when the [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3634.56s)]
*  Stories came out before they leaked it wasn't Iman saying hey here is what happened [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3640.3199999999997s)]
*  Here is what we walked away with there were just stories in the little sneaky with it [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3645.24s)]
*  Just a little sneakier with it. Obviously well [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3648.8799999999997s)]

*  that's what she's a lesson in that first clip and the reason why I played that is because Iman is saying that because she [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3651.3599999999997s)]
*  Chose to get online and talk about the present the provisions and all these things that they you know came to terms on it [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3657.08s)]

*  Circumstances privacy safety security of the parties and their minor children and he's saying that it actually [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3664.24s)]
*  Resulted in him suffering a loss of income and damage to his personal professional reputation [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3669.6s)]

*  I understand but calling for her to get locked up. That's that's a bit much [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3675.62s)]
*  I think the way because also to when you go when you say a person is in contempt [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3679.3599999999997s)]
*  There's consequences to the contempt and these are just what that's what that's what a sign [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3684.0s)]
*  That is what is assigned with this. So it's not like he's making I want her to go to jail like she's supposed to go [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3687.56s)]
*  I mean if you say she's in contempt of court, you know, those are the consequences [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3692.64s)]

*  This is going too far. Oh [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3701.4s)]
*  Calling for this [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3703.44s)]
*  Well, this is if you know that there these are the consequences as stated [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3704.64s)]
*  We all agree to this and then you go and say she violated this agreement [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3708.76s)]
*  You can't say that you're not asking for it to happen because you're saying she violated she violated [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3713.08s)]

*  By him and his attorneys going is something to a judge she is in contempt of court [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3722.52s)]
*  You are asking for whatever consequences come with that contempt to penalty [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3726.84s)]
*  20 days [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3731.8s)]
*  If you ask for it that is the penalty and that's what what he's not saying put her in jail [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3732.84s)]
*  Well, I get what y'all saying [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3738.0800000000004s)]

*  Yes, but the reason why this is being picked up that way because according to him because she didn't she could be looking at [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3747.76s)]
*  20 days in jail and a fine but [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=3753.6800000000003s)]

*  For example, they will say is donald trump accepting this plane from cutter illegal [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4082.52s)]
*  Then they debate it and then we the people are sitting back at home not processing the information the way that we should because we [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4088.2s)]

*  Okay now in the constitution [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4151.72s)]

*  They don't pay people on time and that was the problem the real problem was after 12 o'clock [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4640.700000000001s)]
*  They would have to pay their staff a whole for another time [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4644.9400000000005s)]

*  He is listed as the owner, but he ain't even man. This that's that's horrible [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4661.1s)]

*  That's another black owned comedy club [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4675.900000000001s)]
*  But you know that's more intimate more small [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4677.66s)]
*  I would have to do more shows to make them the amount of money that I make now like that that that was me [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4679.5s)]
*  I'm sorry. You had that experience, you know, you know, it's not hard supporting black owned businesses [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4685.82s)]
*  It's hard supporting terribly ran businesses and the problem with terribly ran businesses [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4690.22s)]
*  You don't know they terribly ran until you do business with them, right? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4694.7s)]
*  And that's why it's so important for the business to be up to par because if not you won't get a terrible review [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4697.58s)]
*  Like just just gave this comedy club in detroit. Absolutely. The sad thing is I actually I dj'd there before but I didn't deal with the club [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4703.26s)]
*  Yeah, I dealt with [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4709.9800000000005s)]
*  Uh, I guess the alphas who rented the club out and hired me to perform [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4711.82s)]
*  So when I went there, I didn't have to deal with management and nothing and everybody was friendly and nice [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4716.22s)]
*  But it sucks that you you know, like you said it you you want to go to a black owned business and the sad thing [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4719.82s)]
*  About it is is I love comedy [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4723.9s)]
*  So I go to comedy clubs all over the place and it's very hard to find a black owned comedy comedy show [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4725.42s)]
*  That's been in business for a long time [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4730.219999999999s)]
*  So when you see one you want to support and if people are not having a great time and comedians and not having to [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4731.58s)]
*  Respect that they feel like they deserve or that they should get yeah, absolutely positively [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4736.54s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's the the black own part though. It's just a terribly ran part [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4740.94s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? Because none of us have a problem supporting black owned. Yeah, because like I said punch line [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4744.86s)]
*  That's right black owned they they treat me with such grace. They love me. They appreciate me [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4749.5s)]
*  Yo [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4754.38s)]
*  If it was not for my fans and the servers that was overworked [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4754.62s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? Like because they got they run in it's like two or three different sides to one mic [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4758.22s)]
*  So they got all of them working on this side the comedy club [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4762.06s)]
*  So it's just like it's in a beautiful area it's downtown [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4767.5s)]
*  But it's like it's not ran by the right people and me and my fans were handled terribly like you know what I mean? [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4770.3s)]
*  So I just I would never ever go back never and that's that's she won't go back because it's terribly ran [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4775.98s)]
*  Yes, and mike epps should get his name off that period. All right, that's a bad reflection of him [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4780.94s)]
*  Well, let's open up the phone lines 800 585 105 1. Do you find it harder to support black owned businesses? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4785.9s)]

*  Oh my god, shut up mellow [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4848.94s)]
*  honestly [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4851.26s)]
*  I'm actually very passionate about this topic because I had some very bad experiences with some black owned businesses [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4851.98s)]
*  And I feel as though black owned businesses nine times out of ten [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4857.9s)]
*  Are just using that phrase as a marketing scheme and they don't put any credibility behind those words now granted [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4861.259999999999s)]
*  I understand us as black people we like to work off the border system. That's that's nothing new you feel me? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4866.54s)]
*  So up to black customers we have to be more like [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4871.099999999999s)]
*  Accessible and more versatile with working black owned businesses, but at the same time black owned businesses [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4875.799999999999s)]
*  Y'all really need to know the definition the denotated definition of the word customer service [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4880.78s)]
*  Because y'all just be out here throwing fees on because you sound cool [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4885.259999999999s)]
*  Y'all be doing stuff for aesthetic and y'all marketing gets them in the door, but y'all don't keep them in there [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4888.78s)]
*  Because I don't know how to brand y'all products. Yeah, you feel me? But that's the conversation for another day. You heard thanks mellow. Hello, who's this? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4893.1s)]
*  Hi, this is tanae. Hey tanae. Good morning. We're asking do you find it harder to support black owned businesses? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4900.14s)]
*  Okay, i'm not gonna put all black businesses in one category, but it is hard sometimes [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4906.3s)]
*  I feel like they don't sometimes [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4912.22s)]
*  They don't realize that they have to put back in their business to invest to put the resources to excel [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4915.34s)]
*  If that makes sense, okay [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4922.94s)]
*  So you feel like they don't they don't put the money back into the business to make the business better, right? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4924.22s)]
*  Like in certain software systems out there that can make your you know business fun more smoothly [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4928.22s)]
*  Um hire more people [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4933.98s)]
*  Best in training is there so many resources out there that I feel like we lack [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4936.3s)]
*  Sometimes it does make it hard the beauty industry is a whole other [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4941.82s)]
*  But it is it is difficult to know. Okay. Thank you. Hello. Who's this? Hey, this is t [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4947.02s)]
*  Hey t good morning. Good morning. Hey [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4954.54s)]
*  So we're talking about is it harder to support a black owned business and you own a black owned business, correct? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4964.38s)]
*  I own a black owned business. I have a balloon business out in Connecticut. It's called call me a wallflower [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4968.54s)]
*  So basically, I mean as a black business owner, I truly want to support black owned businesses [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4976.14s)]
*  But sometimes it's tough. I've dealt with like like arrivals for communication [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4982.14s)]
*  I've been on cars [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4987.5s)]
*  And i've even had to start coming like some of the vendors [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4990.860000000001s)]
*  um, like two hours earlier just to keep [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4994.14s)]
*  Their [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4997.660000000001s)]
*  Like keep them on track because I just don't trust that they're going to arrive at the time that they should arrive [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=4998.620000000001s)]
*  So that's why in my business I show up about an hour early [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5004.620000000001s)]
*  Before like the client even tells me if they tell me five o'clock is our start time. I'm there by four [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5009.02s)]
*  um, and you know, i'm sometimes there before them, um [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5015.1s)]
*  I make sure I communicate very clearly and I make sure there's never room for any uncertainty because professionalism matters [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5019.26s)]
*  As much as the passion, okay. Well, thank you mama. You're welcome. Have a good day guys, you know [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5025.74s)]
*  You know, I think uh, the biggest problem [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5031.26s)]
*  Sometimes with with with black owned businesses is we take each other for granted [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5034.22s)]
*  Uh, we tend to be so hard on each other and we don't treat each other with the same respect [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5038.86s)]
*  Our gratitude and i'm talking about both ways the person who owns the business and the customer who's coming [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5043.42s)]
*  Into this, you know facility like the way we talk to each other [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5048.38s)]
*  We wouldn't talk to white folks like that the things we expect from each other [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5051.26s)]
*  We wouldn't expect that from white people. I wish that we approached each other the same way we approach [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5054.3s)]
*  Establishments period like don't walk in here thinking because it's a black owned business you're supposed to get treated in a different way [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5059.8s)]
*  It's just it's a business [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5066.22s)]
*  But I will say this I do take an understanding like for instance if I go to a black owned restaurant and there's a problem with my food [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5067.5s)]
*  I'll accept it faster, right? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5074.14s)]
*  And the reason I accept it fast is because I feel like a lot of times you can tell when a business is a mom [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5075.900000000001s)]
*  And pop owned and it's out their own pocket and they might not have things that other places can have they might not be able [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5081.02s)]
*  To get the loans that other businesses can have so sometimes I just sit and I eat it and I just won't go back [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5086.9400000000005s)]
*  You shouldn't accept that. I know but if i'm at a if i'm at a white restaurant and it's something that I don't like [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5091.42s)]
*  I'll send it back immediately and ask him to take it up the bill because I understand we don't have the [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5095.34s)]
*  The resources sometimes we don't have the finances sometimes and a lot of times we don't have the the people working in those businesses [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5099.34s)]
*  So I do understand that but that's what I mean when I say we don't treat each other with the same respect [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5105.26s)]
*  Our gratitude, right? Because the reality of the situation is I know this is a black owned business [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5110.54s)]
*  But if my stuff ain't right, it's not right and I gotta let you know that because I want you to get it right, right [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5115.099999999999s)]
*  If you just sit there and be and eat the food, they don't know what they did wrong [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5121.0199999999995s)]
*  They don't know what they did right. They don't know what they did wrong [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5124.379999999999s)]
*  There's a reason that if you go to most restaurants they give you customer reviews and they want to know what it is [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5126.299999999999s)]
*  They're doing right what it is they're doing wrong [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5130.94s)]
*  But sometimes I feel bad because I know they might not be be able to afford afford to lose that [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5132.62s)]
*  $40 state they might not be able to afford to lose that lobster tail or that burger or whatever [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5137.26s)]
*  Maybe they might not be able to afford to lose that so you feel a little bad and you just hope that they they figure it out [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5142.700000000001s)]
*  But you know what else they can't afford to lose a repeat customer. You're right. They want you to keep coming back [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5148.14s)]
*  So you got to tell these folks what's wrong so they can get it right and they can raise they uh, they they stand [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5152.620000000001s)]
*  And I wonder how many black owned businesses are the this is the first time that they created this business [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5158.38s)]
*  See a lot of times a lot of these other businesses are they have restaurants in their family [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5163.18s)]
*  They have these type of stores in their family [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5167.58s)]
*  So they they're tried and true already a lot of times for us [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5169.18s)]
*  This is our first time and we're just trying to make it happen off a whim [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5172.14s)]
*  You know, I mean and trying to figure it out as we go along. Oh, you gotta get it, right? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5174.700000000001s)]
*  So I know it is it is kind of a strange question because it's not hard supporting black owned businesses. Not for me [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5178.14s)]
*  It's hard supporting terribly ran businesses. I agree, but you gotta learn like I [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5185.18s)]
*  Owned a car wash at one time right and when one of my guys was [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5191.0199999999995s)]
*  Vacuuming somebody's car. I didn't know that you had to [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5195.42s)]
*  Actually have the the vacuum screwed down [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5199.26s)]
*  So when he went to vacuum the car the vacuum fell on the guy's car and I had to pay to fix that car [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5201.98s)]
*  But I didn't know anything about it [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5206.46s)]
*  But you know somebody who owned car washes before would know better than I would you say what now? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5208.14s)]
*  She was watching somebody you try to wash somebody's car with a vacuum. I own the car [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5213.18s)]
*  Wash [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5216.3s)]
*  No, I own the car wash and as they were cleaning the inside of the car the vacuum fell off and hit the guy's car [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5219.9800000000005s)]
*  And then in the car, right? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5224.3s)]
*  So you had to screw them in but I wouldn't have known to screw it in because i've never owned the car [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5225.74s)]
*  Car wash before see you heard screw it in and you got excited [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5229.74s)]
*  Screw what in forget it man? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5233.820000000001s)]
*  The holes to the vacuum the holes to the vacuum [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5235.820000000001s)]
*  I didn't know like there's things that you don't know that you figure out as they happen [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5239.58s)]
*  Now that customer would never come back to my car wash but you know those type of things you [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5243.82s)]
*  Come back to your car wash if you was white too [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5248.3s)]
*  You understand i'm saying unless you did he wouldn't come back unless you did something to fix [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5251.0199999999995s)]
*  Directify that situation. I mean I did fix it [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5255.18s)]
*  But I didn't know but somebody who owned a car wash before would know all of these things before because they know from family [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5257.1s)]
*  They know for for being tried and true. I was just trying to figure it out on my own [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5262.86s)]
*  Yeah, but like I said earlier man, you know, it's not hard to put in black owned businesses [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5266.22s)]
*  It's just a hard support and terribly ran businesses. I don't expect anything from a business except quality [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5269.5s)]
*  I don't expect anything from a business except good customer service whatever business I support if the quality isn't up the par [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5274.06s)]
*  I'm not dealing with it. All right. Well, we got the latest with lauren coming up. Don't move. It's the breakfast club [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5279.34s)]
*  Good morning. Morning everybody is dj envy just hilarious charlomane the guy we are the breakfast club. Let's get to the latest with lauren [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5283.5s)]
*  lauren becoming a straight face [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5291.5s)]
*  She gets him from somebody that knows somebody she gets the details [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5294.7s)]
*  I'm a homegirl that knows a little bit about everything [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5297.98s)]
*  She'd be having the latest on this [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5300.94s)]
*  The latest with lauren la rosa sometimes you have facts sometimes you have details sometimes you have a little bit every time [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5304.22s)]
*  on the breakfast club talk to me [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5310.46s)]
*  All right, y'all so remember in here we talked about that druski lawsuit. There was a woman that was alleging that druski oda bukham jr [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5313.1s)]
*  and didi [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5319.74s)]
*  sexually assault to her [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5320.94s)]
*  Now when I talked about this last I told y'all that I had seen uh phone records and bank records that then it came out [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5322.62s)]
*  That you know what I saw then came out in the media that um showed that druski number one had no money [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5328.46s)]
*  He was not a celebrity. He was not hanging with celebrities at the time [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5334.54s)]
*  Um from what these documents were alleging and there were phone records that placed him in georgia [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5337.099999999999s)]
*  During the time that this assault would have happened now the full filing was actually [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5341.66s)]
*  Uh published and made available over the weekend [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5347.18s)]
*  So I went back and I looked just because a lot of times in the full filings like there might be more information [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5350.299999999999s)]
*  And there was so in this full filing there was actually a police report [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5354.219999999999s)]
*  Um that druski's team is pointing to and this police report that they attach as an exhibit [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5358.54s)]
*  So you can actually read the police report was filed by this alleged victim in a california court [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5363.179999999999s)]
*  And it would have been during the time that the sexual assault that she alleges happened happened [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5368.62s)]
*  So she's basically saying that there there were two men that sexually assaulted her [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5373.58s)]
*  Same time same day, but not druski not odell not odell beckham jr and not diddy [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5378.62s)]
*  So why she call their name then and what happens now that we find out she lied on those people [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5384.46s)]
*  Well, let me get to it because there's another thing too before I address that another thing as well is in this same filing [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5389.58s)]
*  They attach a job offer from longhorn steakhouse in georgia [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5395.82s)]
*  The day that the sexual assault would have happened was the day that druski accepted that job [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5400.0599999999995s)]
*  So he and they're doing this a show that he was not you know the legend like he wasn't even in uh, california now to answer [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5403.5s)]
*  Your question. Yeah, we know the druski part is capped. We knew that from the beginning [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5409.5s)]
*  But what happens to that young lady now that we know she got caught in a lie [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5412.3s)]
*  Why would she even mention why would she just bring up the people odell beckham druski? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5416.14s)]
*  Why so druski's attorneys are asking for her and her attorneys to be sanctioned, which what I mean locked up [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5420.7s)]
*  Um, it depends on what uh what the court wants to levy like what? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5427.26s)]
*  Consequences the court wants to give but they want them to get in trouble [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5431.099999999999s)]
*  Anyway, yeah, it can be a penalty. It can be you can be stripped of certain things [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5434.78s)]
*  It just depends on how to judge the side to pay a fine or she should go to jail [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5437.66s)]
*  And then they are also asking that this lawsuit just be dismissed in total [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5441.42s)]
*  Um now I did reach out to the attorney for the accuser [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5445.339999999999s)]
*  And the attorney told me that this is a procedurally improper motion [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5449.099999999999s)]
*  Basically that this motion is not correct and that they look forward to litigating this in court [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5452.62s)]
*  Your lawyer you gotta know your client is lying [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5457.02s)]
*  If you don't know your client is lying at this point, then we gotta start questioning you and your credentials crazy [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5459.5s)]
*  Like seriously, like why do we keep letting people get away with this type of stuff and how do [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5463.900000000001s)]
*  Reputable lawyers I would think they're reputable lawyers take these kind of cases on i'm not for certain [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5468.200000000001s)]
*  I'm not for sure but in the following druski team mentions like yo a quick, you know, like [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5473.02s)]
*  Conversation with your client or you know certain searches just there's a lot of things you guys could have done before we got [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5478.92s)]
*  To this point where you're throwing this on him and this could have caused, you know [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5483.74s)]
*  Brand deal harm and you know, like there's just so much when you throw so like allegations like this, right? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5487.5s)]
*  And when you when you're in court and you lie, right? You're held in contempt, right? You can't lie technically. So like [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5492.46s)]
*  What is it? Well, I guess the difference would be [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5499.66s)]
*  That they're not in a courtroom because that's the same thing [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5502.139999999999s)]
*  That's what they're doing [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5504.46s)]
*  They're lying the allegations and then they prove when it's proven that they're lying [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5505.099999999999s)]
*  That it should be some type so it's no law like no type of [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5509.42s)]
*  Nothing set for these people to have to pay for what they did [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5513.74s)]
*  So there are rules and that's what druski's team is talking about like yo based on the rules of the court as an attorney [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5517.58s)]
*  It's kind of like the same thing with the jay-z situation like jay-z's attorney came out and said yo [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5522.94s)]
*  If you're an attorney we're trusting that you're doing things fairly and that you're doing things in good faith and that you're actually [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5527.0199999999995s)]
*  Investigating these things before you bring it in a lawsuit in front of a judge [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5532.12s)]
*  And because you didn't follow these rules of the court there are consequences that a judge can love you [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5535.9s)]
*  But the judge decides what the consequences are going to be because you know, they just ask for it to happen [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5540.46s)]
*  You're not just bringing this stuff in front of a judge [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5543.82s)]
*  You're bringing this stuff in front of the court of public opinion now [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5545.42s)]
*  My reputation is damaged now my brand is damaged now i'm losing all types of money and you just get to walk away [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5547.58s)]
*  Yeah, because people will believe the lie [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5552.86s)]
*  And run with that. Yeah, and and that's what happens too and brands don't really care to do their own research [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5555.42s)]
*  And you know what I mean? It's just they don't have time the social media reacts so fast now [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5560.06s)]
*  Following a lawsuit. I just looked this up because I wanted to make sure I stated this filing a lawsuit based on a false based on false [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5564.22s)]
*  Information can lead to serious consequences including dismissal of the case [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5568.86s)]
*  Which is what drusk is asking for fines just to your point [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5571.9s)]
*  Um, even criminal charges like perjury if the court finds out that the information was knowingly false [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5575.0199999999995s)]
*  The case can be dismissed and the plaintiff may be penalized for wasting the court's resources and causing harm to the defendant [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5578.94s)]
*  And even it goes, you know as far as the even even a line under oath [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5584.94s)]
*  So we'll just have to wait to see what happens and how the judge responds. Okay [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5588.139999999999s)]
*  All right. Well, that was the latest with lauren. Yes, and listen [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhuDX8iL4bQ&t=5593.0199999999995s)]
