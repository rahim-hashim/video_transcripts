*  She was indicted on two counts of obstructing a federal agency and concealing an undocumented [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=269.78s)]
*  Immigrant who had a criminal hearing in her courtroom now Dugan was arrested by the FBI back in April [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=275.26s)]
*  A federal grand jury indicted her earlier this week and her trial is set to begin on July 21st [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=281.18s)]
*  Now according to the FBI the man she was allegedly trying to help was previously deported in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=287.58s)]
*  2013 but he re-entered the US illegally and was later accused of battery [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  Immigration officials had planned to arrest him after his court hearing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=298.62s)]
*  But agents say someone took photos of the arrest team and showed it to the judge while she was in court and when that hearing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=301.94s)]
*  Ended witnesses say the judge told the man to follow her and led him and his attorney out of the courtroom through a private door [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=308.36s)]
*  To avoid agents. The man was later spotted in the courtroom [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=314.48s)]
*  He ran from agents, but he was caught outside after a brief foot chase now Dugan's attorney [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=318.76s)]
*  They were surrounded he wasn't gonna get far [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=325.48s)]
*  Dugan's attorney said he's she's innocent and she was acting with her within her role as a judge [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=328.36s)]
*  her legal team is trying to get the case dismissed arguing she has immunity and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  The arrest violates the Constitution. Did they have a relationship like was that was like her landscape was something my boyfriend [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=338.24s)]
*  She just felt like a good Samaritan [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=344.40000000000003s)]
*  I think it was just she wanted to be a good Samaritan [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  But you can't do that right? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  You can't know that they're gonna pick him up and then say sneak out the back door because if it would have been anybody else [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  They'd have got locked up [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=353.36s)]
*  But this sets a precedent because when do you when do you arrest a sitting judge in her courtroom? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=354.44s)]
*  So that's what everybody's up in arms about is that that she's you know, she's been arrested by the FBI [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=360.04s)]
*  If she's convicted she's facing two charges one felony one misdemeanor [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=366.44s)]
*  And that is up to six years in prison [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=371.0s)]
*  That is interesting because I'm just sitting there trying to think what was her plan [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  Like where was she trying to get uh, you know, this this individual to go and was she? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=376.5s)]
*  I don't want to win abusing her power be the right word being that she knows [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=380.64s)]
*  She's the judge that she probably was thinking they're not gonna arrest me if I stand in the way [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=384.24s)]
*  I think she's gonna get caught she said go out the back door. How'd he go? I just let him out this way [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=388.24s)]
*  You know I mean, yeah [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=391.94s)]
*  Through a private exit, okay [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=394.14s)]
*  So and then I know you guys have been covering the the Newark air traffic controller situation [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=395.86s)]
*  And so there is a second air traffic control facility in the u.s [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=401.38s)]
*  Experience that experienced about a 90 second communications outage this week [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=405.7s)]
*  It happened on Monday at the Denver air route traffic control center [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=410.06s)]
*  Which manages airspace over Colorado and nearby states now during this outage as many as 20 pilots over the Denver airspace [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=414.42s)]
*  Could not talk to air traffic controllers Frank McIntosh. He is the deputy chief operating officer for the FAA [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=422.14000000000004s)]
*  He testified yesterday at the house transportation and infrastructure committee that one of the controllers main radio frequencies failed [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=429.58000000000004s)]
*  Then they switched to a backup and that one failed too for nearly two minutes. He was grilled by rep Hank Johnson [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=436.86s)]
*  About the shortage of air traffic controllers and let's just listen to that exchange [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=444.38s)]
*  How many people how many air traffic controllers have left the system since [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=449.02s)]
*  January 20th of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=455.74s)]
*  2025 I'm not aware of how many have retired but so could it have been a hundred [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=457.78000000000003s)]
*  It could have been one it could have been a thousand could have been five thousand. No, maybe twenty five hundred [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=463.74s)]
*  No [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=470.94s)]
*  2000 I don't believe so sir. I track how many air traffic controllers will tell us how many have left their jobs since January 20th [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=472.94s)]

*  it out. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=995.1s)]
*  The girl Kelsey came out and said, hey, I committed the crime. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=996.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=999.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1000.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1001.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1002.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1003.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1004.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1005.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1006.1s)]
*  I'm going to do it. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1007.1s)]
*  Hey, I committed the crime. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1008.46s)]
*  That it would be an equivalence. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1009.46s)]
*  This is what you're doing is a false equivalence. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1010.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1011.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1012.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1013.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1014.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1015.46s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1016.46s)]
*  So what about right when you said, well, he'd be judged by a jury of his peers. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1017.46s)]
*  So it said be retrial. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1018.46s)]
*  That's like Trump said the same thing. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1019.46s)]
*  Like they'd be judged by a jury of their peers. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1020.46s)]
*  Why would we go at it again? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1021.46s)]
*  I'm saying that based off the due process and all the evidence that was presented, the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1022.46s)]
*  simple question I asked was if Tory Lanez and his attorneys knew all of that evidence [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1024.8600000000001s)]
*  was against Tory, why wouldn't he simply say that? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1029.8600000000001s)]
*  Why would Meg? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1033.62s)]
*  What reason would Meg have to say Kelsey didn't shoot her? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1034.62s)]
*  I mean that Kelsey shot. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1037.62s)]
*  Because you know, it's about girl feminists in the end, girl power. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1038.62s)]
*  You know, you got your feminists too. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1041.62s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1042.62s)]
*  Hey, yo, but I love all of y'all, man. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1043.62s)]
*  Laurence, she's done a good job with the trial. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1044.62s)]
*  Jess is beautiful, man. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1045.62s)]

*  Have a good one, brother. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1060.3799999999999s)]
*  Get it off your chest. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1061.3799999999999s)]
*  Eight on drink. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1062.3799999999999s)]
*  Five eight five one. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1063.3799999999999s)]
*  One on five one. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  We are the only society that will ignore evidence just for he said she said. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  It's the weirdest thing to me. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1071.02s)]
*  I was wondering how the bodyguard thing wouldn't be hearsay. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1072.5s)]
*  Because he's overhearing the conversation and we can't even clarify. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1075.9799999999998s)]
*  I've been asking some people, they ain't answering me yet. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1080.6999999999998s)]
*  But that's all it is. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1083.1799999999998s)]
*  The bodyguard said he overheard her say these things. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1084.3799999999999s)]
*  So as he said, you ignore all the evidence that was in court that took years and weeks [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1087.02s)]
*  the process to believe the bodyguard. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1092.1s)]
*  You can still use that as evidence, but the court is over. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1094.22s)]
*  So you'd have to go through so many procedures to even get back to that position, appellate [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1096.22s)]
*  courts and all that. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  People think he's going to be out tomorrow. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1101.1399999999999s)]
*  You're right. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1103.1399999999999s)]
*  But do you understand what I'm saying? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1104.1399999999999s)]
*  I understand exactly what you're saying. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1105.1399999999999s)]
*  People ignore evidence that took years and weeks of due process that people actually [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1106.1399999999999s)]
*  investigated and jurors took time to go through. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1110.98s)]
*  But one bodyguard says, well, I heard and now that's who y'all. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1114.5s)]
*  That's so that y'all believe that? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1118.78s)]
*  Because these social media detectives are breaking it down for people and people believe [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1120.46s)]
*  it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1123.66s)]
*  There's no facts. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1124.66s)]
*  This is what they believe in and they be talking like they know facts. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1125.66s)]
*  It happens all day long on this thing. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1127.7s)]
*  And I wasn't there. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1129.46s)]
*  I mean, listen, I don't know what happened. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1130.46s)]
*  I'm just simply saying, why would you ignore the courts and all the evidence as opposed [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1131.46s)]
*  to either why would you believe this one bodyguard who just overheard something? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1135.86s)]
*  I agree. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1139.38s)]
*  Do you just need facts? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1140.38s)]
*  Speaking of facts, you was at the trial yesterday. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1142.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1144.7s)]
*  And a lot of facts are getting misconstrued or something because the prosecution had Cassie [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1145.7s)]
*  looking crazy yesterday. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1149.42s)]
*  I called you yesterday. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1150.42s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1151.42s)]
*  I think so. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1152.42s)]
*  I didn't get your phone call. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1153.42s)]
*  I thought that was the defense yesterday. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1154.42s)]
*  It was the defense that she was speaking to, but I feel like the prosecution did not. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1155.42s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1159.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1160.82s)]
*  For that to be the star witness, they ain't set her up the right way at all. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1161.82s)]
*  Maybe they didn't pepper. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1163.3s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1164.3s)]
*  It was like there was things that she. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1165.3s)]
*  Oh, you mean you come back and you guys look over it. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1166.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1167.3s)]
*  We'll come back and there's a lot, y'all. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1168.3s)]
*  I have one question for you. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1169.3s)]
*  Did he overdose? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1170.3s)]
*  Did Cassie be charged because the way that they breaking it down, it seems like she was [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1171.62s)]
*  part of the. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1175.1s)]
*  What you mean seems like? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1176.1s)]
*  She was for sure. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1177.1s)]
*  I told y'all yesterday she was G-Money that did these near brown. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1178.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it seemed like. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1179.1s)]
*  Okay, so why is it here we were talking about it? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1180.1s)]
*  Because I said that I felt like if she wasn't testifying for them, she would be sitting right [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1181.1s)]
*  where Puff is at right now. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1184.78s)]

*  She gets into somebody that knows somebody. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1215.18s)]

*  She be having the latest on her. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1218.18s)]
*  The latest with Lauren LaRosa. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1219.18s)]
*  Sometimes you have facts, sometimes you have details. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1220.18s)]
*  She's a little bit of a [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1221.18s)]
*  So yesterday in court was Cassie's first day of cross-examination. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1224.76s)]
*  So that's where Puff's team gets to ask her questions about her testimony and just different [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1241.44s)]
*  things that they want the jury to hear. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1245.68s)]
*  I don't know what the prosecutors are doing. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1250.8799999999999s)]
*  They did such a good job the day before of laying out what they had and establishing [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1253.08s)]
*  why their charges make sense, even though I don't think that it's as gut wrenching as [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1256.84s)]
*  they've made it seem from all the indictments and stuff like that. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1261.3s)]
*  But y'all, the way that Cassie was looking on that thing yesterday, first of all, they [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1263.76s)]
*  debunked so many different things just speaking to her credibility, right? [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1268.52s)]
*  Not getting into the force and all that yet, right? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1271.96s)]
*  Just speaking to her credibility. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1274.32s)]
*  Y'all know, understand, the day before she told that story about Suge Knight and Puff [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1275.32s)]
*  allegedly grabbing guns and going to run into Suge Knight at Mel's diner. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1281.12s)]
*  And he left from a free call to do that, according to her, right? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1285.4399999999998s)]
*  So according to the defense team and the interview that Cassie did with the prosecutors before [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1289.08s)]
*  she got on the stand, like in the beginning of the investigations, that story was completely [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1295.2399999999998s)]
*  not true that she sat on the stand the day before that. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1300.34s)]
*  So how did they debunk that? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  So they basically asked her, they said, Hey, you remember yesterday you testified that [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  you stayed in your home and you were upset and that Puff had allegedly left from a free [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1307.96s)]
*  call and blah, blah, blah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1312.6000000000001s)]
*  They went down what she said. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1313.6000000000001s)]
*  Then she was like, yeah. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1314.6000000000001s)]
*  And they said, well, do you remember, they ran down the date, the date that you spoke [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1315.6000000000001s)]
*  to the prosecutors and you told them that you were forced to get into a car. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1319.2s)]
*  You were crying, you were upset, but you didn't have a choice according to you, right? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1323.52s)]
*  Like you were like basically forced to get in this car to go with them to run into Suge [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1326.96s)]
*  Knight. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1330.68s)]
*  And she was like, I never said that. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1331.68s)]
*  And they said, okay, well, we have the transcripts from your interview with the prosecutors right [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1333.3600000000001s)]
*  here. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1336.8s)]
*  She pauses for a moment. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1337.96s)]
*  She said, I don't know why this would say that because I've always said that I didn't [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1338.96s)]
*  go. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1341.24s)]
*  And I'm like, but it's a, it's an interview with prosecutors. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1342.24s)]
*  So it looks crazy. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1345.84s)]
*  And there were just, there was so many moments like that where you shouldn't try to remember [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1347.56s)]
*  nothing when you was on drugs. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1350.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1352.52s)]
*  When you try to recall things when you're on drugs. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1353.52s)]
*  No, now let me talk about that because I thought about that too. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1355.96s)]
*  Like, you know, she said a lot yesterday and the day before that about how much they were [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1359.2s)]
*  using drugs. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1363.6s)]
*  So some things may be a little hazy for her. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1364.6s)]
*  She couldn't remember some of the escorts names that they knew that she had slept with. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1366.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1369.84s)]
*  So she remembered a lot of them. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1370.84s)]
*  Cause they were using a lot of them for a long period of time and taking them to different [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1373.24s)]
*  states. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1378.2s)]
*  But drug use. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1379.2s)]
*  So there was a time in 2017 where things were like super, super hazy. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1381.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1385.2s)]
*  And she on the stand said, I really don't remember much from this time. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1386.2s)]
*  Cause there was something else that they were talking to her about. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1388.52s)]
*  And she, it was just all over the place and she wasn't sounding like she was telling the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1390.12s)]
*  truth. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1393.28s)]
*  So they're talking to her about the drug use. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1394.52s)]
*  And the day before, remember I told you guys, they were asking her about the drug use and [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1396.6s)]
*  asking her how she would resupply on drugs. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1400.16s)]
*  Like who gave her the drug dealer's contacts and stuff like that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1403.04s)]
*  And she said Diddy. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1405.36s)]
*  And when she said that, I watched Diddy in court look at her like, girl, what? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1406.84s)]
*  Yesterday on the stand, they said, okay, so let's talk about your drug use. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1411.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1415.6s)]
*  Because is it or is it not true that, you know, both of you guys were using drugs, but [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1416.6s)]
*  like Diddy was still able to run multiple businesses and like ran down a list of everything [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1420.6799999999998s)]
*  he was doing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  He was more functioning. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1425.6399999999999s)]
*  And she was like, yeah, I mean, you could say that. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1426.6399999999999s)]
*  And then they go into having a conversation about the fact that at one point in time, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1428.9599999999998s)]
*  Puff was calling drug dealers and telling them to stop serving Cassie because she was [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1432.9599999999998s)]
*  so bad off. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1437.56s)]
*  Like she was worse off on drugs than he was. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1438.56s)]
*  And Cassie admitted that that was happening. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1440.6399999999999s)]
*  The day before that though, they painted it as if she was like lost in this whole like [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1442.8799999999999s)]
*  drug abuse thing that was caused and spiraled out by Puff. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1447.4s)]
*  Yesterday, the conversation was, no, you were making choices on your own to the point where [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1452.24s)]
*  he was even having to intervene with some of her friends because he didn't like how [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1456.72s)]
*  much drugs she was doing. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1460.8400000000001s)]
*  He was trying to like protect the way that they were doing. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1462.2800000000002s)]
*  Like they were doing their things, but he was trying to make sure that it was from what [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1464.44s)]
*  they're alleging that it was a lot more safe and she didn't push back on it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1467.64s)]
*  I thought they were saying, I thought Diddy's team was saying that Diddy was also on drugs [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1470.48s)]
*  really bad and they were trying to say that's why he didn't remember putting hands on her. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1475.48s)]
*  But even said he OD'd. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1478.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1480.88s)]
*  So look, they never and this is why they're I'm saying the prosecution left their star [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1481.88s)]
*  witness out there looking crazy because Diddy's team has never ran from any of that. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1485.3200000000002s)]
*  They have talked about his drug use yesterday. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1488.3600000000001s)]
*  It did come up in court that he overdosed at this around the time that Whitney Houston [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1490.3600000000001s)]
*  passed away, right? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1494.1200000000001s)]
*  Was he rushed to the hospital when he overdosed? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1495.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they said they took him to the hospital. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1497.0800000000002s)]
*  It was like a whole thing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1498.4s)]
*  They didn't go into a lot of detail about it and I have been trying to get more information [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1499.4s)]
*  on that because for a lot of us in the courtroom, we were like, wait, what? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1502.38s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1506.14s)]
*  How did he overdose? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1507.14s)]
*  The world never knew. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1508.14s)]
*  But that's how bad their drug use was. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1509.14s)]
*  But he was always able to keep himself together and not fall off and able to try and go through [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1511.7600000000002s)]
*  withdrawals and stuff to get off of it. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1517.6200000000001s)]
*  She was having a bit of a harder time from what it seemed to the point where he was encouraging [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1519.4s)]
*  her to go to rehab and she admitted she did go to a wellness spa and things of that nature. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1523.2s)]
*  But I think the reason why I brought that up is because Puff's team did try and use [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1527.2600000000002s)]
*  that as a defense, right? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1530.6200000000001s)]
*  She tried to do that as well. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1532.38s)]
*  But the way that everything is coming out now is really seeming like, okay, what we [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1534.42s)]
*  saw happen to her in that video and the other things that I know happened to her because [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1540.98s)]
*  we've seen photos of the bruises and things like that, right? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1545.3s)]
*  Is not okay. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1547.72s)]
*  But the way that they were able to almost humanize, like, okay, he had a lot of drugs [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1549.22s)]
*  in him too. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1554.5s)]
*  If we're going to give her a pass for being drugged up and not being able to make her [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1555.5s)]
*  own decisions, we should have that conversation about him too is what they were able to accomplish. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1559.62s)]
*  They were both drugged up a lot. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1563.82s)]
*  And they used her to do it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1564.82s)]
*  This is what I was telling you, Lauren. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1566.3799999999999s)]
*  You got eight weeks. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1567.78s)]
*  You're going to go crazy because every day when the prosecution is on, prosecution is [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1568.78s)]
*  going to say things that make sense. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1572.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1573.58s)]
*  When the defense is on, the defense team is going to make things that make sense. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1574.58s)]
*  You're going to be playing hopscotch like, oh my. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1576.78s)]
*  Charlotte, look at this. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1578.3799999999999s)]
*  You got eight weeks. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1579.3799999999999s)]
*  I am like, if I was a juror, I would be so stressed out. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1580.3799999999999s)]
*  You should really do a book and documentary after this because you're there every day. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1583.26s)]
*  Next question, I was going to ask, could Cassie be charged? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1586.2199999999998s)]
*  Will they charge Cassie? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1588.42s)]
*  Because from what you're telling us, it was like... [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1590.1000000000001s)]
*  Baby girl was the number two. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1592.46s)]
*  She was number two and she was setting up... [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1593.74s)]
*  I told you all that yesterday. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1595.1000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday I said she was G-Money and Big Nino Brown. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1596.1000000000001s)]
*  The free co-ops and she allegedly supplied some of the drugs. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1598.42s)]
*  That's what it seems like they're saying. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1601.3400000000001s)]
*  So could she be charged as well? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1602.54s)]
*  I had asked some questions about that yesterday to a source who told me that they had heard [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1604.46s)]
*  that there were some conversations about immunity, which would only make sense. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1607.8600000000001s)]
*  But they can't 100% confirm it, but I'll have that by Monday. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1611.48s)]
*  I got so many questions. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1615.6200000000001s)]
*  You got to go. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1616.6200000000001s)]
*  We got to go. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1617.62s)]
*  We can come bring it back in this hour. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1618.62s)]
*  But he blow up Kid Cudi's car. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1619.62s)]
*  What happened with Michael B. Jordan? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1620.62s)]
*  Tell us! [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1621.62s)]
*  We got some more for the next hour. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1622.62s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1623.62s)]
*  Because some people got some strays. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1624.62s)]
*  What, Jess? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1625.62s)]
*  What happened? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1626.62s)]
*  It's Janet Jackson's birthday though, so happy birthday to the legend. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1627.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1631.62s)]
*  Janet don't want you mentioning her. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1632.62s)]
*  Not right now. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1633.62s)]
*  Janet is like, you can mention me anytime. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1634.62s)]
*  In a minute from now, but not right now. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1635.62s)]
*  You don't have to mention me right now. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1636.62s)]
*  So close to this story. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1637.62s)]
*  Yeah, just a little after. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1638.62s)]
*  Because you didn't have to do that. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1639.62s)]
*  Oh my... [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1640.62s)]
*  Who's that on your shirt? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1641.62s)]
*  Jess, wait back up. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1642.62s)]
*  Let me see your shirt. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1643.62s)]
*  Who's that on your shirt? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1645.62s)]
*  That looks like victim number seven. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1646.62s)]
*  That looks like the drug supplier. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1647.62s)]
*  That's who was supplying Diddy. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1648.62s)]
*  That's who was supplying Diddy and casting the drugs. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1649.62s)]
*  This is the picture that Snoop posted. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1652.62s)]
*  What's that on your head? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1655.62s)]
*  Huh? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1656.62s)]
*  What's that on your head? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1657.62s)]
*  On my head? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1658.62s)]
*  Yeah, what's that? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1659.62s)]
*  Oh, it's my ponytail. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1660.62s)]
*  My ponytail back then. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1661.62s)]
*  I've come a long way. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1662.62s)]
*  I want that in a lodge. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1663.62s)]
*  You better have that in here next week. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1664.62s)]
*  I need that. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1665.62s)]
*  I need one too. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1666.62s)]
*  Don't clip my end, Jeff Salarian. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1667.62s)]
*  Alright. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1669.62s)]
*  Now when we come back, Mimi will be joining us. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1671.62s)]
*  We got front page news. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1673.62s)]
*  So don't go anywhere. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1674.62s)]
*  It's the Breakfast Club. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1675.62s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1676.62s)]
*  Wake up. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1677.62s)]
*  You're locked into the Breakfast Club. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1678.62s)]
*  Morning everybody. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1679.62s)]
*  It's DJ, Envy, Jess, Hilarious, Charlamagne, the guy. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1680.62s)]
*  We are the Breakfast Club. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1683.62s)]
*  Let's get back to some front page news. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1685.62s)]
*  Again, the Nuggets beat the OKC. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1687.62s)]
*  Alright, 119-107. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1689.62s)]
*  They tied the series 3-3. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1691.62s)]
*  And yes, my Knicks play tonight. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1693.62s)]
*  So hopefully we can finish off these Celtics at home. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1695.62s)]
*  What's up, Mimi? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1698.62s)]
*  What's up, y'all? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1699.62s)]
*  Alright, so let's jump back into this. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1700.62s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the man tapped by Trump and House Republicans to lead the country's [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1702.62s)]
*  top public health agencies, he testified before Congress this week and he made one thing clear, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1707.62s)]
*  that he doesn't think Americans should take medical advice from him. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1712.62s)]
*  At a House Appropriations Committee hearing earlier this week, Kennedy was there to explain [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1715.62s)]
*  why he wants to slash the budgets for major health agencies like the CDC, the NIH, and the FDA. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1720.62s)]
*  But things took a turn when lawmakers asked him a simple question about vaccines, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1726.62s)]
*  whether he would vaccinate his own kids against measles. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1730.62s)]
*  Let's listen to what he had to say. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1733.62s)]
*  For measles, probably for measles. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1735.62s)]
*  You know, what I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1739.62s)]
*  You know, I don't want to seem like I'm being evasive. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1745.62s)]
*  But I don't think people should be taking advice, medical advice from me. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1748.62s)]
*  Right, no, I got that. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1752.62s)]
*  And I'm not asking you to give them medical advice, but would you vaccinate your child for measles? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1754.62s)]
*  I think if I answer that question directly, it will seem like I'm giving advice to other people, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1757.62s)]
*  and I don't want to be doing that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1763.62s)]
*  I want people to make that decision. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1765.62s)]
*  But that's kind of your jurisdiction, because CDC... [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1766.62s)]
*  I mean, that's an honest answer, because he's not a doctor. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1768.62s)]
*  And you don't have to be a doctor to be the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1770.62s)]
*  No, you don't. But if somebody asks you a question, will you, they just want your opinion. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1774.62s)]
*  Like somebody says, do you give your kids whatever? Yes. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1777.62s)]
*  Especially though, because he's telling other people to take vitamins. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1780.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1783.62s)]
*  But he's getting his kids the vaccination. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1784.62s)]
*  So that's what the big problem is. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1786.62s)]
*  So he never answered the question? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1788.62s)]
*  He never answered the question. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1789.62s)]
*  He also dodged the question about whether or not he should, if you should give your kids like a chicken pox and all those other vaccines. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1790.62s)]
*  But this is coming as the U.S. is facing the worst measles outbreak in years. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1799.62s)]
*  And then he went on to claim that the CDC is doing better than any other country at handling it, which is very, very questionable. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1803.62s)]
*  And so moving right along. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1811.62s)]
*  So if you're a Wal-Mart shopper, get ready. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1813.62s)]
*  Prices on some everyday items are about to go up this month. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1815.62s)]
*  The company says they are feeling the squeeze from the rising tariffs on imported goods like electronics, toys, strollers and even some food items. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1818.62s)]
*  And they cannot absorb all the extra costs. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1827.62s)]
*  So they're going to pass that on to the consumer. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1829.62s)]
*  The tariffs, they're, of course, part of Trump's trade policies, which products from countries like China, Costa Rica and Peru. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1832.62s)]
*  Now, even though some of the tariffs have been lowered, the remaining ones are still pushing up the cost of goods. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1839.62s)]
*  And that means higher prices for you at the checkout. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1846.62s)]
*  Now, Wal-Mart says the biggest price change will hit late May and into June. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1848.62s)]
*  So items again, strollers, mattresses, toys mostly made overseas. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1853.62s)]
*  Those will likely cost more. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1858.62s)]
*  The retail giant said is doing everything to keep prices low, especially on groceries. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1860.62s)]
*  But the trade wars hitting the retail industry very, very hard. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1864.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1868.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1869.62s)]
*  Now, thank you, Mimi. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1870.62s)]
*  Now you also have a podcast that you're doing, correct? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1871.62s)]
*  Correct. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1873.62s)]
*  Altadena with Love. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1874.62s)]
*  Now break down this podcast and what made you want to do this podcast. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1875.62s)]
*  So to Altadena with Love is like my love letter to the community of Altadena, which is right next to Pasadena. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1879.62s)]
*  Most people have heard of Pasadena, but not a lot of people had heard of Altadena, which is literally right next to Pasadena. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1885.62s)]
*  And the community of Altadena is a historic or was a historic black neighborhood that was burnt in the Eaton fire when, you know, in January when California was on fire. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1891.62s)]
*  I went there as a journalist just to cover the story. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1903.62s)]
*  And when I got there, I realized the devastation of the area. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1906.62s)]
*  And what I realized was everyone looked like me. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1911.62s)]
*  And these were a lot of older black families that lived in multi-generational families that lost everything. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1914.62s)]
*  And then when I started doing more research, I realized that this town existed because a lot of these families had moved there in the 1960s and 50s and they were redlined there. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1923.62s)]
*  And they lost not only just their homes, but their community. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1933.62s)]
*  And when you talk to them, we talked to them, you find out that it was just more than it was more than a structure. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1938.62s)]
*  Right. It was it was a thriving everyday community that was no longer there. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1944.62s)]
*  And everybody, no matter what, though, when they lost everything, they were looking out for each other. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1949.62s)]
*  Right. They were not worried about like, how am I going to survive? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1954.62s)]
*  They were like, you know what, we've got to take care of our elderly and we've got to make sure that this community comes back the way that it once was. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1958.62s)]
*  So for me, I wanted to document that I wanted to talk to all the people as much as many as people that I could to talk to them and find out what this community truly means and how we can share this information with the masses. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1964.62s)]
*  I wonder how recovery efforts are going. Like, is it slow because it was a black community? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1977.62s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny you say that because in episode I did a bonus episode. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1982.62s)]
*  So in episode six, I talked to a council member and he says it's funny because when Trump visited California during the wildfires, he went to go see Malibu and he went to go see the Palisades. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1986.62s)]
*  He did not come to Altadena. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1995.62s)]
*  And so, you know, it's like the rhetoric behind Altadena was that it's it's a historic black neighborhood and somehow it was skipped over. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=1997.62s)]
*  It wasn't he didn't come see it. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2004.62s)]
*  But the recovery process is underway, but there's still a lot of like insurance things and insurance companies not covering. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2006.62s)]
*  It's too expensive. People didn't have insurance, laps insurance, insurance that covers certain particular fire. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2015.62s)]
*  And what you have to remember is like I spoke to someone in episode two whose house he paid thirty three thousand dollars for his house. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2021.62s)]
*  His house is worth two point one million dollars now. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2027.62s)]
*  And so when you when you buy your house for that much and it now when you deed the insurance money doesn't cover that much. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2029.62s)]
*  So now you're stuck trying to figure out how to how to pay for that. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2036.62s)]
*  So they only want to give him thirty three thousand. They don't want to give him what the house. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2039.62s)]
*  They want to give him probably about five hundred thousand. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2042.62s)]
*  But the house was worth two point one million dollars. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2044.62s)]
*  So what do you do? You know, but I just you know, in this series, I wanted to humanize this community. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2046.62s)]
*  It was really just a labor of love. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2052.62s)]
*  I wanted the world to understand what this community is going through. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2054.62s)]
*  And I wanted the world to understand that Alta Dena is, you know, it was one of it was California's first black community. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2057.62s)]
*  People think South Central or Baldwin Hills, but it was California's first black middle class neighborhood. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2066.62s)]
*  It's crazy when you see stuff like that, it makes you wonder what the coincidence. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2071.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like when you see them, you know, wipe out a whole community and then, you know, want to build high rises and make it hard for the people who live in that community to come back. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2074.62s)]
*  You just wonder what the coincidence. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2082.62s)]
*  And it's funny you say that to Charlotte, because in episode three, we talk about the disparities of when the alarm systems went out. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2084.62s)]
*  If you West Alta Dena, it was where the black people were redlined to East Alta Dena is where the white people live. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2090.62s)]
*  When you look at the disparities, that neighborhood West Alta Dena, they didn't get the notifications until three thirty in the morning. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2095.62s)]
*  But the East side, they got them at seven thirty p.m. in enough time to prepare. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2101.62s)]
*  I talked to a lady who said at four forty five a.m. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2107.62s)]
*  She was she woke up walking through flames trying to get out of her home. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2109.62s)]
*  She said she only she could only muster up the strength because she didn't want her eighty seven year old father to find her in the home. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2112.62s)]
*  You know, but the alarms, the systems didn't go off. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2119.62s)]
*  And so, you know, there's a there's a lot of there's a lot of investigation that still needs to go on. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2122.62s)]
*  Now, how can you hear more about your podcast and really dive into it? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2126.62s)]
*  Absolutely. You can go to two Alta Dena with love dot com for more information. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2129.62s)]
*  You can download it wherever you get your podcast. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2134.62s)]
*  And please just listen to it. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2136.62s)]
*  I think it is. It is storytelling at its finest. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2138.62s)]
*  It's not in my words. These are the community. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2140.62s)]
*  These are these are their stories. They're telling their stories. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2143.62s)]
*  It's I introduce some, you know, a little bit of educational impact before it. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2146.62s)]
*  But then they come in and they tell you their stories in their own words of what happened. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2151.62s)]
*  So it is, as I say, the art of storytelling. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2155.62s)]
*  It takes you there. It brings you right into that moment. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2159.62s)]
*  What they were feeling, how they remember their community and what what happened that night to them. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2161.62s)]
*  Mimi Brown, give me Instagram and Twitter and all of that. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2166.62s)]

*  It's crazy to me because I always tell people, see this is the first time in a minute we've been together and doing an interview. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2254.62s)]
*  But I always say when I get interviewed, I don't care what none of you all say. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2261.62s)]
*  We didn't know what we was doing. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2265.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2267.62s)]
*  All we were trying to see was who's call time was the next morning. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2269.62s)]
*  We could go out and get something to drink, hang out for the night. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2273.62s)]
*  I was on a continuous from Oz. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2276.62s)]
*  So I knew we had something special. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2279.62s)]
*  I had picked that up. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2281.62s)]
*  Plus, it was the first time like I'm looking at people that's coming up that I was watching. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2283.62s)]
*  They worked the same way they was watching my work. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2287.62s)]
*  When I did Oz, everybody was already kind of famous already. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2289.62s)]
*  But when we got here, that made us and I saw I saw that work coming down. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2292.62s)]
*  The thing with me, nobody don't know the wire was my first job as an actor. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2296.62s)]
*  That was my first time I auditioned for a role, first job. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2301.62s)]
*  So just being around these guys, I'm like, yo, I remember asking JD a whole bunch of questions, bro, what is a trailer? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2305.62s)]
*  What is the hair? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2312.62s)]
*  What are they telling me to do? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2314.62s)]
*  Like rehearsal, I'm like, all right. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2316.62s)]
*  But like I said, man, to be here 23 years later and still just getting to it, everybody healthy, living and breathing. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2318.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2325.62s)]
*  I mean, it's just it's a blessing of God. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2326.62s)]
*  I'm glad people find it new every day. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2327.62s)]
*  Somebody find the show every day so it don't really gauge out. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2328.62s)]
*  The show is more popular now, something years later than it was when it was on TV. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2331.62s)]
*  None of y'all knew it was going to be a cultural staple. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2335.62s)]
*  I definitely know. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2338.62s)]
*  I feel like it was. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2340.62s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2341.62s)]
*  Don't ever tell me that. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2342.62s)]
*  I ain't know that. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2343.62s)]
*  You from Baltimore, you damn right. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2347.62s)]
*  It's definitely a cultural staple. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2349.62s)]
*  When you're moving around anywhere in the world, they know you. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2351.62s)]
*  You know, I mean, like somebody might just stop and say, man, run them lines real quick. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2354.62s)]
*  They quote your lines. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2359.62s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, you know, it's like the study part of it. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2362.62s)]
*  Like when I first came on set, Trey had said we was right there. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2365.62s)]
*  We was at Triller and we was running lines and just like, what else you been on? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2368.62s)]

*  Right. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2374.62s)]
*  It was like first time out where? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2375.62s)]
*  I say first time on the block. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2376.62s)]
*  So we were shooting in the funeral home in Baltimore, like broad day, like funeral home. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2378.62s)]
*  And we was there. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2382.62s)]
*  A lot of people don't know the 12 hours, 12 hours, hard days. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2383.62s)]
*  Turn around. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2386.62s)]
*  Turn around. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2387.62s)]
*  So we out there, we bussing it and we ran the lines. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2388.62s)]
*  We were out there. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2390.62s)]
*  It was raining. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2391.62s)]
*  We take breakfast or lunch. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2392.62s)]
*  It was just a family and we still a family to this day. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2393.62s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2395.62s)]
*  Now I want to start from the beginning, the wire. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2396.62s)]
*  So when y'all got the call to do the wire, break that down. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2397.62s)]
*  When y'all first read the script and how did y'all know that y'all wanted to do it? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2400.62s)]
*  So they, I initially auditioned for Weebae. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2403.62s)]
*  See, that's the way it is. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2406.62s)]
*  I initially auditioned for Weebae's character. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2407.62s)]
*  And I remember going in there with Pat Moran out there in Baltimore and she like, yo, quote this monologue. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2410.62s)]
*  So two weeks later, I get a call. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2415.62s)]
*  She said, we got some bad and good news. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2417.62s)]
*  She said, the bad news is you didn't get the characters Weebae, but you was cast for the character Poop. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2420.62s)]
*  And I was only supposed to be in the first two episodes in the first season. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2425.62s)]
*  And then, spoiler alert, you end up getting Poop all five seasons. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2429.62s)]
*  Last man standing. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2434.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2435.62s)]
*  So I was just happy, you know, getting that script. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2436.62s)]
*  And throughout the years, throughout the seasons, it never said I was getting killed. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2438.62s)]
*  Because that's the thing with the wire. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2441.62s)]
*  You never knew. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2444.62s)]
*  You never knew it was getting off. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2445.62s)]
*  They didn't tell you before. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2446.62s)]
*  They would just, you get the script and you read. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2447.62s)]
*  That's like when Snoop shot at me, you know what I'm saying? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2450.62s)]
*  They like, Poop falls to the ground. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2452.62s)]
*  He's bleeding. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2453.62s)]
*  I'm like, okay, this is it. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2454.62s)]
*  And then I woke up. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2456.62s)]
*  Take this into consideration, Trey, how you just said that. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2457.62s)]
*  I don't know if y'all remember it or not. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2460.62s)]
*  The wire almost ain't even take off. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2462.62s)]
*  Because we auditioned before 9-11. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2464.62s)]
*  9-11 might happen. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2468.62s)]
*  That shit was shut down for three weeks. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2470.62s)]
*  But the thing is, the callbacks was after they opened the city back up. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2472.62s)]
*  Alexa Fogle office started throwing us back. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2476.62s)]
*  I forgot all about this. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2479.62s)]
*  I ain't think nothing. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2481.62s)]
*  So when I went in, I auditioned for D'Angelo. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2482.62s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2485.62s)]
*  Shout out to Larry Zillard, man. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2486.62s)]
*  That's our brother. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2487.62s)]
*  See, down there, it was open because Baltimore was open. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2488.62s)]
*  We was turned up. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2491.62s)]
*  So actually, when I auditioned, I auditioned for Marlo Stanfield. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2492.62s)]
*  You auditioned for Marlo. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2496.62s)]
*  I auditioned for Marlo. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2498.62s)]
*  And then when I got the call, they called me back. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2500.62s)]
*  I was actually coming back from Houston with Steve Francis. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2502.62s)]
*  And I got the call. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2505.62s)]
*  Pep was like, hey, baby, you out. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2506.62s)]
*  I got good news. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2508.62s)]
*  I got good news. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2511.62s)]
*  And she was like, you just landed Slim Charles on HBO. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2512.62s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2515.62s)]
*  Non-character one, Slim Charles. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2516.62s)]
*  She told me I was going to be Bodie. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2519.62s)]
*  Like I said, I wanted to audition for D'Angelo because I was like, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2522.62s)]
*  I just came from playing a tough guy for all these years. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2526.62s)]
*  Y'all going to make me worse than I was already? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2529.62s)]
*  And then she was like, no, this your part. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2531.62s)]
*  Read this part. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2533.62s)]
*  Just go and do your job. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2534.62s)]
*  I went in, came out, and they built on the character so much [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2535.62s)]
*  that I didn't know where it was going to go. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2538.62s)]
*  But I'm glad it was going to go. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2540.62s)]
*  Because in my audition, I think David Simon, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2541.62s)]
*  leaned over the clock and said, he leaned over the clock and said, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2545.62s)]
*  Weebae. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2548.62s)]
*  And I was so hot because I was tearing my up. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2549.62s)]
*  I was in the zone. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2552.62s)]
*  I caught my shot. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2553.62s)]
*  Like, yo, hold on. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2554.62s)]
*  Relax. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2555.62s)]
*  But you know, when you in the room, that's your moment. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2556.62s)]
*  You can go off in there. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2558.62s)]
*  You can go off as long as it's taken or so. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2560.62s)]
*  They threw me off, but I caught it. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2563.62s)]
*  But that's what they were saying. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2565.62s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2566.62s)]
*  You're this guy. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2567.62s)]
*  You're this guy. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2568.62s)]
*  You're this guy. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2569.62s)]
*  You're this guy. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2570.62s)]
*  You're this guy. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2571.62s)]
*  You're this guy. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2572.62s)]
*  You're that guy. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2573.62s)]
*  You're this guy. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2574.62s)]
*  You're that guy. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2575.62s)]
*  But you got to get in character though. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2576.62s)]
*  Because that was my first audition. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2578.62s)]
*  So when I read for Marlo, they was like, come in. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2580.62s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2583.62s)]
*  You don't care about nothing, hoodie. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2584.62s)]
*  So I threw my hoodie on. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2586.62s)]
*  I went in there and read for it. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2587.62s)]
*  And I was like, yo, it was like, what's your name? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2588.62s)]
*  I said Marlo. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2590.62s)]
*  She said, what's your name? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2591.62s)]
*  I said Marlo. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2592.62s)]
*  She said, I said, what the ****? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2593.62s)]
*  Don't you understand? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2594.62s)]
*  That's how you know this is different. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2595.62s)]
*  My name is Marlo. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2596.62s)]
*  That's how you know this is different roots. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2597.62s)]
*  I'm like, we ain't messing with you ever like that. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2598.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2600.62s)]
*  How much of the script was improv though? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2601.62s)]
*  How much of y'all improv? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2603.62s)]
*  Did y'all go off script? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2604.62s)]
*  Because none of it seemed like… [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2605.62s)]
*  Not a lot. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2606.62s)]
*  See, I don't know. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2607.62s)]
*  We didn't have to improv. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2608.62s)]
*  That's how ill it was. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2609.62s)]
*  It was all on the paper. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2610.62s)]
*  Dave would let me get away. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2611.62s)]
*  He would let me get away with a lot of stuff. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2612.62s)]
*  But I would test it out first. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2613.62s)]
*  Like I would use it on one take. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2614.62s)]
*  And then if they don't like it, they just say don't do that. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2615.62s)]
*  But then most of the time they say, say that again. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2616.62s)]
*  Or do that. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2617.62s)]
*  A lot of times I used to like it. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2618.62s)]
*  And that was because also with the dynamic that my group, my crew, they had, they had [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2619.62s)]
*  a lot of people that they were like, I'm going to do this. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2620.62s)]
*  But most of the time, like you said, especially because we had to figure out that Be More [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2621.62s)]
*  I'm saying so it's kind of hard for New Yorkers to get the action. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2647.82s)]
*  But see, I'm from DC. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2662.46s)]
*  So it's like the Chew, the Doug. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2663.46s)]
*  You know, you can't get into it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2664.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2665.46s)]
*  But Baltimore will pull your neck out if they know you faking it. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2666.46s)]
*  You can't drag it too long with it. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2677.06s)]
*  You just got to do it. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2678.06s)]
*  Like, see, like even with New York, like when I did The Deuce, I had to learn dialogue. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2679.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2684.06s)]
*  We shot that. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2685.06s)]
*  We shot that in Brooklyn. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2686.06s)]
*  Then we went to Silver Cup in Queens. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2687.06s)]
*  So I shot that whole show. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2690.06s)]
*  We was back there. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2692.06s)]
*  We did it. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2693.06s)]

*  It was like the pizza that Cole delivered to the door. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2787.06s)]
*  And Beemore jumped up on the table, knocked the pizza down. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2789.06s)]
*  Everybody broke. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2793.06s)]

*  because I got scared to death. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2820.06s)]
*  I said, oh, I'm trying to see it in the episode. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2822.06s)]
*  The joke's like this in Beemore. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2824.06s)]
*  It's like dogs. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2826.06s)]

*  They ain't no ****. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2829.06s)]
*  Did y'all recognize the greatness in Idris back then? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2831.06s)]
*  Did y'all see where it could go or was something like that? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2835.06s)]
*  Yeah, because Idris was funny. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2838.06s)]
*  I met him. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2840.06s)]
*  Idris talking regular with a regular accent this whole time. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2841.06s)]
*  And got on the phone with his daughter, mother. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2845.06s)]
*  Man. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2848.06s)]
*  And I stopped. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2849.06s)]
*  We walking down the block. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2850.06s)]
*  He just started talking that chat and started that blundering. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2851.06s)]
*  And I stopped. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2855.06s)]
*  You like that. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2856.06s)]
*  We kept walking. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2857.06s)]
*  And he finally looked back like, what? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2858.06s)]
*  I was like, where you from? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2860.06s)]
*  You over here acting like you from the Bronx or something? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2862.06s)]
*  He was practicing on us. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2866.06s)]
*  So I knew it right there. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2869.06s)]
*  Like he wanted to warn us. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2870.06s)]
*  One thing, it was a scene where we did, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2872.06s)]
*  we made him sit in the car at the scene where a character does this with my waist. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2873.06s)]
*  And we were sitting in that car for a couple of hours. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2877.06s)]
*  And we was just talking. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2879.06s)]
*  And I remember us getting to the point, I was like, yo, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2880.06s)]
*  because he wanted to have this magazine in the car that I ain't going to get too deep about it. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2882.06s)]
*  They told him not to have it because of who was on it. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2886.06s)]
*  So he was like, I'm going after this. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2889.06s)]
*  Anyway, anyway, we're going to leave that alone. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2892.06s)]
*  So anyway, we in the car. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2893.06s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, when you leave here, you're going to be that guy. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2895.06s)]
*  He's like, well, I think a couple of us are going to do it. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2899.06s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, but like you kind of like right under Denzel looking like you're about to go to him. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2901.06s)]
*  And he said, you see, but it was crazy because when it was time for his character to, you know, to happen, he didn't want that. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2906.06s)]
*  He didn't want that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2913.06s)]
*  He was mad as hell. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2914.06s)]
*  Because we was filming, we filmed that whole morning. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2916.06s)]
*  We filmed that whole morning. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2919.06s)]
*  He came in the truck. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2921.06s)]
*  They was like, it was like a cloud. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2922.06s)]
*  It was like a cloud on the whole set. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2925.06s)]
*  Come out the truck. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2927.06s)]
*  Oh, the string that got killed off. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2928.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2929.06s)]
*  So we had no idea. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2930.06s)]
*  He just found out that morning. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2931.06s)]
*  It was pissed. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2932.06s)]
*  Remember, we never found out until you got the script. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2933.06s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2935.06s)]
*  That's so giant. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2936.06s)]
*  This was the one, y'all. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2937.06s)]
*  At the end, because look, we used to film, they do the tandems now. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2938.06s)]
*  So they do these blocks where you can shoot two or three episodes in a week. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2941.06s)]
*  We really shot the two week episode. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2945.06s)]
*  So we started on a Monday and we wrapped the next week Thursday. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2948.06s)]
*  And then it was a rehearsal Friday and back at it on Monday. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2952.06s)]
*  13 times. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2956.06s)]
*  13 times. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2957.06s)]
*  If they're going to change something, they change it within that. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2958.06s)]
*  So the thing is, look, when we wrapped on an episode, your new script's in your trailer. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2961.06s)]
*  Your new script right in your trailer. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2966.06s)]
*  It's right there already. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2968.06s)]
*  So look, everybody started catching on to doing this. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2969.06s)]
*  Yep. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=2971.06s)]

*  scenes with him, but I used to kick it with his mother. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3061.06s)]

*  for him. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3077.06s)]
*  And what he was doing, like the way me and him, like he used to come out with me all the [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3078.06s)]
*  time. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3082.06s)]
*  She used to let him come out with me. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3083.06s)]
*  I took him to Vegas. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3084.06s)]
*  We went to Magic. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3085.06s)]
*  You know, all the little places Miami. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3086.06s)]
*  Because he was one of the younger ones, right? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3087.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3088.06s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3090.06s)]
*  And so we was always around, but we all got together and he came up with the right mindset. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3091.06s)]
*  And so he was like set up pretty good from going off. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3095.06s)]
*  Yeah, he was. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3097.06s)]

*  When we did the scene we took him out. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3099.06s)]
*  We all had to kill him. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3100.06s)]
*  He thought he was going to never work again. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3101.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3102.06s)]

*  He said that to Brian. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3104.06s)]
*  Bro, I was set. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3105.06s)]

*  Yeah, he just said that. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3108.06s)]
*  The ability that he felt at that time to be the man right now is crazy, right? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3109.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3114.06s)]
*  Because he was messed up behind that. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3115.06s)]
*  He was only on one season, right? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3116.06s)]

*  When he got on drugs and everything. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3119.06s)]
*  And I think we smoked him in episode 12, right? [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3120.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3123.06s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3129.06s)]
*  The body was mad. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3130.06s)]

*  I would have to be sensitive to death. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3142.9s)]
*  Nah, because it wasn't in HD, but literally speaking, raw. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3144.7s)]
*  But yeah, that too. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3149.9s)]
*  Another city maybe, not the Wyatt, not Baltimore again. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3151.48s)]
*  I think it would have to be a whole other city. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3153.98s)]
*  I don't even think they let them be like they was. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3156.02s)]

*  Went to visit him in jail. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3211.6200000000003s)]
*  But it was crazy because the whole pod was when Prop Joe, when Meth, when he did that [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3212.94s)]
*  not kill Meth, killed Cheese, everything was flipping around because we had the co-op. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3218.06s)]

*  Brick City. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3243.62s)]
*  We're still kicking it with the cast of The Wire. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3244.62s)]
*  Now I gotta ask about this meme right here, we bait. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3245.62s)]
*  Did you hate this meme? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3248.62s)]
*  I love it. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3249.62s)]
*  Did you hate this meme? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3250.62s)]
*  I used to hate it. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3251.62s)]
*  I did. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3252.62s)]
*  I did use to hate it, right? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3253.62s)]
*  Because nobody understood it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3255.62s)]
*  Nobody understood it. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3257.62s)]
*  But then it started catching on, especially with the younger kids. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3258.62s)]
*  I was like, hold on, I gotta get my uncle on with the shorty. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3261.62s)]
*  I gotta explain, I gotta educate them to wear that. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3264.62s)]
*  They'll be like, that's you from the meme, but they don't know where it's from. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3268.62s)]
*  I'll be like, this is the dopest show in the world. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3271.62s)]
*  Not because I was on it, but because it's dope. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3274.62s)]
*  They go check it out. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3277.62s)]
*  It made it timeless. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3279.62s)]
*  The meme just made everything timeless. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3281.62s)]
*  It don't get old. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3283.62s)]
*  It don't get old. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3284.62s)]
*  They don't. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3285.62s)]
*  They don't. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3286.62s)]
*  I can't front. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3287.62s)]
*  I wanted to ask y'all since y'all mentioned them. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3288.62s)]
*  How did the loss of Michael K. Williams impact you? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3289.62s)]
*  Man, it was tough. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3292.62s)]
*  I was mad. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3293.62s)]
*  It crushed so bad. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3294.62s)]
*  It was so tough, man. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3295.62s)]
*  Remember when I was on the balcony in LA? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3296.62s)]
*  We was on the phone, FaceTime, talking to JD, Trey, Mike. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3298.62s)]
*  I had just talked to Mike two days before that because he was like, some people was looking for me for a role. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3304.62s)]
*  He was like, bro, we down here. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3309.62s)]
*  You gotta get down here. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3311.62s)]
*  Get out of that city. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3312.62s)]
*  Come down. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3313.62s)]
*  I was like, wow. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3314.62s)]
*  Then he called me about another piece that they was trying to get me to work on with my band. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3315.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3319.62s)]
*  Back yard DC. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3320.62s)]
*  After that, I talked to Trey and we was talking. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3321.62s)]
*  Then I had just talked to him and Snoop, then it hit. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3324.62s)]
*  But that don't crush me. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3327.62s)]
*  It crushed me, man. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3328.62s)]
*  Because that was big, bro. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3329.62s)]
*  They slined Mike. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3330.62s)]
*  I always say, though, Michael K. Williams, he wasn't an industry person. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3331.62s)]
*  He was more so like, bro, how's your mom, dad, your wife, your kids? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3337.62s)]
*  He was that with Mike. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3342.62s)]
*  See, Mike was trying to say it, bro. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3343.62s)]
*  Talking to him weeks before that he passed, it was just like, what? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3345.62s)]
*  I hit his car. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3350.62s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying, Charlamagne? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3351.62s)]
*  Why you say they slimed him? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3353.62s)]
*  What you mean? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3354.62s)]
*  Well, like the people that served him. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3355.62s)]
*  Oh, got you. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3357.62s)]
*  They slimed him because they knew what they was doing. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3358.62s)]
*  They knew who Mike was. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3362.62s)]
*  And it was all out of bounds. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3363.62s)]
*  And anybody with a heart, that's why when they did catch up, caught up with him, I didn't feel bad at all. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3365.62s)]
*  Throw him under the jail. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3370.62s)]
*  I feel you, bro. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3371.62s)]
*  I know hustlers gotta feed their family, but y'all slimed my bro. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3372.62s)]
*  I want to ask y'all, how hard was it to break out of your wired characters when it came time to audition for other roles? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3375.62s)]
*  Man, I'm gonna tell y'all, man, the wire ended in 2008. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3379.62s)]
*  I didn't work again what they would consider mainstream into 2015 when I booked Saints and Sinners, which was a six season show, a job. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3383.62s)]
*  But being, you know, what they call a typecast or whatever. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3394.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3397.62s)]
*  I'm going in the rooms with the casting directors, with the directors, producers. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3398.62s)]
*  But with me not like booking certain jobs or whatever, I just started creating my own. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3402.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3407.62s)]
*  So when I started Chaney Vision Entertainment, my company, I'm partnering up with Cast Like Food with the Kermit. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3408.62s)]
*  Shout out to my brother. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3413.62s)]
*  I'm producing my own films in lies, love and larceny. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3414.62s)]
*  I'm partnering up with people like Anthony Clark, Dana Freeman. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3418.62s)]
*  And we just doing a whole bunch of like my own independent projects, which is really, you know, what got me to the place of booking what they consider mainstream. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3420.62s)]
*  We own this city, BNF. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3430.62s)]
*  Because I stood on the streets of Washington, D.C. from 2010 to 2015, selling all of my independent films out the trunk of my car. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3431.62s)]
*  That was something that most celebrities wouldn't dare do. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3439.62s)]
*  You know, so it's people walking up like, man, you pulled from the wire. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3441.62s)]
*  What you doing out here? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3444.62s)]
*  I'm like, bro, the wire was the wire. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3445.62s)]
*  And I learned and I learned a lot. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3448.62s)]
*  But if we go and sit up here and consider myself a working actor. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3450.62s)]
*  Yeah, I'm out here. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3454.62s)]
*  I'm out here taking it back to the street. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3455.62s)]
*  I'm pumping my own website, Chaneyway.com. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3457.62s)]
*  And then that led to my man, George Pierre, who was casting for Saints and Sinners. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3459.62s)]
*  Shout out to you. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3464.62s)]
*  Yeah, shout out to George Pierre, man. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3465.62s)]
*  That's my guy. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3466.62s)]
*  Cast me for Saints and Sinners, the Kishico biopic, BNF. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3467.62s)]
*  Like that's our brother out there in Atlanta. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3469.62s)]
*  But he called me one day like, yo, I heard what you're doing in the streets, man. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3471.62s)]
*  Like you pumping your own merch and your own movies out the trunk of your car. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3475.62s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, man, I mean, but this is the way that I'm getting in. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3478.62s)]
*  And I was like creating, like really developing my fan base. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3481.62s)]
*  Because people seeing like a celebrity out on the street just getting to it, you know, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3485.62s)]
*  it just helped me in so many ways. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3490.62s)]
*  And now, Envy, it's a road that I need to manifest. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3492.62s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3495.62s)]
*  Thirteen years in the projects, my mentality is what, kid? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3496.62s)]
*  You talk a good one, but you don't want it. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3499.62s)]
*  Oh, you been saying that forever. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3501.62s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3502.62s)]
*  You been saying you want to play Havoc for it. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3503.62s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder what he want. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3505.62s)]
*  That's his big. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3506.62s)]
*  But it wasn't what you and JD were going to do with Havoc in projects. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3507.62s)]
*  Well, no, Havoc gave me his blessing. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3510.62s)]
*  Me and Havoc have been talking for two and a half years. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3512.62s)]
*  And you know, the press is running with the TMZ and Burl and Stone. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3514.62s)]
*  And right now, bro, like we've been talking. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3518.62s)]
*  And my thing is this, like just studying everything. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3523.62s)]
*  Like, because the project would have to be about what made them speak like this. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3528.62s)]
*  Even if we all got an idea of why they recorded these records or why they were speaking like that, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3532.62s)]
*  it got to, it has to be the backstory, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3538.62s)]
*  the mindset of why these 19 year old brothers were doing this. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3540.62s)]
*  Have you read Prodigy, My Infamous Life? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3544.62s)]
*  No, I'm grabbing. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3546.62s)]
*  That should be a movie. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3547.62s)]
*  I got a chance to have lunch and dinner with Prodigy a couple of times. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3548.62s)]
*  And I was in a whole bunch of Prodigy videos. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3552.62s)]
*  I know how Prodigy is and I got a chance to kick it with him. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3555.62s)]
*  He was a good dude, real good dude. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3558.62s)]
*  I peed a lot. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3559.62s)]
*  I definitely got a lot of respect for that. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3560.62s)]
*  If that comes around, that comes around. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3562.62s)]
*  That's what I want to tell you. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3563.62s)]
*  And like I say, man, I'm well prepared. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3564.62s)]
*  But I'm going to bring this into fruition, man. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3565.62s)]
*  That's why you got to read My Infamous Life. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3567.62s)]
*  No, that will tell you all that. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3569.62s)]
*  We brought it to the right now. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3571.62s)]
*  You got to get it. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3573.62s)]
*  That's the move. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3574.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3575.62s)]
*  That's the move. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3576.62s)]
*  The more Prodigy, the more Prodigy. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3577.62s)]

*  Of course. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3582.62s)]
*  My last question, what do people still misunderstand about The Wire even after all these years? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3583.62s)]
*  Best television show ever. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3588.62s)]
*  No, that is not a black show. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3589.62s)]
*  That's what I feel like. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3592.62s)]
*  That's real. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3593.62s)]
*  That's what I think people, it's an American show. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3594.62s)]
*  It's about America. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3597.62s)]
*  It just so happened we tell them the stories of mostly black people. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3598.62s)]
*  But it got layers. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3603.62s)]
*  It's about how the street affects the police. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3604.62s)]
*  The police affect the politicians. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3606.62s)]
*  The politicians affect the street. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3608.62s)]
*  Education. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3609.62s)]
*  So that's what it's about. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3610.62s)]

*  The doctors coming in. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3612.62s)]
*  That show taught you everything. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3613.62s)]
*  The Wire taught you everything about what you need to know about life. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3616.62s)]
*  And also you ain't your brain, right? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3620.62s)]

*  Well, it's the latest. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3841.02s)]
*  The Breakfast Club. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3842.02s)]
*  Talk to me! [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3843.02s)]
*  Alright, so... [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3844.02s)]
*  Fill us in, fill us in, fill us in. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3845.02s)]
*  A big part yesterday was them going through text messages, the defense attorneys, because [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3846.02s)]
*  they were, right now, they are fighting to prove that Cassie was a willing participant [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3851.02s)]
*  in the freak offs, that there was no force, there was no coercion. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3857.02s)]
*  So they going through these text messages, basically it was a ton of them. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3859.02s)]
*  And she's in the text messages saying she's down for the freak offs. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3863.02s)]
*  Also, she's in these text messages planning, like you know how she said Puff was the ultimate [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3867.02s)]
*  choreographer of these things? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3871.02s)]
*  She's giving very much Laurieann Gibson. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3873.02s)]
*  She was choreographing her dang self in these text messages. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3875.02s)]
*  So what they did was, which I thought was like, again, brilliant, and it blew the prosecution's [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3878.02s)]
*  setup up. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3883.02s)]
*  The day that Diddy and Cassie got into that fight at the Intercontinental Hotel, the video [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3884.02s)]
*  that CNN dropped, when the prosecution presented the narrative around it, like, okay, let's [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3889.02s)]
*  give y'all some background info, they only used like three texts from the day of March [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3894.02s)]
*  5th. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3898.02s)]
*  The defense attorneys was like, let's go back to March 3rd, and let's lead you into where [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3899.02s)]
*  the prosecutors, y'all talked about text messages. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3904.02s)]
*  Now it's 2017, right? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3906.02s)]
*  2016. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3908.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3909.02s)]
*  So in the text messages, Cassie and Diddy are having a conversation, days leading in, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3910.02s)]
*  and you know, they're like sexting and a lot of the explicit text messages they wouldn't [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3915.02s)]
*  read in court, so I don't know exactly what she was saying, but they were sexting a bit. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3918.02s)]
*  She sent, I believe it was four or five sexual text messages, like she's initiating that. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3921.02s)]
*  Puff is really going some like, I'm proud of you because she did have that big movie [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3926.02s)]
*  premiere coming up. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3930.02s)]
*  So he's like, I'm proud of you. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3931.02s)]
*  You got this weekend coming up. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3932.02s)]
*  They talking about like accessories for her outfit. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3933.02s)]
*  And then she's like, so it gets to the weekend, right? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3935.02s)]
*  It gets to the day that they did that freak off. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3937.02s)]
*  And she's trying to figure out what her plans are. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3939.02s)]
*  And he's like, okay, well, I'm down to do whatever you want to do. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3941.02s)]
*  Let me know what you got going on. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3943.02s)]
*  So she's like, I want to see my baby. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3944.02s)]
*  And then then they start and now they're having a conversation about the freak off. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3947.02s)]
*  And he's telling her, since you want to do this, you plan it. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3950.02s)]
*  Call the guy from the the male escort service they were using, a Cowboys or something like that. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3954.02s)]
*  And grab, get who you want. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3960.02s)]
*  You set up how how this one is going to go. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3962.02s)]
*  He even sent her a text message is like, if you want, we can sit back and just watch. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3964.02s)]
*  Like, we don't have to even participate. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3968.02s)]
*  And they asked her, they was like, OK, so what does that mean? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3970.02s)]
*  Like, sit back and just watch. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3973.02s)]
*  There were also text messages from another. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3974.02s)]
*  So that created a whole different narrative around it, right? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3976.02s)]
*  But there were also text messages. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3978.02s)]
*  Remember, she talked about being forced to do it on her period and stuff like that. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3980.02s)]
*  There was text messages where she mentioned being on her period and he didn't force her to do anything on her period. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3983.02s)]
*  He kind of like backed off of it. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3989.02s)]
*  He was like, OK, bad. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3991.02s)]
*  Like, cool. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3992.02s)]
*  The text messages that they showed yesterday in court that that whole force, that coercion thing, it blew that up. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3993.02s)]
*  Now, I listen, I'm just being objective here, right? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=3998.02s)]
*  Diddy's legal team has already conceded to some aspects of his conduct. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4001.02s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4006.02s)]
*  So they're just trying to say in regards to Cassie, it wasn't coercion. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4007.02s)]
*  It was consensual. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4011.02s)]
*  Correct. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4012.02s)]
*  Now, those text messages go all the way back to 2009. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4013.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4015.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4016.02s)]
*  They even before that, they had like 2007, I think, in some texts. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4017.02s)]
*  OK, so the ones that are from 2017, all Cassie is going to say is that she said whatever needed to be said because if she didn't comply, he would beat her up or be violent to her. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4019.02s)]
*  She already admitted that she loved him. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4028.02s)]
*  She said she also was afraid of him. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4030.02s)]
*  That's typical in an abusive relationship. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4032.02s)]
*  100%. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4034.02s)]
*  It shows that she was involved and that she wasn't being forced. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4035.02s)]
*  But I think they knew that. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4039.02s)]
*  But what if she was afraid? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4040.02s)]
*  When she texted him to say, next time she texted Sam and they asked. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4041.02s)]
*  When she texted him to ask about it, I think it's going to show that she wanted to do it just as much as he wanted to do it. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4043.02s)]
*  No, but she said she already had contextualized that. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4049.02s)]
*  She contextualized that her first couple of days in court by saying, I did whatever I had to do and said what I had to say in order not to get my freaking face beat. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4052.02s)]
*  But I think, so seeing that, and that's what I'm saying, because like for instance, there was one text from 2009. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4060.02s)]
*  That's the one where she says to correct it. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4065.02s)]
*  That's the moment she directly says, I'm always down to freak off. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4068.02s)]
*  And then later she talks about how she wants it to be like she wants it dirty. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4071.02s)]
*  Like she wants it aggressive. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4074.02s)]
*  She wants it whatever. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4075.02s)]
*  So that you know why they did that because they're trying to show if he was aggressive at all. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4076.02s)]
*  She asked for that. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4079.02s)]
*  But she was down with it. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4080.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4081.02s)]
*  But I just think that like in the text messages leading up to that intercontinental video, he was so gentle in the conversation. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4082.02s)]
*  Like there was no. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4090.02s)]
*  She didn't want another woman in that position. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4091.02s)]
*  She didn't want him with any other woman. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4093.02s)]
*  She wanted to be the only woman. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4095.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4096.02s)]
*  But see, but what the Cassie thing, you know, I don't think it's going to be an explosive as Dawn and James Crews. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4097.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4103.02s)]
*  And the reason I think Dawn Richard, because they both announced yesterday that they're going to be in a witness stand is there was no that we know of relationship. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4104.02s)]
*  So this is straight off of there is no I don't know. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4110.02s)]
*  I find out why Q was crying in that Vlad TV interview. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4113.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4115.02s)]
*  It's the same thing with James Crews. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4116.02s)]
*  James Crews was the manager. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4117.02s)]
*  So the fact that the prosecution is calling James Crews and the fact that the prosecution is going on. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4118.02s)]
*  Cassie said that James Crews and D Rock cried when they saw her get beat up. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4124.02s)]
*  But listen, can it get more explosive than on the nipple? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4128.02s)]
*  Another man. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4130.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4131.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4132.02s)]
*  Even the oil being warmed up. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4133.02s)]
*  Yes, because Dawn Richards was there and she has no love for him. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4135.02s)]
*  So she's not letting anything back. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4138.02s)]
*  I'm sure Cassie's still being a little sensitive, but James Crews and Dawn. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4140.02s)]
*  Those are the expulsions. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4145.02s)]
*  And also, you said something. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4146.02s)]
*  And James Crews was ex-manager. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4147.02s)]
*  You said something about, you know, Diddy was being gentle in text messages. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4149.02s)]
*  That means nothing because we saw the hotel video. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4153.02s)]
*  You can be gentle in a text message, but then in person. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4156.02s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4159.02s)]
*  The only reason I brought that up is because we saw the hotel video. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4160.02s)]
*  But when Cassie talked about the hotel video in court, the way that she framed how the lead up to that was, like even their interaction while she was on stand, it came off as very much like, oh my God, I'm just here. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4162.02s)]
*  I don't want to be here. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4175.02s)]
*  My body is being like used, bruised and like, I like almost like literally like a sex slave almost. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4176.02s)]
*  But then you see the conversation and he's like, we shouldn't do the freak off because you got this big movie premiere. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4181.02s)]
*  We should let's start early so you can get some rest. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4187.02s)]
*  You got to take it. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4190.02s)]
*  Basically, he's trying to look out for her in that situation. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4191.02s)]
*  She wanted to do the freak off right before she went to work. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4194.02s)]
*  Yeah, but he kept saying that he was like, too bad you got work, too bad you got work. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4196.02s)]
*  We should do it early. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4199.02s)]
*  You should get rest. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4200.02s)]
*  But her narrative was completely different. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4201.02s)]
*  Even though we just make you think like, I'm because they also brought in basically what's your motive? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4203.02s)]
*  Is it vengeance? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4209.02s)]
*  Because she they they read another text about Kim Porter. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4210.02s)]
*  Cassie was upset that she never got to spend holidays with Diddy and Kim Porter did. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4214.02s)]
*  And it was apparent that she felt the way about the woman, Gina, which is what broke up their relationship. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4218.02s)]
*  Michael B. Jordan got some strays in here. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4222.02s)]
*  They had a meeting with Kit Cuddy before they blew up a car. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4224.02s)]
*  They allegedly they went to dinner with Kit Cuddy. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4227.02s)]
*  Puff sat them both down and wanted to have a conversation about the relationship. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4230.02s)]
*  They brought that up yesterday because she made it seem like he sat them down because he's big bag puff trying to scare him. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4233.02s)]
*  The fence said, no, he sat down because he introduced you all. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4238.02s)]
*  He felt the way about that. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4241.02s)]
*  He put you in the studio with him and then you start you go grab a burner phone and start dealing with him. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4242.02s)]
*  Of course, he wants to shut down the Kit Cuddy, saying in that meeting. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4245.02s)]
*  Well, why are you burning my car? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4247.02s)]
*  No, he the car thing hadn't happened yet. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4248.02s)]
*  He said, what about my car? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4252.02s)]
*  Because I think Cassie had kind of warned him like he said this is going to happen. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4253.02s)]
*  And Puff was like, I don't know what you're talking about. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4256.02s)]
*  What car? I guarantee you today all the prosecution is going to say they're going to ask Cassie questions and Cassie's going to say she told Diddy whatever she needed to tell him because she was afraid. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4258.02s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4266.02s)]
*  That's I guarantee you. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4267.02s)]
*  100 percent. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4268.02s)]
*  Cassie probably possibly doing. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4269.02s)]
*  G-Money didn't want to be down no more. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4270.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4272.02s)]
*  And when he didn't want to be down no more, he started doing his own thing. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4273.02s)]
*  But my thing is, will she be penalized because she was down at one point? [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4276.02s)]
*  Who's the light skin cute accountant though? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4280.02s)]
*  You. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4282.02s)]
*  The tapes ain't come out yet. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4283.02s)]
*  We got eight more weeks, baby. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4285.02s)]
*  We got eight more weeks. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4286.02s)]
*  You hear me, Lauren? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4288.02s)]
*  Huh? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4289.02s)]
*  My thing is, will she be penalized because she was down at one point? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4290.02s)]
*  That's what Emmy is kind of asking too. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4293.02s)]
*  She was initiating at one point. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4294.02s)]
*  I asked and I was told that there's rumors that there was a conversation about immunity [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4295.02s)]
*  with her, but I'm going to try and get some more confirmed information on that because [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4300.02s)]
*  I keep saying that. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4303.02s)]
*  Like she, yeah, she was complicit at some point. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4304.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4307.02s)]
*  All right. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4308.02s)]

*  How do I dog her out? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4416.02s)]
*  You know what? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4417.02s)]
*  You're a little cool, baby. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4418.02s)]
*  Because every time she do a segment, she can only say half of it. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4419.02s)]
*  Then you interrupt the whole other half, man. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4422.02s)]
*  Now I'm telling you, that's cool, because we'll be into what she's saying. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4424.02s)]
*  And then you keep interrupting her and then you keep messing with her by the way. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4427.02s)]
*  You're a bully, bro. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4430.02s)]
*  First of all, first of all, first of all. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4431.02s)]

*  I appreciate it. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4434.02s)]
*  First of all, I actually complimented on her hair yesterday. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4435.02s)]
*  I told her that her bob looked good. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4438.02s)]
*  But then Envy jumped out the window and was like, nah, you killing it. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4439.02s)]
*  And I was like, don't OD, you wilding. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4442.02s)]
*  She's not killing it. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4443.02s)]
*  She okay. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4444.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4445.02s)]
*  Now, as far as the interruptions, we're having conversations. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4446.02s)]
*  I'll be having questions. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4448.02s)]
*  That's all. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4449.02s)]
*  But you got listeners that want to finish hearing what she's saying. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4450.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4453.02s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4454.02s)]

*  You so worried about my legs, you ain't listening. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4457.02s)]
*  That ain't going to change. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4458.02s)]
*  You so worried about my legs. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4459.02s)]

*  Tammy, who you want to get the biggest E-hall to this morning? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4467.02s)]
*  Actually, I want to give it, it's a blanket. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4468.02s)]
*  I want to give it to my melanated, unhealed women that keep allowing our melanated brothers, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4469.02s)]
*  men, fathers, uncles, sons coming into our homes. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4477.02s)]
*  And you want to treat them like caca. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4482.02s)]
*  Treat them like what? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4484.02s)]
*  Like the world is beating our men up. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4485.02s)]
*  Treat them like caca. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4487.02s)]
*  Oh, got you. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4488.02s)]
*  Got you. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4489.02s)]
*  Like the world is beating our melanated men up. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4490.02s)]
*  Like the world is beating our men up. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4493.02s)]
*  Like the world is beating our melanated men up. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4495.02s)]
*  Like crazy. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4496.02s)]
*  I'm so tired of hearing them speak their silent tears. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4497.02s)]
*  Because what I do as a profession, I speak to melanated men daily. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4500.02s)]
*  And their homes of their melanated women that's in their life is not a safe space. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4505.02s)]
*  So women, get it together if you are melanated. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4511.02s)]
*  This world is already beating them down. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4513.02s)]
*  Cut it out. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4515.02s)]
*  So it's a blanket for all of y'all that are unhealed and keep bleeding on men that didn't [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4516.02s)]
*  cut you. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4520.02s)]
*  I agree with that wholeheartedly. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4521.02s)]
*  And I think it goes both ways. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4522.02s)]
*  I think everybody needs to be doing the work on each other so we stop projecting our pain [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4523.02s)]
*  on other people. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4527.02s)]

*  I was born in Houston. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4818.02s)]
*  Wow. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4819.02s)]
*  But my family was a big rock. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4820.02s)]
*  They were both big Rockets fans. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4821.02s)]
*  And yeah, just one thing led to another. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4822.02s)]
*  First name is, well, last name is not first name. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4825.02s)]
*  Got you. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4827.02s)]
*  So his name led to Olajuwon. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4828.02s)]
*  That was. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4829.02s)]
*  That was. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4830.02s)]
*  My father, he was born in South Memphis and he changed his name during the Black Panthers [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4831.02s)]
*  when he was about 24. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4835.580000000001s)]
*  Changed his name from Robert Rutledge to Kwame Ajanaku and now I'm Olajuwon Ajanaku. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4838.02s)]
*  Yeah, they wanted a slave master name. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4842.02s)]
*  What's your ancestry? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4844.02s)]
*  Yeah, 40% Nigerian. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4846.02s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4848.02s)]
*  But it's a Ghanaian name, Garibah. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4849.02s)]
*  But it's a split in between the two. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4853.02s)]
*  They were just big Houston Rockets fans. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4855.02s)]
*  Dope. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4857.02s)]
*  Dope. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4858.02s)]
*  And then when I first met Earl, I didn't realize that I'd never met a young Earl before. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4859.02s)]
*  Earl? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4863.02s)]
*  Earl? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4864.02s)]
*  All I know is Earl. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4865.02s)]
*  Oh, the old Earl. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4866.02s)]
*  Is his name Earl for real? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4867.02s)]
*  That's a name you gotta grow into. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4868.02s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4870.02s)]
*  You ain't grown to it yet. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4871.02s)]
*  You still look too young for Earl. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4872.02s)]
*  Sorry, I got a son on the way. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4874.02s)]
*  He gonna be Earl too. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4876.02s)]
*  Oh, what the hell? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4877.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4878.02s)]
*  Earl needs another Earl. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4879.02s)]
*  I mean, DMX made it a classic name. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4880.02s)]
*  Earl Simmons, of course. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4882.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4883.02s)]
*  You're right about that. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4884.02s)]
*  So how did you guys get into golf? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4885.02s)]
*  What made you say golf is a sport that I want to do, I want to try, I love? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4887.02s)]
*  And talk about that, your passion for golf. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4891.02s)]
*  Yeah, a friend of the family introduced me to the game. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4893.02s)]
*  I grew up with his sons playing golf. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4895.02s)]
*  We all ended up getting golf scholarships to college. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4897.02s)]
*  But the thing was we ended up playing basketball and golf growing up. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4900.02s)]
*  So we were really competitive. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4904.02s)]
*  And it was just on the east side of Atlanta. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4905.02s)]
*  I mean, it was a way to stay out of the streets, for real, like off Bouldercrest Road, you know, east side. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4907.02s)]
*  It was tough, but right when I leave, because right when I leave the golf course, I mean, the hood is right there. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4912.02s)]
*  But when I met the golf course, like, it was positive influences, always, at the golf course. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4917.02s)]
*  I didn't really have that as much at home, but why not go to the golf course and actually get that? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4922.02s)]
*  So judges, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, these are the people that I'm looking up to. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4928.02s)]
*  Like, how are these people at 11 a.m. on a Tuesday just out and about doing their own thing and now it was golf? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4933.02s)]
*  So I just wanted to be a part of that and have that to be a part of my life. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4940.02s)]
*  So that's what really just pushed me to it. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4944.02s)]
*  Yeah. And you're from Delaware. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4946.02s)]
*  Yeah, I'm from Delaware. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4947.02s)]
*  Really? I didn't know people really was from there. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4948.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4951.02s)]
*  That's how I met Lauren. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4952.02s)]
*  I told you he was going to do that. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4953.02s)]
*  There's only two of us. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4955.02s)]
*  Two black people. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4957.02s)]
*  Two black people. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4961.02s)]
*  But you play golf too, right? [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4962.02s)]
*  Yeah, I started playing golf at the age of six, Inner City Youth Golf Program. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4964.02s)]
*  It was called the LPGA Urban Youth Golf Program. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4968.02s)]
*  And my parents just signed me up, like nobody in my family played. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4971.02s)]
*  And I often like to say I'm happy that my dad didn't listen to a six-year-old because left up to me, I was like, I don't want to do this. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4974.02s)]
*  You know, where are all my friends? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4980.02s)]
*  Everybody looked like me. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4981.02s)]
*  But he kept me in it. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4983.02s)]
*  And then at 13, I ended up winning the golf channel drive Chip and Putt, which is like a free trip to Disney World. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4984.02s)]
*  I was on TV and I'm like, man, if every golf tournament like this, I'm ready to practice. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4989.02s)]
*  You know, I was fortunate enough. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4993.02s)]
*  Elijah Juan and I, you know, had a golf scholarship at the Morales College and played on the golf team there. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4994.02s)]
*  And that's where we met. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=4999.02s)]
*  Break that down for you. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5000.02s)]
*  You said it was called the Inner City? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5001.02s)]
*  It was called the LPGA, which is Ladies Professional Golf Association. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5002.02s)]
*  So they had a ladies major event in Wilmington called the McDonald Championship, and they created like a nonprofit off of that. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5007.02s)]
*  And it was that urban youth golf program. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5013.02s)]
*  So again, just trying to get young kids involved in the game. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5016.02s)]
*  And then for us, I'll say that's what also kind of helped shape our point of view. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5020.02s)]
*  Like, because everyone's like, well, how did y'all get here? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5027.02s)]
*  And these programs are great, but you need an evolved adult. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5029.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5032.02s)]
*  Like all of you all have kids, so you're not just going to drop, call it a 10 year old off at a golf course. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5033.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5038.02s)]
*  The average age is a 50 year old white man. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5039.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5041.02s)]
*  And then you come back, like, what happened? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5042.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5043.02s)]
*  So it takes an evolved adult. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5044.02s)]
*  And that's one of the things that we're always constantly encouraging people like, go with the kid. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5045.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5049.02s)]
*  Whatever that may be. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5050.02s)]
*  So a lot of our focus has been on young professionals, not necessarily just the kids, because we don't even make kids clothes just yet. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5051.02s)]
*  I wonder how much Tiger Woods made people feel like. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5057.02s)]
*  Influence people? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5060.02s)]
*  How much influence people that touch, reach out to young black kids and try to get them involved and go. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5061.02s)]
*  I mean, he was, yeah, everything for us. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5065.02s)]
*  Like coming up Tiger Woods was, you know, he dominated it. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5067.02s)]
*  He made us want to watch it. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5070.02s)]
*  You know, you want to be just like Tiger. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5072.02s)]
*  I mean, the catalyst for me when I was 13, actually I was playing golf at, it's across from East Lake Country Club in Atlanta where they hold the Tour Championship. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5074.02s)]
*  Y'all definitely got to come out for that. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5083.02s)]
*  But across from there, Charlie Yates Junior Academy in 2001 actually got sponsored by Nike to go up to Chicago. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5085.02s)]
*  I got a 30 minute lesson from Tiger Woods and Earl Woods at the time when his father was still here. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5093.02s)]
*  So, I mean, ever since then, I've just been on it. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5098.02s)]
*  You know, I've been hungry for the game. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5101.02s)]
*  I mean, everything that it entitles as far as like gives you, you know, and just the people that it surrounds you, that surrounds you because you play it. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5103.02s)]
*  So, yeah, it's no wonders for me. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5111.02s)]
*  But what made y'all want to stick with it though, right? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5113.02s)]
*  Because I know you said if you were six, you wouldn't want to do it. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5115.02s)]
*  It's porn. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5118.02s)]
*  That's the first thing that, you know, people argue and they say about it. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5119.02s)]
*  What made y'all want to stick with it? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5122.02s)]
*  Y'all actually have a golfing brand like what people are buying. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5124.02s)]
*  Y'all got stores about to open up and airports and everything. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5128.02s)]
*  Y'all still about to have y'all peril in what Nordstrom or something like that. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5132.02s)]
*  Yeah, we're in Nordstrom right now. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5136.02s)]
*  Yeah, we're here in New York on 57. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5137.02s)]
*  What made y'all want to stick with that? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5139.02s)]
*  You don't really see a lot of us in golf, right? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5141.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5144.02s)]
*  So honestly for me, golf changed my life. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5145.02s)]
*  I mean, as far as temperament, resilience, you know, I mean, everything that I am as far as like just hard work and structure. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5147.02s)]
*  I mean, because when you look at golf in every shot that you take in golf, it's individual. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5157.02s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5161.02s)]
*  You can't look at the entire thing as you get lost. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5162.02s)]
*  But that's just like life. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5165.02s)]
*  You got to take it one step at a time, a day at a time, you know? [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5166.02s)]
*  And golf just taught me to be really intricate on each single detail. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5169.02s)]
*  And that's a little just relate that over to my professional career as far as corporate finance when I was in that about to become VP of sales over to here running a business. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5173.02s)]
*  You know, there's steps to it and you have to build systems to be successful. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5183.02s)]
*  And it's crazy. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5187.02s)]
*  I use all of those things from golf to relay it onto my business in it. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5188.02s)]
*  And it's been working. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5192.02s)]
*  When do you take the step to be professional as far as a golfer? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5193.02s)]
*  Right. You know, you see all these people. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5197.02s)]
*  Everybody's into golf. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5198.02s)]
*  And when is it professional? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5199.02s)]
*  And break it down a little bit like we all know basketball. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5201.02s)]
*  We know there's a draft. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5203.02s)]
*  We all know football. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5204.02s)]
*  We know there's a draft. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5205.02s)]
*  We know baseball. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5206.02s)]
*  You go into the D League or the farm league, as they call it. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5207.02s)]
*  So how does golf work when it comes to that? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5211.02s)]
*  Because you were a professional time. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5212.02s)]
*  So I'm a PGA professional. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5214.02s)]
*  So PGA professionals are the men and women. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5216.02s)]
*  And we're experts in the golf business. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5219.02s)]
*  So at every golf course, there is a person that managed that. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5221.02s)]
*  And so more that's what I did. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5225.02s)]
*  So you get your PGA certification. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5227.02s)]
*  It's 28,000 PGA members across the country. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5229.02s)]
*  Out of that 28,000, there's roughly like 300 African-Americans. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5233.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5237.02s)]
*  So the number is, you know, that's less than half of 1%. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5238.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5241.02s)]
*  So there's definitely a lot of work to be done there. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5242.02s)]
*  But that's what I'm considered a PGA professional versus Elijah Juan. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5244.02s)]
*  You want to explain? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5249.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5250.02s)]
*  I mean, the reason that I started this brand was, I mean, [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5251.02s)]
*  back when I, after I graduated from Morehouse, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5254.02s)]
*  major was accounting, monitoring, finance. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5256.02s)]
*  I turned pro in golf. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5258.02s)]
*  I did that for a couple of years, won a couple of mini tour events, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5260.02s)]
*  but got to a point I just couldn't afford it anymore. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5262.02s)]
*  You know, taking up odd jobs, cardboard, caddying, like hustling. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5265.02s)]
*  However I can get it to fund my golf career. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5268.02s)]
*  Last time me and my mom got in an argument, she was like, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5271.02s)]
*  you know, it's about that time you get a job. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5273.02s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5275.02s)]
*  And so I had to stop that. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5276.02s)]
*  And I started my finance career. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5278.02s)]
*  I was in commercial finance for about 10 years. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5280.02s)]
*  But it got to a point, like I said, I wanted to play professional golf, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5283.02s)]
*  but I knew it would be hard to find sponsors. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5287.02s)]
*  So to your point, the only way to turn pro is to have sponsors in the game. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5289.02s)]
*  You got to be good enough where sponsors find you pretty much. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5293.02s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5296.02s)]
*  And it's full circle for me, actually. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5297.02s)]
*  I'm turning back pro in golf in June. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5299.02s)]
*  That's the reason I started the brand because I was like, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5301.02s)]
*  if I can't find any sponsors, why not take the entrepreneur out and sponsor myself? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5304.02s)]
*  So now I have, you know, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5308.02s)]
*  Southern Company and Georgia Power being one of my sponsors for professional golf, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5310.02s)]
*  along with a couple of other companies in Atlanta. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5315.02s)]
*  But it's, I mean, the whole thing is sponsorship is dollars. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5319.02s)]
*  If you can raise that and that company can see what they can really get out of you, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5322.02s)]
*  where it comes to like a certain type of customer or a certain type of field, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5327.02s)]
*  they'll pay you for it. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5331.02s)]
*  All right. We got more with Eastside Golf. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5332.02s)]
*  When we come back, don't move. It's the Breakfast Club. Good morning. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5334.02s)]
*  Good morning, everybody. It's EJ, Envy, Jess Hilarious, Charlamagne the Guy. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5337.02s)]
*  We are the Breakfast Club. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5341.02s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Eastside Golf, Elijah Wanaginaku and Earl Cooper. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5343.02s)]
*  Charlamagne? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5347.02s)]
*  I love both of y'all. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5348.02s)]
*  I love y'all stories because y'all represent, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5349.02s)]
*  I like when people get into an industry and they show all sides of the industry. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5351.02s)]
*  Because when I hear PGA professional, I'm thinking that's a player. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5355.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5357.02s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5358.02s)]
*  Not somebody who does the business. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5359.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5360.02s)]
*  And that's like, damn, there's so many different ways for us to be involved in this sport. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5361.02s)]
*  Yeah. No, I completely agree. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5365.02s)]
*  And I feel like that's one of the things that I'll say really just excites me about. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5367.02s)]
*  Our business is the fact that we're having an impact on the sport without actually playing it. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5373.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5378.02s)]
*  And so it's kind of like a basketball analogy would be like, we working in the front office. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5379.02s)]
*  Right. And so we're getting everyone excited and bringing everyone along with us. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5383.02s)]
*  Right. Like when you think about when the brand started, it was right before COVID. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5388.02s)]
*  And then, you know, our first viral moment was Chris Paul wearing it head to toe when he was a player, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5392.02s)]
*  when he was the president of NBA Players Association, the night of the boycott of the event that happened in Kenosha, Wisconsin. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5397.02s)]
*  And so like that's that's how we kind of went viral. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5403.02s)]
*  But it was through basketball. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5406.02s)]
*  And then from there, you know, we got hooked up with Michael Jordan and we've had like C.C. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5408.02s)]
*  Sabathe, Victor Cruz, you know, Peckers, Steve Stout, like you name it. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5413.02s)]
*  All of these guys are like we see exactly what you guys are doing. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5418.02s)]
*  Right. Like you are bringing in people into the game culturally relevant in a way like our tagline is, you know, be authentic. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5421.02s)]
*  So that's that's all we require. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5429.02s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. I can think of times, right? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5431.02s)]
*  Like when I was younger, you know, me and my now wife walking into restaurants in South Carolina, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5433.02s)]
*  seeing nothing but white people in there, nothing but white people working there and saying to ourselves, yeah, this ain't for us. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5438.02s)]
*  And I remember one time in particular, you know, we went to one and it was like, oh, no, we leaving. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5444.02s)]
*  And the waitress was like, the woman at the door was like, why are you all leaving? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5448.02s)]
*  Because it's too many white people. And I was like, yeah, the golf course probably is 10 times as intimidating as that. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5450.02s)]
*  And just because it's like we don't see each other out there. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5456.02s)]
*  So if a couple of guys just pull up on the golf course, are they going to are they going to be welcomed? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5459.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, well, so they have private country clubs and then they have municipalities. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5463.02s)]
*  They have municipalities, as he once said, public parks, downtown, which you pay your tax dollars on. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5467.02s)]
*  That's what we need to be. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5471.02s)]
*  A lot of those a lot of those golf courses are definitely welcoming. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5473.02s)]
*  They know it's your first time coming out there. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5476.02s)]
*  And on top of that, you know, some some of these golf courses have a bucket of balls might be 12 bucks and play it against sports. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5478.02s)]
*  Cheap for some balls. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5485.02s)]
*  Pause. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5486.02s)]
*  What's wrong with y'all? Grow up, y'all. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5487.02s)]
*  Pause. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5490.02s)]
*  What's your problem, y'all? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5491.02s)]
*  Cheap for some balls. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5492.02s)]
*  What is your problem? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5493.02s)]
*  Cheap for some balls. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5495.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5496.02s)]
*  So some golf balls. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5497.02s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5498.02s)]
*  Continue. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5499.02s)]
*  Yeah, we got it. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5500.02s)]
*  Cheap. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5501.02s)]
*  Like we had to continue on. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5502.02s)]
*  So downtown bucket of golf balls might be 12 bucks, but then you can go to play it against sports and get a whole thing of clubs, 14 clubs for $100, $125. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5504.02s)]
*  And this is an investment. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5515.02s)]
*  You know, like whatever. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5516.02s)]
*  And I see this all the time. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5518.02s)]
*  Whatever you do with your life. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5519.02s)]
*  I don't care what you do. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5520.02s)]
*  If you play golf, it will increase that revenue. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5521.02s)]
*  It will increase whatever opportunities you have. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5524.02s)]
*  Why? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5526.02s)]
*  So many different types of people play golf. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5527.02s)]
*  I mean, I've met guys that, you know, own movie companies, guys, investors out in Palo Alto. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5530.02s)]
*  I mean, all the way over to being at Liberty National, the firemen family that sold Reebok. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5536.02s)]
*  You know, all of these different types of people play golf. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5542.02s)]
*  Doctors, lawyers, the same type of people that I grew up seeing. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5545.02s)]
*  But the connection that they have in their circle. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5548.02s)]
*  I mean, if you play golf, you can go out. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5552.02s)]
*  Well, let me invite my guy. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5554.02s)]
*  All of a sudden you got a foursome, three, four guys out there playing golf and you don't know who it is. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5555.02s)]
*  You know, relax. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5560.02s)]
*  You know, since the big cage is going on right now, you know, people's ears are sensitive. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5562.02s)]
*  You say a foursome. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5568.02s)]
*  Everybody trying to figure out. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5569.02s)]
*  Wow. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5570.02s)]
*  Y'all don't have gay ears. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5571.02s)]
*  Really? Yes. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5573.02s)]
*  This guy has gay ears. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5574.02s)]
*  I'm listening to you because I'm intrigued by what you're saying. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5575.02s)]
*  I don't have gay ears. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5578.02s)]
*  You ain't got a foursome. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5579.02s)]
*  No, I've heard that before. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5580.02s)]
*  I've heard everybody say that, you know, they golf because it's great for networking. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5582.02s)]
*  Sure. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5585.02s)]
*  You know, I've golfed once. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5586.02s)]
*  I was terrible at it. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5588.02s)]
*  I got frustrated. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5589.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5590.02s)]
*  But it's a time for men to do something we don't do, which is talk. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5591.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5596.02s)]
*  You know, for a long period of time, it's good bonding for men, I think. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5597.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5600.02s)]
*  No, I agree. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5601.02s)]
*  We're not going to go off course with them. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5602.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5603.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5604.02s)]
*  Nah, and it's funny you said men because we actually we're doing a campaign featuring [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5605.02s)]
*  Justin Tuck just talking about fathers because a lot of times, again, you're talking about [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5609.02s)]
*  that opportunity to bond and like it's a great sport like to just go out there. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5613.620000000001s)]
*  And a lot of times that's a man's hobby. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5619.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5621.02s)]
*  I mean, we definitely support the women to get out there as well. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5622.02s)]
*  And I agree that golf can be intimidating. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5625.02s)]
*  Like, look, I was the first African American golf professional at two golf courses that [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5627.02s)]
*  were over 100 years old. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5633.02s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5635.02s)]
*  So the 1899 Detroit Golf Club in Wilmington Country Club in Wilmington. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5636.02s)]
*  I started out as a caddy there. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5639.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5641.02s)]
*  So like you should dream of going in the clubhouse like, man, like, what would that be like? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5642.02s)]
*  And, you know, the point and I feel like the reason why I took both of those roles was [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5646.02s)]
*  simply because he has an opportunity to reset the standard. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5650.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5653.02s)]
*  They don't know they've never even interact with someone at that level in that position. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5654.02s)]
*  And so it's important that we do go and kind of push through that uncomfortableness. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5658.02s)]
*  And that's kind of what I'm saying, where as an adult, if the adults can go, we know [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5662.02s)]
*  it's just going to they're going to look up to you, you know. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5667.02s)]
*  And so if they see you doing the goal for us, we don't want it to be a shock when we [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5670.02s)]
*  show up or minorities show up and they're playing golf. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5676.02s)]
*  We want that to be normalized. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5680.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5682.02s)]
*  But that's up to us to normalize it amongst that generation. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5683.02s)]
*  Just like we normalize everything else. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5685.02s)]

*  Also Nailah, we gotta salute Leia, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5940.900000000001s)]
*  cause we said she was signed, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5943.7s)]
*  she said she's not signed, she's independent. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5945.8s)]
*  Yeah, Leia said she's not signed, she's independent. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5947.320000000001s)]
*  I know she's not signed, you said she was signed. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5948.84s)]
*  I Googled it, Google said she was signed, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5950.88s)]
*  well she signed before, right? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5952.52s)]
*  And now she's not signed now. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5953.52s)]
*  She was signed before, yeah. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5954.360000000001s)]
*  But then once you said that, I was like, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5955.2s)]
*  dang, maybe she got re-signed, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5956.68s)]
*  so then I didn't say anything. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5957.96s)]
*  I thought you said not yet, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5958.8s)]
*  I thought you said not yet last week. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5960.08s)]
*  About Leia? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5961.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5962.400000000001s)]
*  Last time I knew she was not signed. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5963.240000000001s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5964.4800000000005s)]

*  she's independent now. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5966.16s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5967.0s)]
*  Yeah, she did a whole video on it. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5967.820000000001s)]
*  But Leia's been going up, man. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5968.66s)]
*  I like it. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5970.68s)]
*  I love her, love her so much. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5971.52s)]
*  All right. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5973.200000000001s)]

*  Okay, you too. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5981.8s)]
*  All right, everybody else, the People's Choice Mix is up. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5982.64s)]
*  Next, don't move, it's the Breakfast Club, good morning. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5984.64s)]
*  Wake up, wake up, you're locked into the Breakfast Club. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5986.64s)]
*  Morning, everybody, it's DJ Envy, Jess Hilarious, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5990.240000000001s)]
*  Charlamagne the Guy, we are the Breakfast Club. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5993.52s)]
*  We gotta salute the cast of The Wire for joining us today. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5995.92s)]
*  Man, they celebrating 23 years, man. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=5998.280000000001s)]
*  They're enjoying it, yeah. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6001.0s)]
*  Why, I just don't, what couldn't be done with The Wire? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6002.08s)]
*  Like, I feel like The Wire need to have like a documentary, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6004.400000000001s)]
*  maybe a reunion. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6007.56s)]
*  Yeah, definitely a documentary, yo, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6009.08s)]
*  but they can't do a spin-off. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6010.360000000001s)]
*  I don't want them to mess it up. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6011.84s)]
*  Like, the blueprint was great. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6013.360000000001s)]
*  Now, remember a couple years later, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6015.08s)]
*  a show called The Cornerhead came out, right? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6017.04s)]
*  Yep, mm-hmm. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6018.8s)]
*  And I felt like they tried to do the same type of thing. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6019.96s)]
*  It didn't really stick for me, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6023.24s)]
*  but we've seen that try to be done over and over. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6025.08s)]
*  It just, it don't come close. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6028.24s)]
*  So, I think a documentary would be the right thing. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6029.52s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I do think that ship is sailed, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6031.84s)]
*  but I do think back in the day, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6033.68s)]
*  wire spin-offs would have worked [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6035.240000000001s)]
*  if they would have kept like the same writers, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6036.6s)]
*  the same producers, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6038.68s)]
*  because they could have created their own world. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6039.6s)]
*  They could have gone to different cities. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6041.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, just like the Power University thing. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6042.64s)]
*  Like, plenty of those guys could have left, [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6044.320000000001s)]
*  set up shops somewhere else, the one that lived. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6046.360000000001s)]
*  You know, they could go back to that though, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6048.56s)]
*  because so many people are intrigued [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6049.64s)]
*  with the street lifestyle and selling drugs and all that. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6051.240000000001s)]
*  People love seeing those type of things. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6054.080000000001s)]
*  Those movies do well, those shows do well. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6055.72s)]
*  You go to another place, like you go to DC, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6057.96s)]
*  you go to Detroit, you go to New York, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6059.92s)]
*  you go to a small town somewhere that we might not know. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6062.04s)]
*  Like Sharla said, though, it gotta be written right. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6066.08s)]
*  The dialogue gotta be exactly the streets, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6068.72s)]
*  like exactly what it really is. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6071.72s)]
*  Yeah, all right. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6073.76s)]
*  And also, Asai Gar for joining us this morning. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6074.84s)]
*  Man, I am really inspired by what them brothers are doing, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6077.4s)]
*  just because they're doing something different. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6080.4s)]

*  that you don't really see a lot of us doing, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6084.28s)]
*  and they're having a lot of success. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K_syliLHDc&t=6086.28s)]
