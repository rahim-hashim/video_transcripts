*  He's not quite met ready to make that designation as of yet. So let's hear those comments from him [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=276.48s)]
*  We're not calling it a terror attack at this point again. It's way too early to speculate motive [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=281.64s)]
*  You know, I know there's a lot out there in social media [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=286.28s)]
*  But I ask people just to give us a little bit of patience while we work through a really complex scene [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=288.6s)]
*  This was a beautiful Sunday afternoon in downtown Boulder on on Pearl Street [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=292.92s)]
*  And this act is unacceptable [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=298.36s)]
*  Yes [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=300.92s)]
*  so some of the injuries are reportedly life-threatening and the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=301.44s)]
*  Anti-defamation League said on social media that the attack took place at the Boulder run for their lives event [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=304.2s)]
*  The weekly gathering for Jewish community members is meant to support the hostages taken during the October at seventh attacks in Israel in 2023 [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=309.56s)]
*  So ours to do so horrible guys posted on that there's um, I'm in other news [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  The Trump administration is confident it will overcome any court challenges to its tariff policy now [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News Sunday that the latest challenge put the trade team back about a week in terms of their goals [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=328.44s)]
*  But they added he added that the country has returned to the bargaining table and let Nick says the court challenges [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=335.84s)]
*  That's the court challenge to tariffs was just a speed bump, but he believes the White House will prevail in court [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=341.96s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=347.46s)]
*  I think it cost us a week [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=349.46s)]
*  Cost us a week, but then everybody came right back to the table [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=352.2s)]
*  We're gonna take that up to higher courts the president's going to win like he always does but rest assured [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=355.44s)]
*  Tariffs are not going away [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=361.88s)]
*  So let Nick affirm the constitutional powers that the president has to enact emergency tariffs if the nation is at risk [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=365.44s)]
*  Trump's tariff plan was reinstated by federal appeals court last week after it was halted by a lower court [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=372.23999999999995s)]
*  So remember I said good luck trying to keep up with the tariffs now that a tariff block has [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  Officially been lifted since the last time we spoke on Friday and more specifically the White House says a trade deal with China [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=381.94s)]
*  Is coming maybe as soon as this week White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett was asked about the status of trade [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=388.0s)]
*  Negotiations on ABC's this week and he says the tariff battle with China is still being worked out. Let's take a listen [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=394.71999999999997s)]
*  The president's we expect will discuss the matter this week [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=401.14s)]
*  What's that things resolved that we're gonna take deals into the oval that James Agrior and Howard Lutnick have negotiated? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=404.06s)]
*  So has it added that he expects President Trump will update the tariff plan this week and China excuse me Trump accused China of violating [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=410.54s)]
*  Its trade deal and announced that he was doubling [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=417.92s)]
*  Steel and aluminum tariffs. So again, we'll keep you posted on how these trade deals and tariffs work out as a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=421.5s)]
*  Time arises. It looks like we have a little bit more time for one more [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=428.62s)]
*  So I'm gonna go a little positive with this one June marks Pride Month the celebration of LGBTQ history identity and progress [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=431.54s)]
*  It all started with the first pride parade in 1971 year after the Stonewall riots in New York sparked [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=438.94s)]
*  National push for LGBTQ riots or excuse me rights [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=445.34000000000003s)]
*  the White House officially recognized Pride Month in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=449.06s)]

*  homosexuality a crime so but it does seem like things are [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=458.06s)]

*  Cardi B saw our report and I she saw the reports of the spousal [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1078.78s)]
*  spousal support spousal request and she got onto the spaces and she [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1083.62s)]
*  She spoke for herself. Let's take listen to Cardi on spousal support [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1089.02s)]
*  The fact that I'm waking up right now to see that this [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1092.14s)]
*  Girl and his team. I don't know. I know it's not his team. I know it's his [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1095.58s)]
*  Gonna tell the Breakfast Club [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1101.1399999999999s)]
*  The only reason why this mother asking for spousal support because I was asking for everything and because I don't be with my kids [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1102.9s)]
*  Yo, you such a fucking [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1109.98s)]
*  Word to my mother I want you to die but I want you to die [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1113.22s)]
*  Where you die? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1118.42s)]

*  I think of me when I first filed for divorce my lawyer filed for shit and this started spazzing, right? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1122.22s)]
*  So I told my lawyer I asked for no child support because I want to be done with this marriage [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1128.3s)]
*  Like I feel like I'm tied up [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1134.6999999999998s)]
*  Nobody wants you don't want your kids father to die. Yeah, I think she just she's upset [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1137.62s)]
*  And so then after this [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1142.9399999999998s)]
*  sometime after this [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1145.58s)]
*  Well first let's there's another audio because then she talks about actually being able to the whole kids thing because it was the claim [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1147.6599999999999s)]
*  allegedly that [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1154.34s)]
*  So then there's not a good relationship as far as like [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1155.8999999999999s)]
*  Cardi with her kids or him being able to see the kids and she spoke to that. Let's take a listen [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1158.82s)]
*  Kiari is allowed to see my kids. He stood up my kids three times [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1162.6599999999999s)]
*  He has seen blossom only like five times and I've been trying to save your face [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1167.4199999999998s)]
*  But for you stop playing stand down I don't be seeing my kids because you don't want to look like a less of a [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1173.1799999999998s)]
*  I allow you to talk to the kids every single day if I allow you to talk to the kids [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1178.86s)]
*  Why would I not allow you not to see the kids? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1182.8999999999999s)]
*  It was a point that he was making a big deal like oh [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1185.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm not gonna go to New York to see the kids because I'm not gonna be seeing my kids in a hotel room [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1187.94s)]
*  I said, you know what to make it easier for you [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1192.8999999999999s)]
*  You could see the kids in my house just because I want my daughter to feel the love of her dad [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1195.7s)]
*  Okay, so before you start talking to me out of I don't see my kids you ever seen the kids since March I [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1201.34s)]
*  Don't want to know any of this. I don't want to hear about any of this like something should be worked out behind closed doors [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1207.1399999999999s)]
*  It's it's just sad to see a relationship happen like that. Yes, it's just so damn sad [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1211.98s)]
*  Yeah, and then so following this some some time in between and I'm sure Cardi's haters love this [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1217.02s)]
*  They love to see when you're going through it. Of course. Yeah, I think offsets to like they both of them [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1222.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure because people had so much opinions and stuff about their relationships [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1227.7s)]
*  Anyway, let me get those photos about their relationship [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1230.74s)]
*  anyway [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1232.94s)]
*  so people this this just adds to the conversation people are then able to have but following this because there was a lot of back and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1233.38s)]

*  Now over the week the nicks we're getting a lot [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1618.0s)]
*  Over the weekend the nicks were eliminated [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1621.0s)]
*  Oh you can't even get it out [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1623.0s)]
*  I can't the Paces beat the Knicks 125-108 [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1625.0s)]

*  It wasn't even the fact that they lost they just got their ass busted [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1632.0s)]
*  Did you think about how they fumbled in game one the Knicks didn't want to win that series [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1635.0s)]
*  Yeah it was horrible horrible horrible horrible [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1638.0s)]
*  But what's up Morgan? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1641.0s)]
*  Good morning Andy I'm so sorry you know thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1643.0s)]
*  Let's talk about Trump's big beautiful bill [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1646.0s)]
*  So House Speaker Mike Johnson says the White House spending bill will actually strengthen Medicaid [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1648.0s)]
*  Of course this is from opposition on the other side of the aisle [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1653.0s)]
*  Now Johnson told NBC's Meet the Press the bill protects all safety net programs by implementing much needed reforms [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1657.0s)]
*  He added that it will cut the deficit by over a trillion dollars over 10 years [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1663.0s)]
*  Let's take a listen to House Speaker Mike Johnson on Trump's big beautiful bill [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1669.0s)]
*  There are no Medicaid cuts in the big beautiful bill [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1672.0s)]
*  We're not cutting Medicaid what we're doing is strengthening the program [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1676.0s)]
*  We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1680.0s)]
*  The reason we call it the big beautiful bill is because it is a tremendous pro-growth package entwined in this legislation [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1682.0s)]
*  That is going to make everybody's incomes go up there's going to be more job opportunity [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1688.0s)]
*  So the Senate will now debate the measure where Republicans can only afford to lose three votes [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1692.0s)]
*  The multi-trillion dollar tax and spending package narrowly passed the House last month [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1697.0s)]
*  And after the Senate votes House lawmakers will have to approve changes to the bill [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1701.0s)]
*  I believe their deadline they're looking at is July 4th to get that passed [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1707.0s)]
*  So we will keep you guys posted on that [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1712.0s)]
*  Here's the thing too if they aren't cutting Medicaid you will know [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1715.0s)]
*  So if your Medicaid gets cut you will know they lied to you [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1719.0s)]
*  So please remember Speaker Mike Johnson saying that they aren't cutting Medicaid [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1722.0s)]
*  I hope they're not cutting it [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1726.0s)]
*  But if they do cut it you will know that they lied to you [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1727.0s)]
*  They say they're not cutting the Medicaid right [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1730.0s)]
*  But they're saying they're rooting out the waste fraud and abuse of it [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1732.0s)]
*  So basically if you're an illegal alien or if you're somebody you know here that may not you know supposed to be there [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1734.0s)]
*  If they supposedly feel that you don't qualify then yeah but that's where the cuts are [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1741.0s)]
*  But that's when they're saying that's where it's that gray area of where they say it's supposed to be waste fraud and abuse [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1745.0s)]
*  But you know I'm not going to get too much into that [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1750.0s)]
*  On the other side of the aisle Democrats say Trump's so-called big beautiful bill will kill Americans [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1752.0s)]
*  That's what Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy told CNN State of the Union [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1757.0s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1760.0s)]
*  When you lose your health care you are much more at risk of early death [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1762.0s)]
*  When rural hospitals close because of this bill [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1766.0s)]
*  When drug treatment clinics close in Iowa and rural America because of this bill [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1769.0s)]
*  More people will die at a younger age [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1774.0s)]
*  So Murphy says he fears rural communities will suffer the most if the bill is signed into law [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1777.0s)]
*  Democrats say the White House tried is trying to cut Medicaid and other social safety nets by billions of dollars [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1781.0s)]
*  Now Republicans say they are much needed reforms to the programs that will cut the deficit [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1787.0s)]
*  So again we'll keep you guys posted as of today [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1793.0s)]
*  Congress is still in recess but they will be back in session tomorrow [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1796.0s)]
*  And I'm gonna be up there asking all the questions [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1798.0s)]
*  So President Trump he says he will seek congressional approval for Doge related spending cuts in this fiscal year [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1801.0s)]
*  Now the Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vogt says the White House will use a special tool that recommends Congress take back spending that is already approved [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1807.0s)]
*  That's called the Empowerment Control Act [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1817.0s)]
*  The ICA, Empowerment Control Act, specifically addresses the President's ability to withhold or delay the spending of funds already appropriated by Congress [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1820.0s)]
*  Now Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vogt describes the rarely used procedure [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1829.0s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1833.0s)]
*  It's a provision that has been rarely used but it is there and we intend to use all of these tools [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1835.0s)]
*  We want Congress to pass it where it's necessary [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1841.0s)]
*  We also have executive tools [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1844.0s)]
*  The very Empowerment Control Act itself allows for a procedure called pocket rescissions later in the year to be able to bank some of these savings without the bill actually being passed [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1845.0s)]
*  So he told CNN's State of the Union it was used for over 200 years but stopped in the 1970s leading to fraud and abuse [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1857.0s)]
*  So I'll keep you guys posted on what they're gonna be trying to you know what basically what programs or where that money will be coming from and how it will be replaced or reused in other areas [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1865.0s)]
*  That one's fairly interesting [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1878.0s)]
*  And one last one I think is impacting a lot of people seem to be a lot of very upset about this [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1879.0s)]
*  The Department of Labor has suspended operations at more than 100 job core centers nationwide [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1884.0s)]
*  The center in Detroit's a center in Detroit shut down last week well ahead of the June 30th deadline for operations to be suspended leaving alumni and others in shock and announcing what is called a phased pause [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1889.0s)]
*  The Labor Department said the program was no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1901.0s)]
*  In addition, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-Deremmer pointed to a number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1907.0s)]
*  So that seems to be a developing story is breaking overnight [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1916.0s)]
*  So I'm going to keep you guys posted as well as to what happens as a result of these job labor core or excuse me job core centers being shut down nationwide [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1920.0s)]
*  But that could pretty much conclude your front page news [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1930.0s)]

*  Okay yeah [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1979.0s)]
*  I knew you was going to be with it [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1981.0s)]
*  Man I laughed so hard you know why? Cause it felt warm [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1984.0s)]
*  Right [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1987.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying regardless of what you said that people might be offended by it just felt like it was coming from a good place [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1988.0s)]
*  Yeah they'll be alright that's the problem man the comedy is just everybody is too sensitive right now [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=1994.0s)]
*  We need to get back to the 90s when comedians did what they did [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2000.0s)]
*  Eddie Murphy Raw is still funny [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2004.0s)]
*  I don't get offended at nothing [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2006.0s)]
*  Eddie Murphy Delirious is funny [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2008.0s)]
*  Jamie Foxx, Martin Lawrence, those specials are, Mark Curry [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2010.0s)]
*  All of those specials are still funny man we just in a council culture [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2014.0s)]
*  And on this one I just say what the hell I want to say and just have fun with the audience [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2018.0s)]
*  The audience that came out to see you they said we want you and that's what I gave them [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2023.0s)]
*  I wouldn't want a young kid to watch Eddie Murphy Raw Delirious [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2027.0s)]
*  Especially a young member of the LGBTQ community [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2030.0s)]
*  You gotta ease into that one [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2034.0s)]
*  You can't just turn that one on now [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2036.0s)]
*  But is that why it took you 10 years to do another special? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2040.0s)]
*  No man you know what happened I got into radio, got into raising the kids [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2043.0s)]
*  I was still performing on the weekends you just have to give yourself some space [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2048.0s)]
*  Give yourself a cushion to have a balanced life [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2052.0s)]
*  You know do radio, do shows or whatever but then push the kids on the swing set and just have some fun [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2055.0s)]
*  And enjoy life and sit on the beach a few weekends instead of 3 shows on a Saturday, 2 shows on a Friday [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2061.0s)]
*  And it ain't the shows it's the in between shows [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2068.0s)]
*  So Jess you know the 2 and a half to 3 hour wait for you to go back on stage in between shows [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2071.0s)]
*  Sitting in a room with comedians and we run out of things to talk about and your voice gone [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2078.0s)]
*  And that was kind of I just needed a cushion [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2083.0s)]
*  So I didn't put pressure on myself to do another one I just kept performing in David Talbert [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2087.0s)]
*  And Len Talbert it was like hey man you need to do another special you haven't done one in years [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2092.0s)]
*  I said okay so I was like cool and we did it we shot it did 3 shows [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2097.0s)]
*  And it was fun I had a good time [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2101.0s)]
*  If I had one critique I just felt like I had something to prove [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2104.0s)]
*  And I think I should have just took a deep breath and just relaxed a little bit [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2109.0s)]
*  When I go back and look at it you know you're your own worst critic [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2112.0s)]
*  You hear yourself on the radio you're going to turn the station you ain't going to sit up and listen to it [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2115.0s)]
*  I can't stand to listen to myself [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2119.0s)]
*  Prove to who? Who you got to prove to? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2121.0s)]
*  It felt like you just had something to prove like you coming out [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2123.0s)]
*  Like, like, like, like, come down [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2127.0s)]
*  It was like a walk in the park it was like an uncle at a cookout [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2130.0s)]
*  That's what I was going to ask you did you write anything? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2133.0s)]
*  It just seemed like you just had it and it was just it was there [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2136.0s)]
*  Yeah, just I had been working on some of that material for years [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2139.0s)]
*  And it was just sharp it was developed I had did it in comedy club [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2144.0s)]

*  That wasn't no written joke because you can't, the joke was not developed. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2642.0s)]
*  Right because COVID had just came out so it's fresh. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2647.0s)]
*  So he off the top of his head he ripping. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2649.0s)]
*  I'm seeing drug dealers with necklaces on falling all on the floor crying people getting [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2651.0s)]
*  up slapping each other. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2656.0s)]
*  You ain't seen that in death jam. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2657.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2659.0s)]
*  Not that kind of man. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2660.0s)]
*  Slapping each other. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2661.0s)]
*  You know how black people got to be. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2662.0s)]
*  What's success to you when it comes to that special or just getting it out? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2664.0s)]
*  Is that just. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2669.0s)]
*  Making sure that it's special. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2670.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2672.0s)]
*  They call them specials but the question becomes you want it to be special. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2673.0s)]
*  You want it to be one that you and your mom going to pull out on Thanksgiving. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2677.0s)]
*  Like this special right here. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2681.0s)]
*  I believe that they're going to pull it out every Thanksgiving and every Christmas. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2683.0s)]
*  We're going to sit down and watch the special. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2686.0s)]
*  Not a lot of cussing. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2688.0s)]
*  Maybe one or two cuss words. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2689.0s)]
*  You can watch it with your kids. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2690.0s)]
*  They can get by to one or two cuss words that I use. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2692.0s)]
*  And you know every Thanksgiving and Christmas that's going to be something that people will [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2695.0s)]
*  watch just like they watch Lil Darryl and the how you do that with the bass guitar. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2699.0s)]
*  Charlamagne I had that in there. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2703.0s)]
*  We had to edit it out because I couldn't get 10 percent. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2705.0s)]
*  So whoever owned 10 percent of that song we could not find them to pay them. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2708.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2712.0s)]
*  Or whatever. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2713.0s)]
*  But the Thanksgiving and the Christmas part of it is my favorite. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2714.0s)]
*  Tommy Davidson FaceTime me yesterday still laughing at one joke about the midget. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2717.0s)]
*  And it just wiped him out. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2723.0s)]
*  He went. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2725.0s)]
*  Yo. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2726.0s)]
*  We were at the improv in Hollywood. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2727.0s)]
*  Tommy Davidson went from table to table repeating this joke while they were still showing. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2730.0s)]
*  On the screen he would sit his ass down and he was going from table to table just repeating [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2734.0s)]
*  that joke and I just sat back. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2739.0s)]
*  Salute to Tommy. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2741.0s)]
*  That's a lot of funny. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2742.0s)]
*  I like when you say you call yourself trying. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2744.0s)]
*  That is so true. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2746.0s)]
*  Every uncle. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2751.0s)]
*  Every grandmother. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2754.0s)]
*  The black mamas don't play that. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2755.0s)]
*  The white people say oh my God my daughter is gay. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2757.0s)]
*  The black mamas where Brianna. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2762.0s)]
*  She's not there calling herself like a bitch. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2764.0s)]
*  That's some holiday shit though. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2768.0s)]
*  That's when you find out about that table shit. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2770.0s)]
*  And all people missing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2773.0s)]
*  Nobody asks you. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2775.0s)]
*  We ask where is Brianna. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2776.0s)]
*  Why does she have to say that? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2779.0s)]
*  Why can't she just say she's in the back room. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2781.0s)]
*  Back there and hear something that's calling herself. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2783.0s)]
*  Like. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2786.0s)]
*  That was the moment they hit the floor. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2789.0s)]
*  That was funny man. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2791.0s)]
*  Do you ever feel like you have to reinvent yourself for the new generation? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2793.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2797.0s)]
*  I did at one point. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2798.0s)]
*  But I stopped doing that. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2799.0s)]
*  I just started feeling like I have a fan base. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2800.0s)]
*  I have audience that love me. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2803.0s)]
*  And love what I do. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2805.0s)]
*  And y'all don't ever forget this. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2806.0s)]
*  Stick to what you do. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2808.0s)]
*  You don't have to fit in with certain crowds and certain cultures and certain organizations. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2809.0s)]
*  You don't have to fit in and do what you do. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2814.0s)]
*  Why do people come to see you? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2816.0s)]
*  I don't care who's funny and how funny they are. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2819.0s)]
*  You might not be as funny. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2822.0s)]
*  Do you? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2824.0s)]
*  You know God brought you here for a reason. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2825.0s)]
*  Like these last two years have been the toughest two years of my life. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2828.0s)]
*  I wrote my son's name and birth date on the wrist of my arm before I went on stage. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2832.0s)]
*  Because my son was a comedian. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2837.0s)]
*  And my son is on the special. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2839.0s)]
*  So after I say good night or whatever and the credits rolling. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2841.0s)]
*  You will see a clip of me and Brandon on stage. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2844.0s)]
*  And Brandon standing there performing. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2847.0s)]
*  It shows about five minutes of his performance. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2849.0s)]
*  Split screen with the credits on the other side. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2852.0s)]
*  So what a great way to honor your son. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2855.0s)]
*  With us on stage together like we were. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2858.0s)]
*  I had him on stage when he was seven years old telling the jokes. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2860.0s)]
*  So I would take him on tour. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2863.0s)]
*  Have toys in the dressing room. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2865.0s)]
*  Or whatever. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2867.0s)]
*  Raise all my kids in the dressing room. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2868.0s)]
*  They can tell you what every dressing room looked like. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2869.0s)]
*  So it was a blessing to do that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2871.0s)]
*  We're still kicking in with Ricky Smiley. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2873.0s)]
*  His new comedy special is out on Hulu right now. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2875.0s)]
*  Charlamagne? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2878.0s)]
*  You've always spoke about feeling Brandon's presence during performances. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2879.0s)]
*  So how does that spiritual connection manifest on stage for you? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2883.0s)]
*  It's almost like you're doing it for him. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2886.0s)]
*  You're doing it for your son. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2889.0s)]
*  Now my son or whatever. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2891.0s)]
*  He had his favorite comedians. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2893.0s)]
*  You know your kids always want to try to be different from you. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2894.0s)]
*  I don't want to be like you. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2897.0s)]
*  My son loved Eddie Griffin. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2899.0s)]
*  My son loved Roy Wood Jr. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2901.0s)]
*  And stuff. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2903.0s)]
*  And you know he just had the different comedians that he liked. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2904.0s)]
*  Or whatever. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2908.0s)]
*  You know so he had a whole different style of doing comedy. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2909.0s)]
*  His comedy was more kind of like thoughtful. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2912.0s)]
*  A mix between Roy Wood Jr. and Lil Rel. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2915.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2918.0s)]
*  That was his whole style. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2919.0s)]
*  He was a lot more intelligent on stage. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2921.0s)]
*  So he didn't know a lot of the older comedians. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2924.0s)]
*  He just had his picks. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2926.0s)]
*  Yeah he knew them. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2927.0s)]
*  But he just had his own style of performing. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2928.0s)]
*  I enjoyed him. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2933.0s)]
*  I miss him. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2934.0s)]
*  But these last two years were really really tough. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2935.0s)]
*  I don't wish that on nobody. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2937.0s)]
*  I don't wish that on my worst enemy. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2939.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2941.0s)]
*  So shout out to all the mothers and all the parents out there that had the barrier of [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2942.0s)]
*  child and lost a child. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2946.0s)]
*  Keep your kids in sports. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2947.0s)]
*  Keep them in athletics. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2949.0s)]
*  The discipline and the structure matter. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2950.0s)]
*  We got to learn to give kids more of what we had as opposed to what we did not have. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2952.0s)]
*  That's what's ruining kids. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2956.0s)]
*  If you like who you are, then give the kids what you had. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2958.0s)]
*  I just wish everybody the best and I hope all of y'all kids are safe. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2961.0s)]
*  Graduate college and go on to be productive people. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2966.0s)]
*  I agree with all of that. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2969.0s)]
*  But I will say some of these kids need a little bit more than going to the water fountain. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2970.0s)]
*  If you're dealing with some... [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2974.0s)]
*  So you really need a water fountain? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2976.0s)]
*  Man, what is... yes man. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2978.0s)]
*  If you're dealing with some type of mental health issues or emotional issues, you need [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2980.0s)]
*  more than the water fountain, Ricky. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2985.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2987.0s)]
*  They didn't have medicine for ADHD when we was growing up. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2988.0s)]
*  It was going to the water fountain. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2991.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2993.0s)]
*  Sitting in the classroom with those lights like that going all the way across or whatever [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2994.0s)]
*  just back before you started changing classes. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=2998.0s)]
*  You was in one... [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3000.0s)]
*  You remember that in elementary school? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3001.0s)]
*  Being in one class. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3002.0s)]
*  I don't even know if they got that. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3003.0s)]
*  I keep wondering. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3004.0s)]
*  Do they still got the trailers in the back? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3005.0s)]
*  Nope. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3006.0s)]
*  Hey, stop. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3007.0s)]
*  The trailers? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3008.0s)]
*  What? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3009.0s)]
*  Charlemagne was in one of those classes. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3010.0s)]
*  His class was in the trailer? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3011.0s)]
*  He was on that short bus too for a second too. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3012.0s)]
*  I don't know if they still got the short bus due. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3013.0s)]
*  I don't even see them no more. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3014.0s)]
*  No, they put them on the bus with the regular kids. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3015.0s)]
*  And I know back then they'd go to lunch at 930. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3016.0s)]
*  Yeah, so you could eat before everybody else. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3017.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'd go to lunch at 930 because they'd get out of 12. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3018.0s)]
*  And I had history class first period and I could hear them running down the hall at 930 [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3019.0s)]
*  when that little 930 would be a short bell like, drink, drink or whatever. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3022.0s)]
*  Not a long bell. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3025.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3026.0s)]
*  You can hear them. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3027.0s)]

*  I know her dad, because when people reported this, people were confused as if they didn't [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3431.78s)]
*  know that Rihanna had a relationship with her dad. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3436.42s)]

*  Yeah, but I think with celebrities, if you don't see the parent next to the celebrity [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3448.5400000000004s)]

*  story because literally just like that, no tornado warning, no nothing. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3565.7s)]
*  You just sitting in your house, your son's playing video games, tornado comes through. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3569.66s)]

*  Now Trey's son Malachi did celebrate his 19th birthday in the ICU. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3593.7s)]

*  Let me tell you something else too man. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3661.34s)]
*  The way that he has shown unwavering faith in God through all of this is so impressive [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3665.78s)]
*  because a lot of times we love to praise God when things are going good, but you know, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3673.78s)]
*  you should be giving God the glory all the time, even when things are so-called bad. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3677.42s)]
*  And he is absolutely positively doing that. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3681.2200000000003s)]

*  If not, prayer is free. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3698.6600000000003s)]

*  It plays a big part in the case. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3900.94s)]
*  What does that have to do with anything? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3902.94s)]
*  It plays a big part in the case. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3904.94s)]
*  No, it don't. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3905.94s)]
*  I don't even know why he's testifying. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3906.94s)]
*  They didn't say he was at a Diddy party, did he? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3907.94s)]
*  I just said I'm not clear why he's testifying. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3909.94s)]
*  I've asked people close to me- [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3913.94s)]
*  Man, make sure that's R Enrique. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3915.94s)]
*  Google says that it is. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3917.94s)]
*  Inner City Press says Enrico, Enrique Santos. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3919.94s)]
*  I am very confused here. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3922.94s)]
*  And then after him would be a man named Eddie Garcia who- [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3925.94s)]
*  Eddie? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3928.94s)]
*  That's not our Eddie, right? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3929.94s)]
*  Eddie Garcia, our Eddie from Philly. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3931.94s)]
*  I had no envy getting called. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3933.94s)]
*  It's only a matter of time. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3935.94s)]
*  They're calling Enrique. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3936.94s)]
*  I had no envy getting called. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3937.94s)]
*  Lord have mercy. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3939.94s)]
*  I was never there, sir. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3941.94s)]
*  I never participated, never went, never DJed. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3942.94s)]
*  You was just a rock boy. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3945.94s)]
*  I was just a rock boy for a short period of time. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3946.94s)]
*  I had the audio of Trump talking about pardoning Diddy, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3948.94s)]
*  but y'all didn't spend so much time on it. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3951.94s)]
*  We can play a play again. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3953.94s)]
*  Somebody asked Trump if he was going to pardon Diddy recently [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3954.94s)]
*  over the weekend. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3957.94s)]
*  Let's take a look. Listen. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3958.94s)]
*  Back when you hosted The Apprentice, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3959.94s)]
*  you mentioned once in 2012 that Diddy was a good friend of yours. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3961.94s)]
*  Back then, he has since found himself in some very serious legal trouble. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3964.94s)]
*  Would you ever consider pardoning him? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3969.94s)]
*  Well, nobody's asked. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3972.94s)]
*  You had to be the one to ask, Peter, but nobody's asked. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3974.94s)]
*  But first of all, I look at what's happening, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3976.94s)]
*  and I haven't been watching it too closely, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3979.94s)]
*  although it's certainly getting a lot of coverage. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3981.94s)]
*  I haven't seen him. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3983.94s)]
*  I haven't spoken to him in years. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3984.94s)]
*  He used to really like me a lot. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3986.94s)]
*  I think when I ran for politics, he sort of that relationship busted up [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3988.94s)]
*  from what I read. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3992.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3993.94s)]
*  He didn't tell me that, but I'd read some little bit nasty statements [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3994.94s)]
*  and the paper all of a sudden, you know? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3997.94s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=3999.94s)]
*  I would certainly look at the facts. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4000.94s)]
*  If I think somebody was mistreated, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4002.94s)]
*  whether they like me or don't like me, it wouldn't have any impact. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4004.94s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, and I also asked, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4008.94s)]
*  was there going to be any response from Diddy's attorneys or anybody [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4011.94s)]
*  just in response to Trump saying he would even take a look? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4014.94s)]
*  50 Cent said no. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4017.94s)]
*  50 Cent said he's calling Trump, and he's not having it. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4018.94s)]
*  Diddy has said a lot of dispersant things about Donald Trump, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4022.94s)]
*  and 50 Cent said he's not having it. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4025.94s)]
*  Now, 50 Dove right in it. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4027.94s)]
*  Damn. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4028.94s)]
*  Yeah, he also said, he said, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4029.94s)]
*  I didn't say I was going to nuke anything. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4030.94s)]
*  This was 50 Cent say, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4032.94s)]
*  I simply said I will make sure Trump is aware of the things that Diddy said. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4033.94s)]
*  50 Crazy. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4037.94s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to now I want to know more about the Enrique Santos. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4038.94s)]
*  You too. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4043.94s)]
*  I can't think of nothing else. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4044.94s)]
*  And this nigga told me about my business. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4045.94s)]
*  Like, he's not out. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4047.94s)]
*  Like, he's not out. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4048.94s)]
*  He's the first openly gay broadcaster on Spanish radio. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4049.94s)]
*  He asked us if it was going to be interesting. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4052.94s)]
*  No, I didn't say that because of that. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4054.94s)]
*  I said that because what they got to do with him testify. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4055.94s)]
*  No, it don't matter. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4057.94s)]
*  I asked the question. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4058.94s)]
*  That's why you need to stop listening to this crazy boy over here. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4059.94s)]
*  We're on the radio. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4062.94s)]
*  Like, don't mind my business. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4063.94s)]
*  That was not, that information was not compared to the question. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4065.94s)]
*  No, you didn't. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4069.94s)]
*  You told her that. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4070.94s)]
*  Yes, you did. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4071.94s)]

*  Well, listen, we'll talk after. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4073.94s)]

*  Got a strange one for you tonight out of Modesto. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4153.9s)]
*  The Stanislaus County Sheriff says they've arrested a man last week after he allegedly [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4157.0599999999995s)]
*  broke into a woman's home at night, then bit and licked her toes while she slept. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4161.099999999999s)]
*  Let's give you some context. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4166.9s)]
*  The Sheriff's office says the man arrested seen here, 27-year-old Christian Anguiano, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4168.9s)]
*  have been stalking the woman for months following her home from work several times. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4172.98s)]
*  Despite a number of people confronting him, deputies say he just wouldn't stop. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4177.0199999999995s)]
*  Would even sleep in the car outside her home. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4180.74s)]
*  Woman is okay. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4183.78s)]
*  Anguiano, though, suspects being held on a $325,000 bail. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4184.78s)]
*  He broke into her house just so he could treat her feet like a churro. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4189.259999999999s)]
*  Cinnamon swirl, full-tongue action, sweet sticky, slightly confusing. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4192.259999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4195.5s)]
*  Toe sucking king of the dance floor. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4197.22s)]
*  How you break into someone's house with sozones for their feet? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4199.62s)]
*  This man is a telenovela villain. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4203.9s)]
*  Okay, first of all, what's the point of stalking? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4205.5s)]
*  At what point does a man understand this woman don't want you? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4207.82s)]
*  And what part of your brain makes you believe that breaking into this woman's house and [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4211.7s)]
*  sexually assaulting her toes was going to make her like you? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4215.26s)]
*  Okay, I don't know why I got this far. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4218.34s)]
*  This man was following this woman home after her shifts, sleeping in his car outside her [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4220.4s)]
*  residence, checking her doors to see if they are unlocked to gain entry. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4225.38s)]
*  If he was doing all of that, he should have been on ISIS radar a long time ago. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4228.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, somebody should have been put him in handcuffs. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4233.46s)]
*  This man was confronted by her coworkers to leave her alone, but none of that stopped [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4235.9400000000005s)]
*  him. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4239.18s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4240.18s)]
*  The lesson to be learned here is that this incident underscores the importance of taking [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4241.18s)]
*  stalking behavior seriously. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4244.62s)]
*  And we got to implement stronger protective measures for victims. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4246.82s)]
*  And by stronger measures, we got to let people get their ass kicked. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4250.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4254.54s)]
*  That's what I mean by stronger measures. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4255.54s)]
*  There has to be some sort of community policing that can happen the same way it's citizens [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4256.74s)]
*  arrest. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4261.42s)]
*  We have to make it okay in certain situations for citizens to put their foot up other citizens [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4262.42s)]
*  asses. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4266.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4267.9800000000005s)]
*  Co workers went to him and told him to cut it out. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4268.9800000000005s)]
*  He was sleeping outside that woman's home. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4271.0s)]
*  He was checking for unlocked doors at her residence. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4273.04s)]
*  All of that should equate to a community jumping. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4275.66s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4278.38s)]
*  Now, if that's too extreme for folks, then we got to enhance legal protections. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4279.38s)]
*  All right. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4282.1s)]
*  We got to use strong laws against stalking and ensure swift actions when victims report [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4283.740000000001s)]
*  they are being stalked. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4286.660000000001s)]
*  You got to use stories like this to increase public awareness. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4287.660000000001s)]
*  We have to educate the public about the signs of stalking and the importance of reporting [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4291.14s)]
*  suspicious activities. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4295.9800000000005s)]
*  And most importantly, we got to support the victims. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4297.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4300.46s)]
*  Provide resources and support systems for people who feel threatened. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4301.46s)]
*  You can't wait until somebody breaks into somebody's house and turns their toes into [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4305.22s)]
*  tamales to care. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4309.5s)]

*  Please give Christian Anguiano the sweet sounds of the Hamilton's. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4313.02s)]

*  Well, it's been, you know, it's been a process. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4424.0199999999995s)]
*  So I earned my PhD more than 20 years ago. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4426.54s)]
*  And you know, working on trying to understand specifically for black people, you know, our [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4429.94s)]
*  experiences and trying to integrate that into the larger landscape of mental health that [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4434.9s)]
*  you all know has exploded. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4439.7s)]
*  You know, trying to merge what I know as a black woman. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4442.54s)]
*  And I'm a first generation college student. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4445.7s)]
*  My parents didn't go to college and merging my reality with what I was learning and the [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4447.0599999999995s)]
*  research that I was engaged in and trying to train PhD clinical psychology students. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4451.38s)]
*  You know, that's it took time. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4456.06s)]
*  So it took a little time for me to get here, but I'm here. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4457.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4460.02s)]
*  I noticed that it's not just about mental health. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4461.02s)]
*  It's specifically for black mental health. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4463.54s)]
*  Why is it important to be unapologetic about who this book is for? [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4466.26s)]
*  I'm so glad that you asked that because as you all know, oftentimes, you know, black [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4469.74s)]
*  people get lumped in with minorities. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4474.74s)]
*  One of the labels that we use in academia is BIPOC. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4477.94s)]
*  So black and we include folks with indigenous people of color. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4482.099999999999s)]
*  But we know that black people have a very specific and unique way of just living life, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4486.419999999999s)]
*  of doing things. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4491.62s)]
*  We've learned mental health from the generations before us and in ways that weren't always [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4492.9s)]
*  helpful. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4497.099999999999s)]
*  You know, we learned not to talk about our feelings and emotions. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4498.099999999999s)]
*  Like we learned that. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4500.259999999999s)]
*  Like what we learned impacted who we are while at the same time dealing with racism, dealing [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4501.74s)]
*  with microaggressions, you know, folks saying, you know, pull yourself up by the bootstraps [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4506.86s)]
*  and we don't even have boots. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4510.82s)]
*  You know, that is a reality for us and we need to be able to talk about that. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4511.82s)]
*  And that's part of what makes the book unapologetic is that I said, yeah, we're not talking about [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4515.66s)]
*  everybody. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4519.0199999999995s)]
*  We're just talking about black people. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4520.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4521.0199999999995s)]
*  That's not that it hasn't helped other folks. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4522.0199999999995s)]
*  And I've had people from many communities, you know, gay, straight, black, Asian, we've [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4523.0199999999995s)]
*  all people from many different communities have said that the book has helped them, which [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4527.46s)]
*  is fine. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4531.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, great. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4532.0599999999995s)]
*  Get what you need from the book. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4533.0599999999995s)]
*  But I wrote it for us. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4534.0599999999995s)]
*  How do you handle black people who still think therapy is just white people? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4535.06s)]
*  Well, I say, you know, God bless you. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4538.860000000001s)]
*  And then I talked to them about things that in their language. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4542.46s)]
*  And I think that's part of what made the book resonate is talking to folks in ways that [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4545.54s)]
*  make sense to us. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4550.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons it had to be for us because we talk a certain way. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4551.580000000001s)]
*  And I use that in the book. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4555.5s)]
*  And so, you know, I asked folks about their worry. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4557.3s)]
*  I asked folks about problem sleeping. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4559.860000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of problems with sleep and don't even we normalize it. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4562.66s)]
*  And so I talk about the day to day kinds of things that people experience, but have normalized [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4565.46s)]
*  and then they say, hmm. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4569.9s)]
*  And then we can start to have a conversation from there. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4571.74s)]
*  I got it. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4573.7s)]
*  You got to meet folks where they are. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4574.7s)]
*  Like, and that's that's one of I introduced the idea of psychological fortitude in the [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4575.7s)]
*  book because we say mental health, as you all know, both start thinking, oh, someone's [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4579.5s)]
*  crazy. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4584.34s)]
*  They hear and seeing things that aren't there. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4585.34s)]
*  OK, let's just move by that. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4587.22s)]
*  Let's let's let's keep it moving. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4588.82s)]
*  Figure out how I can help people with a different kind of language. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4590.34s)]
*  I wanted to ask, what are some of the myths that our community still have with therapy? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4592.74s)]
*  Right. We had an artist. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4596.9800000000005s)]
*  His name is Rob for nine. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4598.38s)]
*  You heard of him? What the hell? [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4599.62s)]
*  OK, don't worry about it. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4600.78s)]
*  But he was saying basically that he feels like he needs therapy, but he doesn't necessarily [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4601.9800000000005s)]
*  want to go because he can't he doesn't see himself talking to them people. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4607.34s)]
*  He don't trust him. You know, he doesn't trust him. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4611.46s)]
*  So what is some of the myths that you still see? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4613.38s)]
*  Well, that's certainly one of them. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4615.46s)]
*  They don't tell all my business. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4617.06s)]
*  And that's important. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4618.54s)]
*  We, you know, you can't have folks. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4619.46s)]
*  You can't have your business in the street. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4621.1s)]
*  Like, that's something that that is unacceptable in our community. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4622.38s)]
*  And so for that person and I encounter a lot of those folks who are struggling, you see [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4626.22s)]
*  it, you know, we see it. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4632.42s)]
*  But if they're not ready, then you can't force them to go and talk to someone. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4634.22s)]
*  That's that's one part. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4638.22s)]
*  And I there's so many folks, you know, and that's why we have to be nonjudgmental, because [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4639.66s)]
*  if we say like, this is what I see, just want you to know I'm concerned and then back off, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4644.1s)]
*  then they know who they can go and talk to. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4647.78s)]
*  Like this person expressed concern. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4649.5s)]
*  They seem concerned about me. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4650.9s)]
*  I will go to them. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4652.14s)]
*  But yes, those big myths that are those people are going to tell my business. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4653.3s)]
*  That's one part. The other part is what can they tell me? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4657.06s)]
*  They're not going to be able to tell me they don't they don't even know me. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4659.9800000000005s)]
*  But that's part of the process is getting to know the client. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4662.9800000000005s)]
*  There isn't a single person who would sit in front of me that I would say I know their [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4666.74s)]
*  life story. I know how to help them. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4670.26s)]
*  I'm going to start with questions. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4672.54s)]
*  I got questions first. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4674.06s)]
*  And then the other part is, you know, something I think that is they're going to make me [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4675.7s)]
*  someone that I'm not. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4680.3s)]
*  And I need to maintain myself like I don't know a professional who has the power to be [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4682.26s)]
*  able to magically make someone different. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4687.14s)]
*  The goal would be to make them a better functioning person, you know, to take on their [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4689.54s)]
*  responsibilities and do the best that they can, but not to make them a different person. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4693.26s)]
*  I do have a question. What is a therapist allowed to talk about? [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4696.78s)]
*  Right. So if I see a murder, if I murder somebody, if I see domestic violence, I [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4699.74s)]
*  see somebody getting hurt. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4706.5s)]
*  It always brings me back to the Mendez brothers, right, where they were talking to the [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4707.78s)]
*  therapist and the therapist use some of their stuff on a court case. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4710.54s)]
*  So when you see stuff like that and something is going through my mind, I'm like, I [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4713.78s)]
*  go tell nobody because what if they use it later? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4717.58s)]
*  But then I might have to tell somebody to heal. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4720.58s)]
*  So what can you guys tell? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4722.7s)]
*  And what you know, what is just, you know, patient crimes? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4725.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes, you got to go to prison for us. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4728.34s)]
*  You can kill someone. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4729.46s)]
*  You can go to prison. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4730.1s)]
*  You can go to prison. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4730.74s)]
*  You can go to prison. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4731.26s)]
*  But I'm sure there's people that have seen crimes, have done crimes, and they're going [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4733.26s)]
*  through things like, I'll just use Rob 49 again. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4737.1s)]
*  He said that he's seen so many things in his past. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4739.3s)]
*  He's seen death so much in his past, but he might not want to tell because he might [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4741.82s)]
*  not want to get somebody in trouble. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4745.14s)]
*  Well, in that example, he can say, I've seen deaths. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4746.9s)]
*  Take it out of Rob 49 just in case. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4749.54s)]
*  OK, so anyone can say they've seen something without giving facts or specifics and not [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4751.26s)]
*  expect for the police to come in and haul them off. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4758.54s)]
*  But what I will say is, so we talk in the first session about confidentiality, like [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4760.9s)]
*  confidentiality is part of the bedrock of what we do as licensed professionals. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4764.62s)]
*  Like you can't just go out and yap about what people have been sharing or what they've [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4768.98s)]
*  disclosed in therapy. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4773.3s)]
*  Now, the other thing that we emphasize is if someone says that they could be a harm [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4775.42s)]
*  to themselves or danger to themselves or to someone else, then that information might [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4779.22s)]
*  have to be disclosed in order to be able to protect that person's life or to protect [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4783.54s)]
*  the life of someone else. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4787.38s)]
*  If they are if there's a danger of abuse of children, elderly or people who have [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4789.86s)]
*  disabilities or different abilities, then that would have to be disclosed. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4796.02s)]
*  And to be honest, it varies by state. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4799.62s)]
*  But that's kind of a minimum threshold to be aware of, because at the end of the day, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4801.46s)]
*  the client has to be able to talk to their therapist because they aren't going to be [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4805.9400000000005s)]
*  able to get the healing and the help that they need if they can't get some stuff off [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4809.7s)]
*  of their chest. But then once they do that, then there has to be some understanding about [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4813.1s)]
*  what's going to happen next. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4816.98s)]
*  I was still kicking with Dr. Rita Walker. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4818.5s)]
*  It's the five year anniversary of the unapologetic guide to black men to health. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4820.7s)]
*  Charlamagne. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4824.98s)]
*  We got a good friend, a good friend of mine. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4826.339999999999s)]
*  His name is Humble the Poet. He put out a book called Unanxious, 50 Simple Truths to [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4828.379999999999s)]
*  Help Overthinkers Feel Less Stress and More Calm. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4832.299999999999s)]
*  And I want to read just a quick little line from it because I want to know what you [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4834.7s)]
*  think about it. He says, life doesn't begin after the obstacles. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4838.259999999999s)]
*  Life is the obstacles. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4840.9s)]
*  And we have to unlearn the idea that we need or would even want a life free of chaos, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4841.98s)]
*  stress and anxiety. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4846.66s)]
*  We grow from facing challenges and exploring our limits. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4848.22s)]
*  And the book encourages people to face their stressors and triggers head on with [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4852.26s)]
*  research backed techniques and journal prompts. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4857.5s)]
*  And we had a discussion here on Breakfast Club because I'm like, if I know something [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4860.82s)]
*  triggers me, I reserve the right to disconnect from it and set my boundary and not deal [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4865.22s)]
*  with that thing. He feels like you should sit with the thing so the thing doesn't [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4869.46s)]
*  trigger you anymore. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4873.58s)]
*  Well, I think you know how I feel about the word should. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4874.74s)]
*  So I avoid it at all costs. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4877.78s)]
*  And so if there is something in you that says in this moment, I need to avoid this [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4879.98s)]
*  thing. I'm going to honor that. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4884.54s)]
*  But I'm also going to ask you questions about what is happening for you. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4886.98s)]
*  What are you telling yourself? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4891.14s)]
*  So I'm a cognitive behavioral therapist. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4892.34s)]
*  And so for me, you know, thoughts connect with behaviors, connect with feelings. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4894.78s)]
*  So it all starts with, yes, something happened. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4899.18s)]
*  But what is your thought in response to the thing? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4901.34s)]
*  So is your thought in that moment, I can't deal with this. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4904.099999999999s)]
*  This is going to hurt me. This is going to harm me. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4907.38s)]
*  I can't survive this because it happens. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4909.58s)]
*  It plays out automatically before folks recognize. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4911.78s)]
*  And so we have to slow down the process. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4915.0199999999995s)]
*  OK, tell me the facts. Tell me what happened. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4918.0199999999995s)]
*  I want to know what's going on for you, because I don't assume anything about anybody. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4920.0599999999995s)]
*  So I was like when he was there, I was like, F that adapt. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4923.94s)]
*  Right. And I explained to you if I don't like you because you're a negative person, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4926.339999999999s)]
*  you're always putting me down and I just don't feel good energy around you. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4930.42s)]
*  You don't affect me in any which way. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4935.1s)]
*  So I can cut you off and say, you know what? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4936.780000000001s)]
*  I'm not answering your phone anymore. I don't work with you. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4938.46s)]
*  I don't have to see you. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4940.42s)]
*  And I should that should be my right to do that, because my energy is more important [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4941.38s)]
*  in this friendship. I don't have to sit in it. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4945.1s)]
*  I don't have to adapt. I don't care if you like me or not. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4947.14s)]
*  But that's how we should be. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4949.3s)]
*  I think a lot of times we try to adapt to things and we try to make things right. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4950.540000000001s)]
*  And I think a lot of times it hurts more than help. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4954.34s)]
*  Yeah, you know, and I I respect that 100 percent. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4956.26s)]
*  And I can say that there have been maybe the middle ground, because you never know. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4959.74s)]
*  You just you never know if someone says something to you or they bring you a certain kind of energy. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4963.66s)]
*  And maybe you do have some relationship with the person that you're willing to consider [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4968.86s)]
*  and preserve. Why not say to them, you know, when you do X, Y and Z, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4973.3s)]
*  when you do that thing right there, when you do this, this is how I feel when that happens. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4977.26s)]
*  Maybe they didn't know, you know, maybe they thought they were doing a good thing. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4982.58s)]
*  And I think that's that allows us to be more in community because, you know, we [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4986.139999999999s)]
*  we need more and more community. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4989.38s)]
*  I used to try to think it comes over there. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4992.02s)]
*  Show me something different. Right. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4994.7s)]
*  Short think I used to do that, too. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4995.9800000000005s)]
*  Like you try to adapt to people. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4997.860000000001s)]
*  You do things that sometimes you don't want to do because you feel like it's the right thing to do. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=4999.1s)]
*  Right. And short thick comes over there with be like, no, I'm not going to do it because that doesn't make me happy. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5002.62s)]
*  It might make you happy for what you do. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5008.5s)]
*  I work hard, but I want to protect my peace. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5010.58s)]
*  And I didn't understand it for a while. Right. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5012.06s)]
*  Because short things just wouldn't go. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5013.78s)]
*  He was like, I'm not doing it. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5015.02s)]
*  You know, I catch me and I wouldn't get it. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5016.38s)]
*  But then after a while, I understood. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5018.34s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, if this is going to effort my peace, if this is not going to make me happy, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5020.06s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to stage in my life where, you know what, effort. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5025.38s)]
*  And I agree with short things. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5028.14s)]
*  That's a little pet nickname for me. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5030.1s)]
*  See, I mean, can't even just say my name. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5031.780000000001s)]
*  He can't even say my name. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5034.46s)]
*  He got to give me a little cute nickname to be vulnerable. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5035.3s)]
*  Just to express himself. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5037.620000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? That make you feel better. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5039.14s)]
*  Yes. OK. Thank you. Mental health. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5040.46s)]
*  Thank you. My wife will call it me, girl. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5042.5s)]
*  Thank you. It's my baby over there. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5043.9400000000005s)]
*  That's such a beautiful moment. Yes. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5046.34s)]
*  Dr. Hawking. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5048.1s)]
*  No. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5050.860000000001s)]
*  Look, so just last night, right, I could not go to sleep. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5053.26s)]
*  I have problems sleeping. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5057.46s)]
*  And I noticed you said at the beginning of the interview, right? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5059.34s)]
*  Where. But my thing is, I can't turn my mind off. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5061.42s)]
*  That's the that's the main thing. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5066.14s)]
*  I don't know how to turn my brain off. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5067.740000000001s)]
*  I'm thinking about things I I could be doing rather than getting sleep. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5069.46s)]
*  I'm thinking about, damn, I forgot to do this today. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5073.5s)]
*  It's not enough hours in a day. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5076.5s)]
*  You know, then I got a nine month old, then I'm a wife and then I got it so much. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5078.5s)]
*  So when I'm laying down, I cannot silence my mind, my thoughts to go to sleep. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5082.54s)]
*  Ever. You can't ever. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5089.34s)]
*  Most of the time. Not not ever, because weed will help me do that. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5091.3s)]
*  Just being honest with you, like I will hit a blunt and I will laugh. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5095.78s)]
*  And then I'll be out for a minute. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5100.66s)]
*  But that's really the only thing that helps me get good rest. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5102.74s)]
*  We so, you know, and I've heard you talk about your schedule, you know, and, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5106.82s)]
*  you know, getting up and I think you said like four in the morning, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5111.62s)]
*  but then you go to bed late at night. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5114.86s)]
*  And so, you know, so there's so many different layers to this because, yes, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5116.74s)]
*  you are doing a lot. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5121.5s)]
*  But one of the things that I heard you say just now was even when you're kind of [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5124.0599999999995s)]
*  sitting, you feel like you're supposed to be doing something. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5127.099999999999s)]
*  And so you're also telling yourself, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5130.099999999999s)]
*  I'm supposed to be doing something other than resting. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5132.5s)]
*  So that's that's one thing for you to be mindful of. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5135.74s)]
*  But then, you know, I think it's especially in this day and age, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5138.179999999999s)]
*  it's easy to wake up or not to fall asleep because your mind is is racing. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5141.5s)]
*  I was telling my husband this morning, I woke up at three o'clock [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5147.38s)]
*  and I started to think about this conversation. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5150.54s)]
*  And then I was thinking, OK, I can say this, I'll say that. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5153.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, and oh, and I and I was like, OK, stop. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5155.139999999999s)]
*  And I know better. Right. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5157.74s)]
*  I have the tools and the resources. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5158.86s)]
*  And I was like, quit it. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5160.58s)]
*  And then that didn't work. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5162.099999999999s)]
*  And I said, OK, we're going to do 10 more minutes. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5163.0599999999995s)]
*  And then that didn't work. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5164.9s)]
*  And I was like, OK, we have to start doing our progressive muscle relaxation [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5166.339999999999s)]
*  in order to be able to calm down. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5169.98s)]
*  So there are strategies, progressive muscle relaxation. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5171.46s)]
*  So for me, it's when I close my eyes and I'm breathing deeply [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5174.5s)]
*  and I tell myself that with each exhalation to release the tension [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5178.339999999999s)]
*  and I start with my forehead and eyebrows, because I'm literally sometimes like this [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5182.259999999999s)]
*  in bed, it was intense. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5185.86s)]
*  Yeah. And so I have to tell myself to release and I go everybody part ears, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5188.259999999999s)]
*  nose, and then I allow my body to be able to relax into the moment [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5192.74s)]
*  because I'm literally not just thinking, but I'm feeling it in my body. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5197.42s)]
*  And I have to be able to relax that. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5201.62s)]
*  The other thing that I recommend and I put this in the workbook. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5204.94s)]
*  So I did the unapologetic guy and have the unapologetic workbook [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5208.139999999999s)]
*  is giving folks permission to before you go to bed. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5210.9s)]
*  Like some people need to keep a notepad in a pen, not the phone, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5213.9s)]
*  but a notepad in a pen by the bed so that when all of these thoughts come to mind, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5216.98s)]
*  you write them down, you write them down before you get into bed. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5221.74s)]
*  Like everything that comes about. OK, write it down. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5225.34s)]
*  And then, OK, try that. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5227.38s)]
*  If that, you know, you wake up, OK, write some more down. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5228.78s)]
*  I didn't have a notepad last night. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5231.259999999999s)]
*  OK, we just don't dug this out. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5232.98s)]
*  But be able to write down all the things that come to your mind [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5235.3s)]
*  to release it, because otherwise you're going to ruminate about it. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5238.9s)]
*  And that rumination will absolutely keep you up for hours. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5242.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Absolutely. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5245.62s)]

*  Our adults around us didn't know how to talk to us about mental health. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5270.86s)]
*  This book right here laid it down quite flat. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5273.26s)]

*  Well, it's the latest. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5344.86s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5345.98s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5347.26s)]
*  Lord, can we clarify now? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5348.78s)]
*  Enrique Santos is not the same Enrique Santos that is going to be on the stand [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5350.7s)]
*  today in the Ditty Trial. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5355.22s)]
*  So CNN had put it in a article. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5356.86s)]
*  They then have come back and retracted and they say correction, an earlier version [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5359.94s)]
*  of this post, gave the wrong affiliation for one of the witnesses. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5363.98s)]
*  The prosecution expects to take the stand next week, which is where I believe [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5366.82s)]
*  Google A.I. grabbed the description of Enrique Santos and the reasoning of why [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5370.66s)]
*  he would be on the stand. So when I asked Google why, that is what happened. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5376.0599999999995s)]
*  And Lord have mercy. I'm so sorry, Enrique. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5379.94s)]
*  That's exactly what Enrique just told me. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5382.58s)]
*  He said CNN assumed it was him and reported that it was I Heart Radio's Enrique Santos. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5384.42s)]
*  How does an organization as big as CNN make that mistake? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5389.7s)]
*  I can understand how you can make that mistake because you're getting it from CNN. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5392.46s)]
*  But how does an organization as big as CNN make that kind of mistake? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5396.62s)]
*  That's a really big mistake to make because even me, I kept saying, I'm like, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5400.58s)]
*  this doesn't make any sense. What's his connection? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5403.14s)]
*  I still don't know the real Enrique Santos. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5405.14s)]
*  I still don't know the connection. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5406.78s)]
*  And the court reporters that I follow, they just said the name. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5408.1s)]
*  I reached out to a source close to the case trying to clarify who is Enrique Santos. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5410.46s)]
*  And they were confused as well because they were seeing the conflicting reports as well. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5414.860000000001s)]
*  And then the person told me when they asked for more information, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5418.26s)]
*  they wouldn't give them more information. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5421.1s)]
*  But that that person knew of it was what was out here on Google already. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5422.42s)]
*  That actually could be a lawsuit from Enrique. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5425.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah, 100 percent. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5427.66s)]
*  Easily, because you put that out there on CNN. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5428.58s)]
*  Now I got people threatening me saying, what you going to testify against Diddy Ford? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5431.14s)]
*  That could be emotional distress just like that. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5435.38s)]
*  That is definitely a lawsuit. That's what happened. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5437.42s)]
*  We have to clear this up. I'm so sorry, Enrique. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5438.82s)]
*  I did not mean to disturb. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5440.9800000000005s)]
*  What's up, Enrique? [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5442.02s)]
*  What up, Enrique? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5443.14s)]
*  Well, now I know who Enrique Santos is and I'm going to tune in. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5443.9400000000005s)]
*  You got to say, lo siento. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5446.42s)]
*  That means sorry in Spanish. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5447.660000000001s)]
*  Lo siento. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5449.26s)]
*  You mean he's always up here. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5450.14s)]
*  Yes. He broadcasts out of Miami. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5451.860000000001s)]
*  So salute to Enrique Santos. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5453.38s)]
*  Yes. Enrique Santos is not the podcaster, I Heart Guy. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5454.5s)]
*  Eddie Garcia, who worked as security at the Intercontinental Hotel, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5458.18s)]
*  is expected to testify, but it's going to be under immunity. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5461.1s)]
*  So he's going to be doing a lot of like not speaking to certain things. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5464.06s)]
*  So I'm. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5468.42s)]
*  What I keep hearing is immunity thing. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5469.22s)]
*  Does that work for the defense? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5470.86s)]
*  Because if you speak for immunity, you know, it's kind of like, OK, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5472.259999999999s)]
*  I can tell if I'm part of it, it doesn't really matter, right? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5475.58s)]
*  The defense has tried to bring up the whole immunity conversation to show [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5478.82s)]
*  reason why people are here and potentially could be saying whatever, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5483.58s)]

*  and they just delivered it this weekend. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5692.82s)]

*  to feed them. And one was a rock star. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5697.66s)]

*  There was poop everywhere. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5712.78s)]
*  That's exactly why my wife won't let me get a dog, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5713.74s)]
*  because she feel like the responsibility is going to end up on her. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5715.66s)]
*  That's what my wife said this morning. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5718.34s)]

*  But I feel like she wasn't gay long enough yet. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5774.3s)]
*  And you know, when you when you become gay, you know, a little late. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5776.3s)]
*  Sometimes people treat it as a trend. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5779.38s)]
*  People treat it as like a phase. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5781.0599999999995s)]

*  But I'm sure they'll have another actor. But Tank definitely killed it. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5835.3s)]
*  I think he was there, what, two, three months? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5837.58s)]
*  I don't remember. I saw him. I went to go see Hell's Kitchen. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5839.18s)]

*  Alicia Keys is dad, allegedly. Yeah. So it's not allegedly. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5847.62s)]
*  I was her dad. Oh, I want to make sure. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5850.98s)]
*  Sometimes it's like in the play, sometimes it's not all actual. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5853.5s)]
*  It's like, I don't know. But he killed it, though. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5859.74s)]

*  What are you talking about? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5864.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, sometimes when I do the plays, they exaggerate certain things at times. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5865.14s)]
*  So I don't know. But in the play, Tank plays Alicia Keys's dad beat daddy. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5868.26s)]

*  I don't know what you talking about. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5872.62s)]
*  Protecting yourself. Just protecting yourself. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5873.9s)]
*  It's a happy world right now. Yes. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5876.38s)]
*  I want Darius to sue me. Call me a deadbeat. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5878.58s)]
*  I don't think that's his real name. I don't know, though. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5882.34s)]
*  See? All right. See? See you, man. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5883.86s)]
*  All right. Well, you got a positive note. I do. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5886.62s)]
*  And my positive note comes from Marcus Aurelius. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5888.9400000000005s)]
*  OK, I love Marcus Aurelius. I like to read about stoicism. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5892.02s)]
*  He says, in your actions, don't procrastinate and your conversations don't confuse. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5895.22s)]
*  And your thoughts don't wander in your soul. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5899.7s)]
*  Don't be passive or aggressive in your life. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5902.14s)]
*  Don't be all about business. Have a good day. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMn8i46KT3k&t=5904.9s)]
