*  Yes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=173.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=174.82s)]
*  So first up on front page, let's get into it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=175.82s)]
*  Former President Biden, Joe Biden has an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=177.38s)]
*  his bones. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=183.06s)]
*  Now, a spokesperson for the former president says the diagnosis came after doctors found [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=184.06s)]
*  a nodule on his prostate on Friday that required further evaluation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=189.06s)]
*  The cancer appears to be hormone sensitive, which allows for effective management. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=193.10000000000002s)]
*  The statement said that the former president and his family are reviewing treatment options. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=197.26s)]
*  Now, Biden has been back in the news of late combating allegations in news reports that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=202.18s)]
*  his mental health has been on the decline. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=206.3s)]
*  His wife, former first lady, Jill Biden, was on the view recently with her husband saying [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=209.1s)]
*  the allegations are false. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=212.7s)]
*  She says she only saw her husband working nonstop. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=214.26s)]
*  Now, former Vice President Kamala Harris, she stepped in and has a reaction in regards [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=216.66s)]
*  to what's going on with President Biden. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=223.12s)]
*  She said that in a post on X that both she and her husband Doug are saddened to learn [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=226.17999999999998s)]
*  of the news calling Biden a fighter who will face this challenge with the same strength, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=229.94s)]
*  resilience and optimism that he has always defined in his life and leadership. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=233.94s)]
*  Former President Obama also shared reactions saying that he and former first lady Michelle [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=240.14s)]
*  are thinking of the entire Biden family and praying for a fast and full recovery. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=245.7s)]
*  Trump also shared well wishes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=250.1s)]
*  He wished former President Biden a fast and successful recovery following his prostate [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=252.42s)]
*  cancer diagnosis. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=256.53999999999996s)]
*  Now, Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Sunday that both him and his wife were [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=257.53999999999996s)]
*  saddened by the news and they extend their warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=261.26s)]
*  Just sad news to hear for former President Biden. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=268.41999999999996s)]
*  Now, the American Cancer Society reports that five-year relative survival rate for men diagnosed [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=271.26s)]
*  with prostate cancer is about 97 percent. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=276.78s)]
*  So with good treatment, he could, you know, be okay for the next few years. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=279.34s)]
*  Now during his administration... [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=284.38s)]
*  He's also an older man. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=285.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=286.38s)]
*  The next few years, what does that look like? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=287.38s)]
*  This is true. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=290.38s)]
*  This is true. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=291.38s)]
*  And of course, during his administration, he launched the Cancer Moonshot Initiative [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=292.38s)]
*  in an effort to cut cancer deaths in half by 2047 in addition to assisting those impacted [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=295.02s)]
*  by cancer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=302.09999999999997s)]
*  So this is pretty much what we know so far in regards to this story, but I will keep [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  you guys posted as more details come available. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  I wonder how often do presidents get physicals because I wonder does it show up before it's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=308.3s)]
*  aggressive or does it just pop up aggressive first? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=313.82s)]
*  You know, a physical isn't going to necessarily, you know, you're not going to necessarily [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  find cancer in a physical. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=321.82s)]
*  That probably takes extensive screening or, you know, further screening, but a physical, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=323.5s)]
*  I believe presidents at least have to have one or two a year. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I just ask because prostate exams are so common. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=330.54s)]
*  Like, you know, I went to go get a physical last week and that's one of the things they [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=332.82s)]
*  did. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  Drew my blood for the prostate exam. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=336.85999999999996s)]
*  As soon as they said prostate exam, I was like, God dang it, I just had one of those [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=338.78s)]
*  last year. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=341.9s)]
*  But they were like, no, we don't have to do that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=342.9s)]
*  Do it that way. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=344.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=345.18s)]
*  They don't have to poke me. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=346.18s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=347.18s)]

*  If and when we win, we're going to be the Pacers. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=528.98s)]
*  We're going to be the Pacers. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=529.98s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=531.4200000000001s)]
*  Okay, you know. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  If and when we win, I want you to wear a Coach Jersey and a Pacer Jersey. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=533.4200000000001s)]
*  Something simple. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=538.4200000000001s)]
*  But if you win, I'm going to donate $1,000 to the charity of your choice. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=539.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm not a betting person, brother. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=543.58s)]
*  I just like to watch the games, but no, I don't really bet like that, brother. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=544.98s)]
*  I'm not a gambling man. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=549.62s)]
*  When I go to the casino, I just go to enjoy. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=550.62s)]
*  I don't even really gamble at the casino, brother. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  So you ain't got no faith in your nicks. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=554.4200000000001s)]
*  But my nicks are going to whack your Pacers, though. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=556.4200000000001s)]
*  I know that much. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=558.4200000000001s)]
*  All right, so I'm super annoyed with some of the men I run across that are blaming Cassie [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=559.86s)]
*  saying that she wanted it and even some of the women. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=564.42s)]
*  I've dated women that have been sexually assaulted. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=566.78s)]
*  I see women that have been sexually assaulted. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=569.42s)]
*  I mentor kids that have been assaulted. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=571.2199999999999s)]
*  They go back. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=573.66s)]
*  This ain't even about the Stockholm syndrome. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=574.66s)]
*  There's something else that I think about when it comes to Cassie. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=576.54s)]
*  Call it the electric complex, where sometimes women actually date the men who they think [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=579.3s)]
*  their father is or want their father to be. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=583.9s)]
*  It's crazy because we're blaming her in its totality. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=586.22s)]
*  She was abused and everybody's ignored it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=590.4200000000001s)]
*  So that's all I got, man. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=592.4200000000001s)]
*  So she ain't take my bet. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=593.4200000000001s)]
*  I didn't want to take it too serious, but I just wanted to mention that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=594.4200000000001s)]

*  DJ Envy is definitely a black man. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=630.62s)]
*  You know how I know? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=633.62s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=634.62s)]
*  Because a guy that would name himself DJ Envy is a real black man. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=635.62s)]
*  He would name himself DJ Envy is a straight-up, light-skinned n******. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=640.82s)]
*  Damn. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=647.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=648.82s)]
*  Like, you know, don't know, you know, you know how you, you come on, you know how I [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=649.82s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=653.82s)]
*  So DJ Envy is a name, you got to see it back in the day, he was the Envy because he was [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=654.82s)]
*  light-skinned. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=659.82s)]

*  All right. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=726.22s)]
*  I want to talk about a little bit of Haitian history that plays into American history. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=727.22s)]
*  Damn, break it down, brother. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=732.22s)]
*  You know, in 1804 Napoleon was forced to sell Louisiana due to the fact that he was fighting [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=733.22s)]
*  the Haitians. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=740.02s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=741.02s)]
*  So America wouldn't have Louisiana if it wasn't for the fact that Haitians fought back and [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=742.02s)]
*  took their freedom in 1804. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=748.3s)]
*  And 9,000 refugees, white and black, fled to Louisiana at that time. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=750.7s)]
*  So a lot of Louisiana natives are also Haitian descendants. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=756.5s)]
*  And what is known is that the U.S. invaded Haiti in 1914 and took $500,000 in gold bars [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=763.1s)]
*  and formed Citigroup due to the fact that we took our freedom. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=773.62s)]
*  The U.S. came and invaded 20 years later, claimed that they lost property, which was [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=779.3s)]
*  the slaves. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=785.0999999999999s)]
*  So we ended up having to pay over $21 billion back to France. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=786.0999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=793.0999999999999s)]
*  And Jean-Pierre Dupont de Thames also founded Chicago. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=794.0999999999999s)]
*  So a lot of people don't know that Haiti has played a lot of integral part in American [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=798.0999999999999s)]
*  history. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=803.6999999999999s)]
*  So I just wanted to let y'all know. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=804.6999999999999s)]
*  Salute to all the Haitians out there. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=805.6999999999999s)]

*  Hello, who's this? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=809.3s)]
*  Yo, this is the Big Homie Ish. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=810.3s)]
*  What's good, Envy? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=811.3s)]
*  What's up, brother? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=812.3s)]
*  Get it off your chest. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=813.3s)]
*  Hey, I want to talk to the brothers out there. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=814.3s)]
*  Man, I was a little concerned last week when I heard brothers calling in, talking about [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=815.3s)]
*  Free Puffy. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=820.3s)]
*  Now, Puffy was out of control from the beginning of his career when he had that incident at [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=821.3s)]
*  City College. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=828.3s)]
*  I'm from BK, so I watched his career from the low to the high. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=829.3s)]
*  But when these guys become these elite individuals, when I say elite become part of that $100 [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=834.3s)]
*  million club, they tend to try to sit on the side where they feel like they're going to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=839.3s)]
*  be accepted by the F-Themes and these individuals that do these outrageous things. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=843.3s)]
*  But when I hear the brothers call in, it was like, yo, why she came up there and why she's [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=848.3s)]
*  speaking her truth? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=854.3s)]
*  That's part of her daring. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=855.3s)]
*  And these same individuals have daughters and wives. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=857.3s)]
*  So this is what you accept for that, your daughter or your wife, that a man will use [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=861.3s)]
*  his money and X, Y, and Z to beat you to the ground. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=865.3s)]
*  And when you speak up about it, it's a problem. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=870.3s)]
*  It just was really disturbing to hear that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=873.3s)]
*  And I was just trying to call in to vent that, man, because I can see it's an ongoing thing [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=875.3s)]
*  within the community where our sisters, they try to lay it down and the brothers not rallying [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=879.3s)]
*  behind them to support them. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=884.3s)]
*  Real talk. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=885.3s)]
*  Well, I think folks need to be screaming for Diddy to get some healing, you know what I'm [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=886.3s)]
*  saying? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=889.3s)]
*  I think he's going to call us to what happens in this situation. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=890.3s)]
*  He's going to have to deal with the consequences of his actions and he cannot run from himself. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=892.3s)]
*  At some point, you got to sit down and do some work on yourself because he clearly needs [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=896.3s)]
*  it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=900.3s)]
*  Most definitely. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=901.3s)]
*  But for Diddy, I just feel like it's been so long throughout his career where it should [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=902.3s)]
*  have been some sort of change. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=908.3s)]
*  You know, I'm not just, it's before Cassie, it's all the other little things that was [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKPTnAAagUs&t=910.3s)]
