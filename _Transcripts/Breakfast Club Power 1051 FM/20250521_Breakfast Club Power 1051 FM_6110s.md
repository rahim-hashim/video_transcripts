*  That was love in that room. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=223.32s)]
*  There was no shouting. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=224.32s)]
*  shouting that I think it was a meeting of love. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=225.32s)]
*  There were a couple of things that we talked about specifically, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=228.32s)]
*  where some people felt a little bit one way or the other, not a big deal. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=231.0s)]
*  And I covered them and wasn't so much a speech, I covered certain points. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=234.48s)]
*  So we're gonna cut drug prices by from 75 to 85, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  in some cases even more than that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=242.68s)]
*  So Trump added there were a few concerns he helped clear up and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  thinks the legislation will move forward. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=249.28s)]
*  Now the bill cleared the GOP led committee in the house on Sunday. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=251.12s)]
*  I also attended a press conference for or of sorts for GOP leaders. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=256.0s)]
*  And here's what my house speaker Mike Johnson had to say about the legislation, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=260.6s)]
*  the big beautiful bill. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=264.68s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Mike Johnson. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=265.48s)]
*  This is really simple. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=267.76s)]
*  We're delivering, we're doing what we said we were gonna do. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=268.6s)]
*  When you talk about putting Americans first, we're making the largest investment [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=271.16s)]
*  in border security and over generation, providing nearly $150 billion to secure [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=273.92s)]
*  our border and deport illegal aliens. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=278.92s)]
*  We are cracking down on illegal aliens receiving Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=281.12s)]
*  tax benefits that are intended for the citizens of this country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  We're shifting the cost of adjudication in the immigration system from the American [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=289.48s)]
*  taxpayer to the aliens themselves. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=293.32s)]
*  So he went on to say that those cuts that we're hearing about in Medicaid and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=296.48s)]
*  Medicare and SNAP, they're directly supposed to be impacting those [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=301.52s)]
*  immigrants or migrants who supposedly should not be receiving those. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=307.6s)]
*  So Speaker Johnson and other GOP leaders, they also refuse to take questions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=312.0s)]
*  That's why I said it was a press conference of sorts. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=315.36s)]
*  But despite being rules that there are in place that they are supposed to take [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=320.96s)]
*  questions from reporters. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=324.08s)]
*  So this adds to your case CTG that we may be in that post constitutional society [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=325.0s)]
*  where our very own government is breaking its own rules when it's convenient for [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=329.64s)]
*  them while also calling out and claiming those who are breaking rules on the other side. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's obvious. What about infrastructure for these airports? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=338.36s)]
*  You know, because that's a disaster waiting to happen. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=341.64s)]
*  I saw Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy saying that, you know, the airports [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=343.6s)]
*  just need to overhaul when it comes to infrastructure. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=347.04s)]
*  Is there any of that in the bill? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I believe so. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=352.64s)]
*  Absolutely. Supposedly there is something in the bill regarding infrastructure. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=353.72s)]
*  I will say also no tax on tips is also headed to the House after it passed [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  unanimously in the Senate yesterday. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=363.64s)]
*  Now that bill establishes a new tax deduction for up to twenty five thousand dollars for tips. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=365.28s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, he contends the rules [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=372.28s)]
*  committee, which is scheduled. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=376.56s)]
*  Well, they took up the measure last night. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=378.44s)]
*  They're looking to hide the debate, supposedly hide the debate. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=380.56s)]
*  Let's take a listen to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries comments in regards to this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=384.2s)]
*  so-called big, beautiful bill. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=388.44s)]
*  Republicans know that their efforts to take away health care from millions of Americans [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=390.24s)]
*  is deeply unpopular. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=397.44s)]
*  So, yeah, that pretty much covers that, you guys. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=400.36s)]
*  And we'll see what happens as a result. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  Again, they are going to continue working on getting this through the for the remainder [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=406.12s)]
*  of the week. And they said that they want to have this done by Memorial Day. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=412.16s)]
*  So we will see what happens as a result of that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  Why Hakeem acting like his stepdaddy Chuck Schumer don't support the bill, though? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=419.4s)]
*  You can't just call out Republicans about the bill. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=423.88s)]
*  You got to call out, you know, your stepdaddy Chuck Schumer too, Hakeem. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=426.04s)]
*  OK, Chuck is already bowed down to Trump and agreed to vote for the bill. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=429.16s)]
*  So, all right, we'll clock that T then. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=433.4s)]
*  All right, at seven, we'll talk about the golden dome that Trump wants for our defense [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=435.56s)]
*  here in America. We'll get into that at seven. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=439.92s)]
*  Stick around. All right, everybody else, get it off your chest. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=442.2s)]

*  If you need to vent, phone lines are wide open. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  Again, 800-585-1051. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=449.6s)]

*  oily boy, ditty boy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=483.52s)]
*  Hey, why are we not talking about Harvey Weinstein's retrial going on in New York right now? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=485.08s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein is on retrial. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=489.56s)]
*  I know he was on retrial. Yeah. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=490.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=492.84s)]
*  They're talking about that. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  But you're on retrial right now. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  I ain't know nothing about no retrial, but I know Harvey Weinstein in prison. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, he's getting retried. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=500.71999999999997s)]
*  And then whatever happened, the Epstein files. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=502.04s)]
*  The Epstein files, the Epstein files came out. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=505.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, I mean, whatever happened with all those people that was supposed to get in trouble. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=507.88s)]
*  So we talk about ditty, but the white people get a pass. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=511.36s)]
*  I don't know why we say the white people get a pass when Harvey Weinstein is in prison [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=515.16s)]
*  and Jeffrey Jeffrey Epstein died in jail. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=518.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=520.16s)]
*  And Harvey Weinstein is found guilty. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=520.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't understand when we. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=522.4s)]
*  Yes, sometimes not sometimes, you know, often there's a double standard. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=524.28s)]
*  But in recent years, no. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=528.28s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein is in prison right now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=531.0400000000001s)]
*  You just said he's on retrial and Jeffrey Epstein died in prison. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=532.72s)]
*  Yeah, I do have a question. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=535.88s)]
*  Oh, I got to get off my chest. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=537.4s)]
*  I'd be confused with Uber Eats, right? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=539.0s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=540.6s)]
*  You give a tip, then you got to pay a delivery fee. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=541.52s)]
*  Yeah. And then a service fee. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=545.6s)]
*  So you get a delivery fee. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=546.88s)]
*  Ain't that a tip? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=548.76s)]

*  And then you want a tip. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  Hey, that was a hard left, bro. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=552.24s)]

*  I had to take home a home loan to pay that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1213.6799999999998s)]
*  Straight. Because you had the money. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1215.6399999999999s)]
*  You didn't need the money. You did it because you just wanted to make me do it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1217.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to try to bury you. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1220.28s)]
*  If not, try to hurt you myself. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1222.24s)]

*  Hurt you hurt you myself. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  Her mom then talked about another incident where they flew into L.A. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1227.1599999999999s)]
*  for Cassie's 30th birthday. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1231.32s)]
*  And this was Cassie's birthday in August. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1232.9199999999998s)]
*  So she was like, it's August. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1235.04s)]
*  We find L.A. Cassie's birthday. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1235.92s)]
*  It's our 30th. So, you know, they're excited. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1238.04s)]
*  That's that's their baby. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1239.48s)]
*  They get there in Diddy and Cassie allegedly already going through their things. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1240.96s)]
*  And there's an incident that goes down where Diddy takes Cassie's phone, allegedly. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1245.0800000000002s)]
*  And her mom, she Cassie tells her mom and her mom is trying to get the phone back. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1249.72s)]
*  So they're outside of Cassie's apartment. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1254.3200000000002s)]
*  Cassie's mother, Diddy and allegedly D Rock [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1256.8000000000002s)]
*  arguing Cassie's mom said, oh, I was yelling at him. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1260.3200000000002s)]
*  I was trying to hit him. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1262.8000000000002s)]
*  The only reason she alleged she couldn't get to him is because D Rock was in the middle of them. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1263.84s)]
*  So now you have this older woman outside trying to fight you to get her baby's phone back. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1267.04s)]
*  Allegedly, right. D Rock's in the middle. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1270.6s)]
*  He she said Diddy Cassie's mom says that Diddy did not give the phone back. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1272.56s)]
*  But I mean, I'm sorry, he did give the phone back. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1277.32s)]
*  But when he left, he left with Cassie's car, allegedly. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1279.8799999999999s)]
*  It was a Jaguar car that he left with. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1283.0s)]
*  And prosecutors like, well, how did you know that he left with the car? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1285.6399999999999s)]
*  She said, I saw it drive off. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1288.1599999999999s)]
*  So then that goes back to a lot of what Cassie was saying. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1289.56s)]
*  Originally, like he controlled everything. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1292.48s)]
*  He would take things when he got upset. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1294.48s)]
*  Allegedly, he would do different things. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1295.8s)]
*  So she kind of had to do her job as she kept mentioning. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1297.16s)]
*  What about Kid Cudi? I heard Kid Cudi taking a stand. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1301.36s)]
*  Kid Cudi is taking a stand. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1303.32s)]
*  I want to say before we get to Kid Cudi, this Cassie's mother was the first witness [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1304.32s)]
*  that Diddy's team did not cross. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1307.64s)]
*  They didn't ask for no questions. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1310.32s)]
*  The lawyer stood up, introduced himself and said, I have no questions for you. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1311.4s)]
*  That was the first time we ever seen that in court. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1314.04s)]
*  Because what you going to say to that woman? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1315.72s)]
*  Nothing. Exactly. Now, Kid Cudi. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1317.04s)]
*  Yes. So you understand yesterday at the end, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1319.04s)]
*  they started to talk about the rest of the week and they said that Kid Cudi [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1321.88s)]
*  will be in court this week. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1324.44s)]
*  They said that today, Wednesday, if they were able to, they would get to Kid Cudi [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1325.88s)]
*  and he would be testifying. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1330.88s)]
*  But from what I'm told, the testimonies are going to be set up today. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1332.2s)]
*  They don't really think that they'll get to him today. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1335.2s)]
*  That is actually supposed to be Thursday, which is going to be a [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1336.68s)]
*  he's a huge witness as well, too, because he's going to speak to, of course, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1340.8400000000001s)]
*  a lot of the the arson, but the arson, the card stuff. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1343.48s)]
*  But also the conversation that they had at that dinner. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1346.4s)]
*  That alleged conversation, the alleged conversation they had at that restaurant. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1348.0s)]
*  And they is Cassie, Diddy and Kid Cudi, because Cassie alleged that Diddy came [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1351.52s)]
*  and sat them all down and said, I don't like what's going on here, basically. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1357.44s)]
*  And what's happening? Fill me in. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1360.96s)]
*  Because he felt the way Diddy Seam is alleging that Diddy, he did that [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1363.56s)]
*  because he felt the way because he put them in the studio together. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1366.56s)]
*  And then they started dating. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1368.8s)]
*  Cassie's like, regardless of the situation, it was it was threatening. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1370.0s)]
*  And he mentioned that he was going to do things allegedly to Kid Cudi into her. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1373.16s)]
*  The car came into conversation. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1377.04s)]
*  And at that dinner, Cassie alleges that Kid Cudi said to Diddy, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1378.48s)]
*  well, what about my car? And Diddy said, what car are you talking about? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1382.6s)]
*  Yeah, but people who don't know, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1385.24s)]
*  Diddy allegedly blew his car up. Yes. Oh, sorry. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1387.28s)]
*  I forgot. That's a major point to say. Yes. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1389.44s)]
*  Yeah, because he allegedly blew his car up. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1391.16s)]
*  So my car. Jesus. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1392.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be big, man, because, you know, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1394.56s)]
*  Diddy allegedly threatened to kill him, went to his house with a loaded gun. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1398.24s)]
*  And that's going to be a really interesting part of the trial, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1400.68s)]
*  because it'll probably start with with Cudi. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1402.6s)]
*  And then there'll be another witness who used to work for Diddy. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1404.84s)]
*  He'll probably come in and confirm a lot of Cudi's testimony. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1407.2s)]
*  Now, what about Big Punisher that his penis couldn't get hard and he had to? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1411.1200000000001s)]
*  First of all, first of all, you need to watch how you say that, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1413.68s)]
*  because people won't think you're talking about the rapper. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1416.68s)]
*  Oh, there's a rapper named Big Punisher? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1419.16s)]
*  Yes. He passed away. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1420.64s)]
*  Big Punisher. Big Pun passed away 30 years ago. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1421.64s)]
*  And Diddy been freaking off for 30 years. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1424.48s)]
*  I didn't know that Big Pun's full name was Big Punisher. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1426.48s)]
*  Exactly. I never knew that. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1428.6000000000001s)]
*  But no, his name is The Punisher. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1429.88s)]
*  His actual name is, let me look it up, it's like Shereya, Shereh Hayes. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1432.56s)]

*  Or just no, he leans into freezer and meat because he said, you know, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1452.88s)]

*  And the book is about mental health and how erectile dysfunction [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1458.24s)]
*  can play into your mental health. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1463.3600000000001s)]

*  It's DJ Envy, Jess Hilarious, Charlamagne Nega. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1545.56s)]
*  We are The Breakfast Club. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1548.8s)]
*  Let's get in some front page news. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1549.96s)]
*  Start with the NBA playoffs last night. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1552.24s)]
*  OKC beat the Timberwolves 114 to 88. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1553.88s)]
*  They lead the series 1-0. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1556.8s)]
*  The Knicks play tonight at 8 p.m. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1558.56s)]
*  All right. What's up, Morgan? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1561.0s)]
*  All right. Let's get back into it. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1563.04s)]
*  So President Trump wants the U.S. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1564.52s)]
*  to have a golden dome defense system up and running in about three years. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1566.0s)]
*  This would be similar to Israel's Iron Dome, which is an all weather [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1570.08s)]
*  air defense system that intercepts and destroys short range missiles [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1573.68s)]
*  and artillery shells. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1577.84s)]
*  Now, he outlined his plans for the missile defense system in an announcement [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1579.44s)]
*  from the Oval Office at the White House, alongside Defense Secretary [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1583.0400000000002s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, saying Canada also wants to be involved and the system [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1586.2800000000002s)]
*  will provide great protection. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1590.44s)]
*  Let's take a listen to President Trump's comments. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1592.0800000000002s)]
*  Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1594.44s)]
*  even if they are launched from other sides of the world [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1599.3200000000002s)]
*  and even if they are launched from space. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1602.92s)]
*  Canada has called us and they want to be a part of it. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1605.16s)]
*  So we'll be talking to them. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1608.08s)]
*  They want to have protection also. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1609.3999999999999s)]
*  So as usual, we help Canada do the best we can. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1612.1999999999998s)]
*  So the Golden Dome is the president's vision for a cutting edge missile shield [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1615.84s)]
*  that can protect the U.S. from long range strikes. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1619.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, Trump said the final price tag for the system will be about one hundred [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1622.32s)]
*  seventy five billion dollars. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1625.8799999999999s)]
*  The president is appointing Space Force General Michael Gutland [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1627.8799999999999s)]
*  to lead the project. Now, Space News reports that estimated cost [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1631.52s)]
*  around one hundred seventy five billion, while a twenty five billion dollar [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1634.56s)]
*  down payment is included in that Republican reconciliation spending bill. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1638.36s)]
*  You know, that big, beautiful bill that we keep talking about. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1642.32s)]
*  So there's a twenty five billion dollar down payment included [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1644.28s)]
*  for this project in that bill. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1647.68s)]
*  And it also remains unclear how the project will be fully funded [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1649.96s)]
*  and whether or not it will actually pass Congress. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1653.92s)]
*  That big, beautiful bill. Now, Reuters report reports [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1656.72s)]
*  the U.S. government is exploring different ways to finance the project, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1659.44s)]
*  including potentially through a subscription service model. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1663.28s)]
*  So I keep you guys posted on what is projected to happen [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1667.28s)]
*  with our Golden Dome here in the U.S. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1671.72s)]
*  That doesn't sound too bad to me. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1675.32s)]
*  I mean, Israel has it and it protects them from from any type of missiles [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1676.6s)]
*  or explosions, anything. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1680.04s)]
*  So I feel like we should have had that already. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1681.8799999999999s)]
*  As I always say, if you can tell people how you're going to put some money [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1684.0s)]
*  in their pocket and keep them safe, they're going to always be on board. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1687.56s)]
*  So, you know, you talk about something that's going to keep American people safe. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1690.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't think you're going to get too many push, too much push back on that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1693.3999999999999s)]
*  Not at all. All right. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1695.84s)]
*  As we approach the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1697.84s)]
*  there's been some conversation around pardoning former Minneapolis [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1700.8s)]
*  police officer Derek Chauvin. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1704.08s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk reposted a podcaster suggesting the pardon, saying [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1705.76s)]
*  it's something to think about. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1710.2s)]
*  Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara says he heard nothing [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1711.84s)]
*  to suggest that President Trump plans to pardon officer, former officer [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1715.52s)]
*  Derek Chauvin, who's in prison for the Memorial Day 2020 murder of George Floyd. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1719.28s)]
*  Now, O'Hara told a news conference on Monday that the topic came up [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1724.68s)]
*  when he was in Washington, D.C. recently. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1728.3600000000001s)]
*  He also said preparations for the possibility of civil unrest. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1730.76s)]
*  Should it be misunderstood? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1734.1200000000001s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1735.88s)]
*  I've literally had police chiefs from around the country [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1737.72s)]
*  ask me that question, and I'll tell you what I've told them. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1740.1200000000001s)]
*  There is absolutely no credible information we have [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1743.56s)]
*  to suggest that's going to happen. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1747.9199999999998s)]
*  We've been in communication [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1749.7199999999998s)]
*  with our partners at the state, at the federal level, to ensure that we [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1751.6399999999999s)]
*  and all of our partners are prepared in the event that something like that [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1755.76s)]
*  happens and it causes some type of civil disturbance. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1760.1599999999999s)]
*  Pardon Derek Chauvin, then it'll be civil unrest and then they'll [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1763.8799999999999s)]
*  unleash martial law. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1767.1999999999998s)]
*  You know, don't fall for that okie doke. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1768.84s)]
*  By the way, I don't think that this is something that they're really considering. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1770.3999999999999s)]
*  I think that this is Elon Musk's way of trolling. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1772.8799999999999s)]
*  I think this is a lot of people on social media's way of trolling. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1775.76s)]
*  They know that it's going to cause chaos and cause people to be up in arms. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1778.32s)]
*  When they see that, I don't think that that's something they'll ever do. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1781.8s)]
*  I don't put anything past this administration, but I don't think that's something they'll ever do. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1784.52s)]
*  Well, everyone saw the video and even at the time, President Trump, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1788.0s)]
*  you know, he mentioned that that was wrong. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1791.56s)]
*  I mean, everyone saw that that was wrong. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1793.36s)]
*  So Floyd, of course, was killed after Chauvin and one of several [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1795.2s)]
*  officers on the scene that day. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1798.8799999999999s)]
*  He knelt on his neck and back while trying to arrest him on suspicion [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1800.64s)]
*  of using a counterfeit twenty dollar bill. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1803.96s)]
*  And while we're on the topic of George Floyd, George Floyd, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1807.6000000000001s)]
*  yes, say his name, say his name. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1810.4s)]
*  While we're on the topic of George Floyd, the National Urban League [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1812.4s)]
*  released its latest report titled George Floyd five years later. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1814.88s)]
*  Was it a moment or a movement? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1818.68s)]
*  Now, National Urban League president and CEO Mark Marie, I was in Washington, D.C. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1821.08s)]
*  recently for the organization's legislative conference, saying the report [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1825.3600000000001s)]
*  explains the analysis of wins, setbacks and the work that still needs to be done [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1829.08s)]
*  to combat systemic racism and deep rooted inequities. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1833.44s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Mark Morial from the National Urban League. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1837.0s)]
*  When it comes to police reform and public safety, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1841.0800000000002s)]
*  many states, many cities, police departments, the Justice Department [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1846.3200000000002s)]
*  advocates advocated long and hard for meaningful change. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1851.44s)]
*  But that change is incomplete and not permanent. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1856.28s)]
*  It's now the forces seem to turn it back. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1861.1200000000001s)]
*  So Morial urged people to get involved with civil rights organizations [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1863.44s)]
*  and to hold their elected officials accountable from everything, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1867.6000000000001s)]
*  from the local level to the federal level. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1871.28s)]
*  And of course, he went on to say that this right now is not the time to be scared, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1873.3600000000001s)]
*  but to pretty much pull up your bootstraps. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1878.24s)]
*  And I'll take it a step further and quote the late, great Congressman John Lewis. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1879.76s)]
*  I like to say, get in good trouble, necessary trouble and restore the soul of America. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1883.44s)]
*  Yeah, I would say that it was a moment, you know, me, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1887.8400000000001s)]
*  because one of the biggest things that come out of that moment [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1889.92s)]
*  was all the pledges that corporate America made. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1891.96s)]
*  I remember corporate America said they were going to make 50 billion dollars, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1894.04s)]
*  you know, pledge 50 billion dollars to racial inequality. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1897.32s)]
*  They didn't. You know what I mean? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1900.2s)]
*  They didn't. And a lot of those D.I. initiatives have, you know, been rolled back, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1902.16s)]
*  you know, since the Trump administration has been in. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1906.16s)]
*  So I would say it was just a moment. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1908.48s)]
*  It was it wasn't a movement. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1910.3600000000001s)]
*  It could have been a movement if that those pledges would have been honored. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1912.28s)]
*  But no, it was a moment. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1916.0s)]
*  What do you think it takes to make a movement, to actually truly unite people [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1917.3600000000001s)]
*  and actually have a movement? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1920.64s)]
*  I mean, MAGA seems like a movement, or at least that's what Marc Morial said. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1921.88s)]
*  He said MAGA is in fact a movement. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1924.96s)]
*  MAGA is a movement because they got actual wins. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1927.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, Trump is back in the White House. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1929.64s)]
*  Project 2025 is being implemented. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1931.5200000000002s)]
*  So these things that they actually, you know, promise to people, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1933.64s)]
*  they're actually in office in doing. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1936.6000000000001s)]
*  Like I said, it would have been a movement if those corporations. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1939.0800000000002s)]
*  And this is just my personal opinion. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1942.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm not, you know, I'm not the end all be all on this. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1943.92s)]
*  But if those if those corporations had actually pledged that 50 billion dollars, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1946.0s)]
*  you know, two different initiatives to, you know, help to stop racial inequality, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1950.24s)]
*  I think that would have made it a movement, my personal opinion. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1955.56s)]
*  But the fact that they didn't and the initiatives got rolled back. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1959.0s)]
*  No, no. Just the moment then. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1962.36s)]
*  All right. So that's your front page news, y'all. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=1964.8s)]

*  We got a special guest in the building. The champ is here. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2000.48s)]
*  Yes, indeed. Clarissa Shields. Welcome. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2003.4s)]
*  How you feeling? I feel good. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2006.0s)]
*  I'm happy to be here. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2008.0s)]
*  How you feeling? You got to fight July 26. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2009.24s)]
*  Yes. Little Caesars Arena in Detroit against Lainey Daniels. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2011.52s)]
*  Yeah. Always excited to fight a girl, man. Always excited. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2014.76s)]
*  She's facing some more world championships. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2017.28s)]
*  She got two belts. OK. She's from New Zealand. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2018.92s)]
*  She's supposed to be tough. So I look forward to fighting her. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2021.2s)]
*  How do y'all pick the fights? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2024.08s)]
*  Like who helps you decide who your next opponent is going to be? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2025.0s)]
*  We just go whoever the best is. OK. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2027.56s)]
*  And then if the best turns down, we go to second best. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2029.28s)]
*  And then if second best, we go third best. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2031.28s)]
*  This fight, we went for Hannah Gabriel. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2033.08s)]
*  So you know, that dropped me in Detroit a couple of years back. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2034.8s)]
*  I wanted to rematch her and she turned this down. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2037.48s)]
*  A lot of people turned you down. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2041.0s)]
*  Is it hard for you to fight an opponent? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2042.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, I'm champ at five different weight classes. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2044.04s)]
*  So when I was at 154 and 160 and 168, now I'm at 175. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2046.6s)]
*  And when I was at 154, these girls who are fighting at 154 now wouldn't [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2051.16s)]
*  wouldn't fight me. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2055.2s)]
*  You know, I literally had to go up. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2056.16s)]
*  It was like, OK, I challenged the girls who was at 147, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2058.16s)]
*  but they didn't want to fight. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2061.48s)]
*  I initially went down because I wanted to fight against the 147 champions [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2062.72s)]
*  until you're broken at the time. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2066.0s)]
*  And she told me that I was too fat to get down to 54. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2067.6s)]
*  So when I got to 54 and beat up all the girls at 54, I said, now is your time. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2070.16s)]
*  And she said, I'm not. She said she wasn't fighting me. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2074.16s)]
*  So I was like, well, damn, that was a waste of time coming down to 154 [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2076.2s)]
*  because I barely made that weight. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2079.4s)]
*  It's clear. Are you scared to lose? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2081.8s)]
*  You guys can't beat me. What? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2083.56s)]
*  What? I'm scared of. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2084.52s)]
*  Absolutely. Come on now. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2086.68s)]
*  I know, but I just know a lot of fighters be wanting that perfect record. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2087.84s)]
*  And when they if they do lose, they don't bounce back the same sometime. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2091.04s)]
*  I don't know them about them, but I know me. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2094.56s)]
*  I think I trained too hard and I'm too gifted and I'm just mean in there. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2097.48s)]
*  I mean, you know what it is. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2101.44s)]
*  Like, I'm just I'm just real mean. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2103.0s)]
*  I'm real dominant. I'm very confident. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2104.7599999999998s)]
*  And I know that I'm very hard to beat. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2106.8399999999997s)]
*  If a girl can beat me, I will get on my knees and kiss her feet [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2109.56s)]
*  and tell her good job. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2112.72s)]
*  That's how I know it's not going to happen. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2114.44s)]
*  So do you study the people that you fight like Lainey Daniels? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2115.72s)]
*  Have you like gone down a rabbit hole of her highlights and stuff like that? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2119.68s)]
*  It doesn't take me long to watch the highlights. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2122.8799999999997s)]
*  I watch the highlights and I watch a girl fight and I say, OK, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2125.12s)]
*  I know what I need to do with her. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2128.24s)]
*  It doesn't take me long to watch it. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2129.2799999999997s)]
*  But I do other research. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2131.0s)]
*  You know, I go and watch interviews of her just talking. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2132.52s)]
*  I go and look at news articles. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2135.6s)]
*  I learn about her life. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2137.8399999999997s)]
*  What was her childhood like, you know, what she's been through in life? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2139.7999999999997s)]
*  Like I go and do like deeper. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2143.04s)]
*  Like study deeper than just fighting. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2144.48s)]
*  What does that do for you in the ring? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2146.6s)]
*  Like, how does that the trash talk? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2148.24s)]
*  You know, you got to get in the head. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2150.9599999999996s)]
*  You know, some of these girls, you want to piss them off. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2152.04s)]
*  They be having a good game plan. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2154.4s)]
*  But once you piss them off, the game plan got the window. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2155.96s)]
*  Like they just want to kill you. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2158.0s)]
*  And I think that's what I did with Savannah Marshall. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2159.56s)]
*  Like I went and did my research on her. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2161.2s)]
*  And then I start talking to her. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2163.2799999999997s)]
*  And then when we got face to face and whenever I seen her, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2165.16s)]
*  I just used to say stuff to her. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2168.44s)]
*  And I know that what I would say will play over and over again in her head. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2169.8s)]
*  And then when we fought her culture and her game plan was to stand in the center [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2173.8s)]
*  of the ring and fight me, which was like, that's dumb. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2177.44s)]
*  You six, two, five, nine. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2179.6s)]
*  You should have been on your job, at least to give you a better chance. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2181.88s)]
*  That winning. But she came out there trying to, you know, fight like she can [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2184.56s)]
*  knock me out and almost got her ass knocked out. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2187.08s)]
*  I wanted to go back a little bit. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2190.12s)]
*  Last time you came here, you were promoting your movie. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2192.0s)]
*  Yes. And we didn't get it. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2194.44s)]
*  None of us got a chance to see the movie because we didn't come out yet. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2196.2400000000002s)]
*  And I've seen the movie. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2198.48s)]
*  And I wanted to talk about that. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2199.44s)]
*  Your childhood growing up a little bit, because we didn't discuss it last time [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2200.48s)]
*  because we didn't see the movie. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2202.96s)]
*  So after being a champion that young for that long, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2204.4s)]
*  nobody gave you endorsement deals. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2209.1600000000003s)]
*  Nobody put you on the cover of those serial companies. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2211.44s)]
*  There was no money coming in. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2215.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm sitting there like, this is crazy because you are a champ. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2216.8s)]
*  And how did that happen? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2220.36s)]
*  And how did you not hate the sport of boxing and say, F this? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2221.32s)]
*  Because you weren't even like the fact that you're winning [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2224.0400000000004s)]
*  and you still have to go back to Michigan and still have to go back [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2226.28s)]
*  to some of the places that you were is crazy. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2228.88s)]
*  Especially when you see a lot of white girls getting all that money. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2231.76s)]
*  Honestly, I feel like back then, me being 17 years old, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2234.4s)]
*  me being from Flint, Michigan, I was rough around the edges. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2238.24s)]
*  You know, I'm more put together now. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2241.24s)]
*  And I can say that back then, I didn't understand what the branding part of it was. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2243.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, how they want you to talk. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2247.72s)]
*  You seen in the movie, you know, how they want you to wear your hair, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2250.2799999999997s)]
*  how they want you to dress or how you supposed to dress. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2253.12s)]
*  Like, what's the ideal American golden girl? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2255.7999999999997s)]
*  For me, it was all about the accolades. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2259.24s)]
*  It was like, yeah, you can have the makeup and the hair and look good. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2260.8799999999997s)]
*  But if you can do all that and then you don't win the fights, then who cares? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2263.9199999999996s)]
*  To me, winning has always been the number one thing to do. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2266.96s)]
*  That had a part to play in it. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2270.12s)]
*  And then also women's boxing being fairly new. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2271.8s)]
*  There is no way possible to make women's boxing look good. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2274.92s)]
*  Now, I know I make it look good now, but that's when I'm outside the ring. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2277.92s)]
*  Inside the ring, you get what you get. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2281.52s)]
*  You know, I come there, I have my hair braided. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2283.36s)]
*  Excuse me. I come there in my wig to the actual fight. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2286.12s)]
*  I have my dress on. I have my wig on. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2290.2400000000002s)]
*  I have my makeup on. I go in the back room. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2292.0s)]
*  Once we get to the back after the grand arrival, I'm wiping all the makeup off. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2295.52s)]
*  I mean, wiping the edge control off because edge control sweating again, your eyes. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2299.4s)]
*  And then I'll be taking the knee like, you know, I'm trying to say [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2303.6800000000003s)]
*  that don't work, though, that that's not how it works. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2307.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, you're not saying he didn't have edge control. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2309.5600000000004s)]
*  He said it was grease. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2311.32s)]
*  Edge control burn. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2312.92s)]
*  I know from experience, you know, where edge control to the gym. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2314.52s)]
*  So that does happen. Edge control. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2317.48s)]
*  I don't know about no grease now, but edge control. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2319.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes, it starts sweating in your eye. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2321.84s)]
*  It burned like hell. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2323.64s)]
*  So when I when I go in the back, I take everything off to the lashes, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2325.0s)]
*  to everything, the edge control. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2328.36s)]
*  And then I get in the ring and I fight. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2330.64s)]
*  But after the fight is over with, after I don't win ten rounds, sometime less, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2332.16s)]
*  I'd be kind of bruised up and time and sore. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2336.48s)]
*  I still go and put my wig back on. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2338.72s)]
*  That's crazy. I have my girls, my makeup. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2340.8399999999997s)]
*  I put my clothes on, my body suit on, put my heels on. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2343.24s)]
*  And we go out and we party. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2346.2s)]
*  And that is like the balance you have to find. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2347.48s)]
*  But it's not an easy balance to have. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2350.3199999999997s)]
*  Like a lot of times I've been wanting to go home, you know, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2352.48s)]
*  and I've been wanting to lay down and I got to ice my face [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2355.0s)]
*  and my body after fighting for days. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2357.8s)]
*  And then I can come back outside and look refreshed. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2361.0s)]
*  But it's not always that simple. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2362.8s)]
*  So I think it was hard to make back then. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2364.6s)]
*  I didn't care about making boxing be pretty. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2367.72s)]
*  It was like, look, this is what you get. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2369.76s)]
*  You want a female boxer. This is what you get. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2371.56s)]
*  You get muscles. You get grit. You get a hard punch. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2373.64s)]
*  You get me talking to these girls and tell them how bad how bad I'll beat them. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2376.68s)]
*  And like, that's what you get. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2380.2400000000002s)]
*  But now I can manage it better because I think I'm better experienced now. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2381.2s)]
*  I watched the fight inside and I thought to myself, you know, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2385.7999999999997s)]
*  because it shows so much of your personal life. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2388.48s)]
*  What version of Clarissa Shields you think would have emerged without boxing? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2390.64s)]
*  I'd be in jail. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2394.92s)]
*  That's flat out period. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2396.3999999999996s)]
*  And I would say I would be in jail or dead because boxing helped me with my anger. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2397.8399999999997s)]
*  And I'm 30 years old and I still deal with my anger now. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2402.7999999999997s)]
*  But back then, I was I was way meaner. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2405.6s)]
*  I didn't have an understanding of why I had to go through things that I went [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2408.6s)]
*  through, why my upbringing was so tough. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2411.48s)]
*  And I was angry about that. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2414.04s)]
*  Boxing helped me relieve some of that anger. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2415.68s)]
*  It helped me directed towards something more positive. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2418.12s)]
*  So I know without boxing, I would have been street fighting, fighting girls. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2420.72s)]
*  They used to call me Bishop in my hood because they wanted me to sell drugs. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2425.48s)]
*  Because I was the one I go to. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2429.72s)]
*  I can I. Hey, he said, give him this and then run it back. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2431.16s)]
*  But it was just like for me, I was like, I don't. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2434.7999999999997s)]
*  I didn't want that type of lifestyle, you know what I'm saying? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2436.92s)]
*  But I know without boxing, that would have happened. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2439.2400000000002s)]
*  Some people like, oh, you would. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2441.56s)]
*  Oh, you would have been pregnant. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2443.2400000000002s)]
*  But I didn't even like my first boy till I was 15 years old. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2444.76s)]
*  I didn't like I mean, it's like first books. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2448.48s)]
*  I didn't think it's a girl. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2450.48s)]
*  But I didn't like anything till I was 15. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2451.6400000000003s)]
*  I like boxing. And then when I was 15, I realized that a boy was cute to me. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2454.36s)]
*  And that's why I'm like, OK, so I guess I'm not I'm not gay. Cool. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2458.76s)]
*  You thought she was gay at first? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2462.76s)]
*  Because I didn't like nothing. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2464.36s)]
*  Right. I was weird. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2466.48s)]
*  I think I was gay. I was weird. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2468.44s)]
*  But that's normal. 15. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2470.1600000000003s)]
*  You got that's where your mind should be at. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2471.52s)]
*  You should be thinking about no boys or no girls at 15. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2473.28s)]
*  Yeah, shoot. All my all my friends have boyfriends since 11 to 10 years old. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2475.92s)]
*  You know, where it beats up training, running to the gym, drinking water, eating healthy, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2479.84s)]
*  giving myself a 10 p.m. curfew to be in bed, 6 a.m. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2485.4s)]
*  Get up and go run to school. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2488.1600000000003s)]
*  That was that was my life. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2490.0s)]
*  What happened to you? The coaching trainer. Do you still speak? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2491.44s)]
*  Yeah, me and Jason still speak. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2494.0s)]
*  You know, it was just we too much alike. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2495.2s)]
*  You know, he taught me to be very strong and confident and don't take disrespect. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2498.24s)]
*  And I guess all those who apply except him. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2501.96s)]
*  And I think that was the problem. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2506.04s)]
*  He always told me when like when somebody disrespect you, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2507.68s)]
*  you check and write it in there. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2510.52s)]
*  You don't wait till you go and somewhere quiet or you like somebody disrespect. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2511.64s)]
*  You let him know like right in there like, hey, I don't like that. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2515.9199999999996s)]
*  Like that one cool. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2518.96s)]
*  That was respectful. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2520.0s)]
*  You try to let them know like, hey, it like it's consequences for being disrespectful. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2520.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's consequences. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2525.7599999999998s)]
*  We're still kicking it with the champ Clarissa Shields. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2527.08s)]
*  Jess, right now, what happened exactly with Tosiki? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2529.2799999999997s)]
*  Because I see and Tosiki is from baddies, for those who don't know. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2533.68s)]
*  But that's Krishan's sister. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2538.6s)]
*  But it's so many different rumors around it. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2540.48s)]
*  People say you started and they say she started. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2543.3599999999997s)]
*  I want to know how what even happened because, you know, you're not on baddies. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2545.2799999999997s)]
*  You don't be over there with Zeus. There you go. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2549.68s)]
*  So like, how did that even start? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2551.56s)]
*  Her fans. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2553.6s)]

*  I fight professionally. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2556.04s)]
*  Who's more known for fighting me or Tosiki? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2557.88s)]
*  Let's be professional. You for sure. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2560.88s)]
*  Fighting period. I'm more now. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2563.12s)]
*  I went to the Olympics twice. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2564.4s)]
*  I'm known by millions for fighting. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2565.96s)]
*  But I'm saying you're perfect. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2567.64s)]
*  Like you are a professional fighter. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2568.68s)]
*  Like you say, you're more known professionally. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2570.08s)]
*  So now that she's beating up girls on baddies, her fans came to me. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2572.56s)]
*  Oh, we think Tosiki can do this and do that. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2576.48s)]
*  All I did was respond and let him know. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2579.3199999999997s)]
*  I like that Tosiki is beating these girls up. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2581.12s)]
*  You know, it's good for TV, but she can't beat me up. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2583.68s)]
*  And that's where I think her problem came from. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2586.6s)]
*  But all in all, I don't give a damn about Tosiki or nobody who think [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2589.08s)]
*  that she can do anything with me. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2593.08s)]
*  She said she needs to stop popping pills and all this other shit [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2594.2s)]
*  to get ready to fight me. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2596.92s)]
*  And she got to train exactly how I train. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2597.8399999999997s)]
*  That's she behind the eight ball. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2599.8399999999997s)]
*  She got to do. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2601.3199999999997s)]
*  She's already she's already she's already lost in the sauce [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2602.48s)]
*  when it like comes to even a fight with me. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2605.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's inside the ring and outside the ring. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2607.2799999999997s)]
*  I want to see it. I don't I'm not wishing that on you, Clarissa, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2609.2s)]
*  but I just want to see it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2611.72s)]
*  Like when I hear people just randomly talking to professional athletes online, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2612.84s)]
*  like they can just beat them so easily. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2616.6400000000003s)]
*  I just want to I need to see I'm serious. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2618.84s)]
*  I don't know why we need to see the difference between a Clarissa [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2621.76s)]
*  Shields and just you, you know, fighting in the backyard. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2624.96s)]
*  Yeah. What do you mean? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2628.56s)]
*  You want to see me in a street fight? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2629.56s)]
*  Now, I want you to get some money for it. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2630.8s)]
*  But I just want to know, I'm saying like you want to see me [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2632.1200000000003s)]
*  like fight without gloves. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2633.56s)]
*  Yeah, because you're waiting. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2634.7200000000003s)]
*  We must hate you. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2635.84s)]
*  Either way, you win. Right. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2637.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, yeah. No, no. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2638.44s)]
*  I will. I will say with boxing. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2640.32s)]
*  Listen, first of all, the boxing gloves protect the fighters. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2641.88s)]
*  It's the padding. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2645.4s)]
*  I would never do bare knuckle boxing. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2646.44s)]
*  I barely wanted to do MMA, which is four ounce gloves. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2648.44s)]
*  But Charlamagne, I fight these girls with no gloves on. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2651.08s)]
*  You must hate them. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2653.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2654.88s)]
*  I can't believe you said that. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2657.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. He said that. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2659.6s)]
*  I apologize for him. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2661.52s)]
*  But didn't they they try to get you on baddies. Right. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2662.8s)]
*  Natalie wanted me to come. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2666.32s)]
*  Natalie wanted you to come to stay in the house and everything. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2667.44s)]
*  And I told her, listen, I was all for it because I feel like it's cross [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2670.0s)]
*  branding. Yeah, it's cross branding. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2673.4s)]
*  And I will more go on there on some. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2675.16s)]
*  I like positive stuff. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2677.72s)]
*  You know, I like really. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2679.44s)]
*  Yeah, I like I like this stuff. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2681.36s)]
*  OK, like boxing is positive to me. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2682.96s)]
*  But I will go on there more of like I think the girls on on baddies. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2685.28s)]
*  It's a lot of women on there who got like some trauma and these healing, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2689.6s)]
*  you know, and training and boxing helped me. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2693.0s)]
*  I want to go on there to these girls want to fight all the time. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2696.08s)]
*  I don't understand if they fight in the if they fight the whole time. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2699.24s)]
*  Who's getting to a bag? Yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2702.3199999999997s)]
*  That that'd be my question for them. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2704.6s)]
*  I was actually getting to some money on there. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2706.4799999999996s)]
*  If all they doing is fighting, they can't go to the club. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2708.9199999999996s)]
*  They can't go to dinner. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2711.2799999999997s)]
*  They can't go to events because it's a fight that break out every time. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2712.08s)]
*  So for me, I was like, look, I will go on there. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2715.9199999999996s)]
*  And I want to be that eye opener. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2718.08s)]
*  Like, look, let's train, let's work out, let's relieve some stress. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2719.9599999999996s)]
*  And maybe everything can go more smoothly. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2723.2799999999997s)]
*  But then, of course, if it can't get a glove up and put on headgear [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2725.3999999999996s)]
*  and some mouthpieces because girls getting their teeth knocked out, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2729.0s)]
*  they can get eyes busted up for nothing. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2732.56s)]
*  I don't know how much they know. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2735.56s)]
*  I'm not even talking about like what they can pay. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2736.76s)]
*  But I'm just saying like for no is nothing. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2739.08s)]
*  It's just a bunch of arguments and fighting. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2741.08s)]
*  Yeah. No objective, no true objective. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2743.68s)]
*  Yeah. You don't know who's right, who's wrong. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2745.84s)]
*  I don't know. But like I said, I told Natalie that I will come on her show. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2747.72s)]
*  But she's got to have everybody sign a sign a form that if I listen, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2751.44s)]
*  I want them girls trying to be so intimidated, they team up [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2755.92s)]
*  and try to jump me. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2758.88s)]
*  And I got the whoop for one day and then lost it to come after that. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2759.96s)]
*  And then, you know, we got to we got to have them sign that. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2763.44s)]
*  Listen, I'm not responsible for no damages, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2766.56s)]
*  for no teeth, no eyes, none of that. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2769.4s)]
*  And they sign it. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2771.6400000000003s)]
*  No, she said she couldn't get it done. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2773.28s)]
*  She said, oh, she talked to Zeus in and since it's reality TV, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2774.96s)]
*  she can't have them sign it. I said, well, I can't come. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2778.56s)]
*  And we didn't talk about money or anything, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2781.04s)]
*  because once we didn't get past that, I just said, OK, cool. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2783.44s)]
*  And people be so scared to take a ass with it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2786.44s)]
*  They might come at you with weapons and all types of people trying to [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2788.16s)]
*  people talk about, listen, I don't people [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2791.3199999999997s)]
*  said that they're going to shoot me, stab me, all types of stuff. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2793.2799999999997s)]
*  I want to ask about, you know, the last fight, they said at first, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2795.72s)]
*  they said there was some substance in your urine. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2798.8799999999997s)]
*  And then they came back and said that wasn't true. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2800.68s)]
*  What happened with that instance? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2802.2s)]
*  Man, people was crazy. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2803.44s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2805.44s)]
*  Like it was it's just it's just crazy work. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2806.48s)]
*  I will I will tell you that I've never experienced something like that in my life. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2809.12s)]
*  I don't smoke marijuana. I don't eat marijuana. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2812.6s)]
*  I'm not even around people that smoke. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2815.3199999999997s)]
*  I was thinking that it was the arena, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2817.16s)]
*  because I know in the arena was smoky as ever. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2819.68s)]
*  You know, rather that was with cigarette smoke, weed, smoke, whatever. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2822.3599999999997s)]
*  Because it's legal in Michigan. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2825.68s)]
*  It's very legal. You can just go to Storm Byatt. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2826.8799999999997s)]
*  When I found out that it was in my system, first thing I did, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2830.04s)]
*  because I was here in New Jersey and I was with PEP. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2832.7999999999997s)]
*  When I got the news, I went straight to LabCorp and I took a urine test. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2835.7599999999998s)]
*  And that and that goes back to 30 days. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2839.7599999999998s)]
*  And it said I didn't have any marijuana in my system at all. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2841.8799999999997s)]
*  So how this came out that I did have it in there? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2845.0s)]
*  From a swab test, which isn't really that accurate versus a urine test. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2847.16s)]
*  I think that's how I beat my case. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2850.92s)]
*  Like I said, I had to go and sit in front of them and go to trial and all this [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2852.64s)]
*  bullcrap, but I think something was wrong with their tests. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2856.72s)]
*  I don't know what was wrong with the test, but everything got resolved. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2859.7999999999997s)]
*  I got unsuspended. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2863.24s)]
*  And now we back fight in July 26 at Little Caesar's in Detroit. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2864.6s)]
*  You know, you said earlier that, you know, people do you to clout now. Right. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2868.16s)]
*  And I saw I saw Chris Cyborg just tweet out. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2871.44s)]
*  He said, who is that? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2874.24s)]
*  The UFC fighter. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2875.64s)]
*  OK, he said only five boxing fights, but already got more KOs than Clarissa Shield. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2876.7999999999997s)]
*  That was so random. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2881.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why she first of all, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2883.04s)]
*  I kicked Chris Cyborg ass very bad when we sparred a few years back. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2886.96s)]
*  And I know now I was the fighter. I'll knock her out. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2891.2s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2893.44s)]
*  And then she just fought a girl that was four, four wins, three losses [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2894.68s)]
*  and had been knocked out twice already. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2898.36s)]
*  So if you go out, if you want to be technical, this I have to. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2899.7599999999998s)]
*  If you go to box, I've never fought against a fighter who wasn't [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2903.92s)]
*  who had more than four or five losses. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2906.7999999999997s)]
*  Most of the people I fought against undefeated champions. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2908.7599999999998s)]
*  So when Chris Cyborg can do that, she can talk about how many knockouts [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2911.64s)]
*  she's getting, but till then, she can go keep injecting that in her face, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2915.2799999999997s)]
*  trying to make her face look softer because she looked like a damn clown. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2918.96s)]
*  Every time I see her, I just I just can't. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2921.64s)]
*  You know, and then Chris is the app. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2923.96s)]
*  She wanted to learn so much. Oh, oh, oh, I'm your friend. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2925.7999999999997s)]
*  I want you to train MMA. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2929.24s)]
*  And then when I turn MMA to start fighting, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2931.2799999999997s)]
*  I made she wouldn't even come and train with me. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2933.68s)]
*  Wow. But she was like, oh, when you train MMA, I'm going to teach you this [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2935.4399999999996s)]
*  and teach you that. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2939.0s)]
*  She won't even come train with me because I beat her up when we sparred. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2939.7999999999997s)]
*  So she's an opp. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2942.8399999999997s)]
*  She should have took that money that them dudes have us to fight over there [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2943.68s)]
*  in Saudi when they offer me three million to offer her one. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2946.68s)]
*  She should have took the money. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2949.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you like fighting? She turned that down. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2950.3199999999997s)]
*  She's a punk. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2952.4399999999996s)]
*  Tomas, I want to fight at 147 and you're bigger than me. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2953.16s)]
*  Why do we got to fight at 154? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2957.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm like, sis, let's get some money. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2959.28s)]
*  What's the problem? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2961.44s)]
*  Oh, no, I want to fight at 147. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2963.1200000000003s)]
*  I've never made 147, so I'm not going to 47. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2965.1600000000003s)]
*  What's something about the way women's boxing is promoted [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2968.36s)]
*  that makes you cringe, but you haven't publicly called it out yet? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2970.6800000000003s)]
*  For me, how they act like putting women on men's undercards doesn't help the women. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2973.8s)]
*  They keep trying to say, oh, it's not beneficial. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2980.4s)]
*  But that's how they build their men champions up [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2983.0400000000004s)]
*  to where they can become main event fighters. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2985.4s)]
*  So when I was saying, hey, I want to fight the undercard of Deontay Wilder, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2988.16s)]
*  Terrence Crawford, Earl Spence, Pacquiao, guys of that nature, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2991.84s)]
*  I was always being told, oh, that's not going to help you, girl. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2995.64s)]
*  That's not going to help your brand. That's not going to. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=2998.36s)]
*  Yes, it is. If if if 20 million people is tuning in to see Anthony Josh will fight, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3000.16s)]
*  I'm the co-main event. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3005.04s)]
*  At least 10 of them going to be there or 15 waiting to get to the so they can [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3006.32s)]
*  see me fight and they can become fans of me. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3011.28s)]
*  But they act like that's false information when I know that it's true, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3013.88s)]
*  because I've seen them do it with the men who I fight better than that. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3017.84s)]
*  Now that these men are getting main event cards, I'm like, huh, that's funny. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3021.16s)]
*  He fight pay-per-view and I know damn well he can fight better than me. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3024.68s)]
*  Seemed like a no brainer. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3027.72s)]
*  Yeah, hell yeah. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3028.88s)]
*  Who was that fight? The Taylor Serrano fight? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3030.12s)]
*  Who was that? That was on the undercard of Mike Tyson, Jake Paul. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3032.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3035.08s)]
*  That was the best fight on the card that night. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3036.64s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3039.0s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Clarissa Shields. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3040.32s)]
*  Jess, your name has been being a lot of [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3042.12s)]
*  a lot of conversations, you know, not only even for boxing, though, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3045.72s)]
*  but your personal life as well. Right. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3048.6s)]
*  And do you feel like because your personal life, you know, like your love life [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3050.2s)]
*  and everything like even online, that gets like more publicity [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3054.7999999999997s)]
*  than like things like your movie or your fights. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3059.24s)]
*  Do you feel like that helps or hurts your career in any type of way? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3061.52s)]
*  I feel like everything helps. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3065.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3066.7599999999998s)]
*  Women's boxing is a very hard market for people to find out about you. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3067.3599999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3071.8799999999997s)]
*  Like I've been the best fighter in the world since I was 17 years old. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3072.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm 30 now. That's 13 years of dominance, of not losing. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3075.7999999999997s)]
*  I got 17 world titles, five different divisions, fourth time undisputed champion. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3079.3199999999997s)]
*  I've accomplished everything you can accomplish in boxing. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3083.6s)]
*  So therefore, all this stuff that my name being is like, you know what? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3086.04s)]
*  It's beneficial. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3090.3599999999997s)]
*  I just have to make sure it's going the direction that I want it to go. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3091.16s)]
*  I want to be Beyonce. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3095.2s)]
*  OK, I want to be like Serena Williams. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3097.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't want to be like, I don't even want to get a bad example. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3099.28s)]
*  It's a bunch. But I want to be like on that caliber of Muhammad Ali. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3102.48s)]
*  So doing that, I can't entertain everything, you know, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3107.2000000000003s)]
*  even though it may give me more followers. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3111.84s)]
*  But it's not something that's going toward where I'm trying to go to in my career [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3114.32s)]
*  and in my life, because I'm trying to go to the 50 and 20 and 100 million dollars. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3118.0800000000004s)]
*  Some stuff that I may entertain could stop that. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3123.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3126.8799999999997s)]
*  My name be everywhere. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3128.3999999999996s)]
*  Every day is somebody else making a damn podcast. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3130.0s)]
*  It's somebody else making a video. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3133.2799999999997s)]
*  It's somebody else putting pictures. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3135.08s)]
*  They got old pictures in me, new pictures in me and pictures of me. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3136.9199999999996s)]
*  And it's just every day is something. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3140.9599999999996s)]
*  And it just takes a lot of mind power to like, you know what? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3143.48s)]
*  Welcome to our world. I know. Right. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3147.48s)]
*  Let me just, you know, how did you meet? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3149.12s)]
*  We managed to court fight July 6 last year. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3151.2799999999997s)]
*  I had a fight. OK. Yeah, that's what I said. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3154.0s)]
*  How did you know he was the one? How did you? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3156.6s)]
*  I'm sure he'll kick it to you all the time. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3158.32s)]
*  How did you know, like, he was the one? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3160.52s)]
*  He's a smooth cat, man. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3162.48s)]
*  See, the thing is, I got told that I didn't really like boys till I was 15. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3163.76s)]
*  So now I've had a few boyfriends here and there. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3168.52s)]
*  And I remember, like, Pap, he walked up to me and he shook my hand, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3170.44s)]
*  which I was like, like hands. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3173.84s)]
*  Who shakes hands? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3175.8s)]
*  That was kind of my mind. Like, what the hell? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3176.96s)]
*  And then he just mentioned, like, oh, I watched you fight in the Olympics. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3178.64s)]
*  I'm a fan. I've been a fan, you know, and I was like, well, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3182.2400000000002s)]
*  I fight in two weeks in Detroit, you know, if you if you freeze, you come out. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3185.08s)]
*  He like, I'm coming. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3189.12s)]
*  And I always get that from celebrities, though. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3190.04s)]
*  They always say, oh, we're going to come. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3192.4s)]
*  We're going to come. And then fight night come. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3194.56s)]
*  And then they don't come. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3196.6s)]
*  So I think it was coming. I'm like, all right, cool. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3198.0s)]
*  I'm like, we took a picture, which I'm going to get to that in a minute. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3199.92s)]
*  But we took a picture and I posted it on my page. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3203.64s)]
*  But it was my second picture because I think G Herbo was the first picture. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3206.68s)]
*  And then when I posted it, I DMed him the picture. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3209.68s)]

*  And then she brought him to the back. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3228.56s)]
*  And I was like, oh, he came to the fight. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3229.7999999999997s)]

*  I know he was the one. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3235.2799999999997s)]
*  I came here to the Breakfast Club last year. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3236.64s)]
*  He kept saying he wants to go out to eat when I come to New York. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3238.72s)]
*  You want to take me out to eat? [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3241.12s)]
*  And I was just like, why would you want to go out to eat for us? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3242.28s)]
*  Like, what's up? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3244.6400000000003s)]
*  And we had we have been texting back and forth and stuff like that. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3245.76s)]
*  But he's really hard to be not hard to read, but he's very like [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3249.44s)]
*  private throughout the text. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3252.52s)]
*  And so he actually want to talk to you in person. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3253.84s)]
*  So when we talked in person, that's when I was like, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3255.76s)]
*  I kind of like this dude. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3258.0800000000004s)]
*  And he just was like, so kind, so nice. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3259.4s)]
*  And I think we had a conversation before, like, do you like bad boys? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3261.7200000000003s)]
*  The good boys? I like a good guy. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3263.96s)]

*  Come on now. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3281.0s)]
*  You said there's some things he needs to handle. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3284.84s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3286.36s)]
*  Oh, I mean, yeah, it's the elephant in the room. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3287.52s)]
*  I don't have to say it. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3289.76s)]
*  And his personal life. Oh, yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3291.6s)]
*  Yeah, but that takes time. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3293.36s)]
*  And like I said, that's not my place to speak on. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3295.88s)]
*  You know, I'm saying like it again. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3297.88s)]
*  I just know that from my perspective, I'm with him. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3299.4s)]
*  I'm with him every day. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3302.0s)]
*  And when I'm not with him, we're on the phone every day. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3303.52s)]
*  And we're talking and we're FaceTime and we love each other. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3305.76s)]
*  So that's just kind of what it is. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3308.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? But hey, it's a situation and it is what it is. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3310.52s)]
*  I'm assuming you mean like you want to wait till the divorce is like official. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3312.96s)]
*  Official. Does that hold you? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3315.96s)]
*  Does that keep you from giving your all? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3317.12s)]
*  No, because we're together all the time. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3319.08s)]
*  So the all is already given, is what she's saying. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3320.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3323.08s)]
*  We already talk. We talk about so many different things. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3324.36s)]
*  I'm 30, so we talk about kids and family and stuff like that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3327.4s)]
*  But that still has to be taken care of. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3331.0s)]
*  But like, you know, once again, it's not it's not for me. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3332.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm not I'm not married. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3335.64s)]
*  Yeah. So that'll get handled. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3337.96s)]
*  But still, at the same time, I've been like, I'm such a secure woman [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3340.2s)]
*  when it like comes to him because he's proven it to me. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3344.04s)]
*  Like I was I was when somebody is just truthful with you from the beginning. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3346.2s)]
*  There is no there is no secrets there. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3349.92s)]
*  There is just a this is what it is. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3352.04s)]
*  And do you accept or do you not accept? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3354.52s)]
*  That's kind of what it was. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3356.48s)]
*  And he's been true from the beginning. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3357.6s)]
*  And we felt they want to phone for three, four months of us first getting together. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3359.2000000000003s)]
*  So for us to fall asleep on a regular night and then to wake up to chaos [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3363.08s)]
*  in the morning was like, oh, you see, that's how we found out. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3367.16s)]
*  Because I was on the damn phone. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3369.7200000000003s)]
*  But that had been going on for three, four months. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3371.08s)]
*  And that wasn't just at night. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3373.28s)]
*  We talked from sun up to sundown. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3374.6s)]
*  Yeah. Like I said, that's what shocked me because I was like, oh, hell, what the heck? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3377.0s)]
*  Because if we go to sleep on a phone for four months every night [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3380.7200000000003s)]
*  in the phone is saying is four hours, three hours, whatever hours on the phone. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3385.16s)]
*  You don't think that one day you're going to wake up to that. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3389.88s)]
*  You know, so that's what threw me off. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3393.16s)]
*  But hey, at the end of the day, look, women are women. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3395.2s)]
*  I don't know what I don't know what else to say. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3398.2400000000002s)]
*  Like I don't have any ill will toward any women. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3399.92s)]
*  You know, I have an ill will toward her. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3403.04s)]
*  Yeah. So you all haven't spoken. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3405.12s)]
*  No, no, I mean, she made her post and that was about it. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3406.68s)]
*  But like I said, women are women. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3410.32s)]
*  They're very emotional creatures. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3412.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3414.36s)]
*  And I think that was just I don't know. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3415.0s)]
*  I don't know what it was. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3417.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know. It was emotions or I don't know what it was because I don't know her. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3418.52s)]
*  And she don't know me. You know what I'm saying? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3422.4s)]
*  So, yeah, I don't know what that was. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3423.88s)]
*  But like I said, it's not it wasn't for me. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3425.6000000000004s)]
*  That's why I just responded how I responded. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3427.84s)]

*  Last Friday, twelve thousand. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3439.7200000000003s)]

*  I don't know if this is a dumb question or not, but look right. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3461.88s)]
*  So when guys box like I hear that they can't have sex [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3464.2400000000002s)]
*  like before the fight because it messes up like that. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3467.84s)]
*  I guess adrenaline need to be pumped up or whatever. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3470.64s)]
*  But is it the same with women like you can? [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3472.8399999999997s)]

*  But when it comes to like the actual penetration part. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3495.3999999999996s)]

*  of everything. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3569.1200000000003s)]
*  What was the latest on the Breakfast Club? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3569.44s)]
*  All righty, guys, so I would like to introduce you to Sheree Hayes. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3573.52s)]
*  This is the Punisher. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3578.2000000000003s)]
*  The Punisher took the stand in the Diddy trial yesterday and he was the fact he [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3580.36s)]
*  didn't wear it on. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3587.4s)]
*  He did not wear this, but he is an exotic male dancer. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3588.4s)]
*  So this is a photo from his Instagram. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3591.0800000000004s)]
*  And he testified about, you know, different sexual encounters he had with Diddy and [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3593.52s)]
*  Cassie. And more explicitly, he talked about a book, a book that he wrote called [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3598.84s)]
*  A Book That He Wrote, where he talks about freezer meat and not being able to get [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3606.04s)]
*  erect. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3610.08s)]
*  What the hell is freezer meat? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3610.68s)]
*  So freezer meat is it leans into the term of like, you know, if something's frozen, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3612.2s)]
*  it gets hard. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3616.4s)]
*  Like a rack of lamb in the freezer. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3617.16s)]
*  Yeah, but it gets small too. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3618.48s)]
*  Like steak or like chicken, this hard meat. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3620.52s)]
*  Paws. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3622.4s)]
*  Fingerloin. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3622.8s)]
*  OK, yes, I guess. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3624.52s)]
*  But basically his book is all about how he was having these different sexual [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3625.92s)]
*  experiences throughout his career. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3629.72s)]
*  And he realized he had erectile dysfunction and it caused some issues with his mental [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3631.04s)]
*  health because he couldn't, you know, I mean, do this thing, do his thing. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3634.52s)]
*  But the reason why the book came into conversation on the stand was because he [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3637.08s)]
*  actually talked about Cassie and Diddy in the book and the alleged interactions [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3640.8s)]
*  that he had with them. But he never named them. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3646.36s)]
*  He called them a wealthy married couple in the book. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3648.32s)]
*  Now, I've read there's about six pages that is out here from this book. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3651.0s)]
*  Give us some excerpts. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3655.4s)]
*  I got the excerpts. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3656.8s)]
*  So he talked about, you know, when he first met Cassie and Diddy, it was at the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3658.0s)]
*  Trump Hotel in New York, allegedly, and he was called there for like two hundred [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3662.12s)]
*  bucks just to do like an erotic dance and set the scene for a woman in like a [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3666.44s)]
*  birthday situation and to put his penis in the freezer. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3670.68s)]
*  He didn't know that yet. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3673.2s)]
*  So he got there. He said Cassie, he alleged Cassie opened the door. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3674.88s)]
*  She's in a wig, glasses. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3678.16s)]
*  She's beautiful. He's like, oh, wow. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3679.48s)]
*  And she had a robe on with nothing under. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3681.64s)]
*  And that was very obvious. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3683.6s)]
*  So he says that Cassie explained to him, like, look, my husband likes to see me, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3684.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, he's a voyeurist. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3688.52s)]
*  He likes to see me with other men. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3689.64s)]
*  But so all we want you to do right now is just like do a sexy dance with me, you, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3691.68s)]
*  you know, baby, or you might come into play and he may come in the room, but [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3696.08s)]
*  don't acknowledge him. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3699.3999999999996s)]
*  Like he's not going to get involved in doing the knowledge. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3700.4399999999996s)]
*  So that's what made him soft. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3702.4799999999996s)]
*  You got this fine woman in front of you and all of a sudden he come. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3704.7999999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3708.68s)]
*  But then you're not supposed to eat the street meat. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3709.3599999999997s)]
*  But yeah, so that's exactly what began happening. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3712.24s)]
*  So he says that, you know, they were doing exactly what they described. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3714.3999999999996s)]
*  And the first time he couldn't get into it is because Diddy allegedly was [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3719.08s)]
*  subtly say these things in the corner, like instructing her. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3724.6s)]
*  He said, like, he said, you know, cause he used to work in the clubs. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3730.64s)]
*  He's a rock dancer. He said, so he's a little bit deaf from all of the [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3733.12s)]
*  music and the sounds. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3736.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, you work in a club all the time is loud. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3739.68s)]
*  So you're hearing some people to hear and be a bit off. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3741.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3743.2799999999997s)]
*  So he said, did he come in? [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3743.48s)]
*  Listen, so he said that Diddy would say things. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3745.52s)]
*  He said, for example, he said, now the husband might be in the corner [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3748.08s)]
*  saying something like to the wife, move to the right. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3751.04s)]
*  But he'd hear, I bet that a hole fire. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3753.56s)]
*  He said, but he'd hear, I bet that a hole is tight. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3756.7999999999997s)]
*  Fire. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3759.48s)]
*  And it would make him instantly. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3760.92s)]
*  It would make him instantly go soft. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3762.84s)]
*  So he was having issues. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3765.44s)]
*  I sent you the real episode. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3766.52s)]
*  Diddy was saying move to the right and you saying that butt hole tights. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3769.88s)]
*  That's what he was hearing. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3772.44s)]
*  So he was like, yo, hold on. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3773.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3775.44s)]
*  So then he said he had this encounter with Cassie. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3775.72s)]
*  It was a, it was great. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3778.68s)]
*  He alleged it was great or whatever. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3779.92s)]
*  Now you left out a very valuable. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3781.2799999999997s)]
*  Yum. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3784.48s)]
*  I bet his a hole tight. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3785.24s)]

*  Move to the right. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3789.88s)]
*  But he heard in his head, baby, move over to the right. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3791.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3795.0s)]
*  Oh, see now I see the same right. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3795.48s)]
*  Y'all said, did he said this? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3796.84s)]
*  Did he ain't say this? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3797.84s)]
*  That's what he thought. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3798.64s)]
*  Did he say it? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3800.0s)]
*  Cause he couldn't hear. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3800.56s)]
*  You can't hear. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3803.2799999999997s)]
*  He said that clearly. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3804.7999999999997s)]
*  He was a, he worked at a club. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3805.48s)]
*  He was deaf. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3807.12s)]
*  He couldn't hear. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3807.6s)]
*  Did he said move to the right, but he heard. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3808.2s)]
*  Move over to the right. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3810.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3811.2799999999997s)]
*  Man, get this man out the stand. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3811.7999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3812.7999999999997s)]
*  So then, yeah, if y'all going to play, let me go on the stand and play. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3813.2799999999997s)]
*  I got to play. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3817.48s)]
*  Another example is he said that, uh, Cassie invited him back another time. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3819.44s)]
*  She said she was. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3822.7999999999997s)]
*  He said that did he said, I love that position you're in. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3824.56s)]
*  My deaf interpretation would be, I can't wait to penetrate him. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3827.92s)]
*  What? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3831.64s)]
*  You know, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3833.64s)]
*  I sent you another one. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3838.48s)]
*  So, so he said that, you know, Cassie said, yo, I'm really comfortable with you [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3840.2s)]
*  allegedly, and I want you to come back. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3843.56s)]
*  We're going to do this again. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3845.36s)]
*  So they called him again when they were back in New York, allegedly to another [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3846.6s)]
*  hotel and he said, but this time he was like, yo, she says she wants it to go [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3849.48s)]
*  further. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3853.36s)]
*  I got to be ready. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3853.8s)]
*  So he took a ed pill, a dysfunction pill, right? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3854.56s)]
*  And cause he, he wanted to be able to like. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3858.24s)]
*  A rectal dysfunction. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3860.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3861.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3861.52s)]
*  I said it. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3862.2s)]
*  He wanted to be able to do all the things. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3862.6s)]
*  So he said, as he was like, you know, getting ready to do all the things with [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3864.3599999999997s)]
*  her, he said he performed a Bruce lick tongue Kung Fu into the 36 chambers [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3867.92s)]
*  style, fellatio act. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3874.3199999999997s)]
*  What is a Bruce? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3875.88s)]
*  I know the judge was like, what the hell are these people went into? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3876.6s)]
*  That's what he said on the stand. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3881.92s)]
*  That's what he performed. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3883.12s)]
*  This is the episode from the book. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3883.96s)]
*  He just talked. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3885.12s)]
*  He, he talked about the experiences and went into the book, but this is from the [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3885.68s)]
*  actual book. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3888.56s)]
*  We went and well, TMZ and a couple of the outlets when he found the book. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3889.12s)]
*  So he says after that, you know, they, they actually begin to be able to like [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3892.68s)]
*  have sex and dang up here, starting over, saying sex. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3896.4s)]
*  Um, so then he took the ed pill or whatever. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3899.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3902.48s)]
*  No, eventually he was able to orgasm or finish. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3903.24s)]
*  And, um, he referred to his butt as a chamber. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3908.64s)]
*  No, that's don't refer to nobody. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3912.72s)]
*  But is it? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3914.48s)]
*  That was the box. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3914.88s)]
*  He was referring to the box. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3915.68s)]
*  It was his tongue. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3916.72s)]
*  Like it was, he was. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3917.44s)]
*  The box as a chamber. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3918.68s)]
*  Food. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3919.7599999999998s)]
*  You are not following me at all. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3920.9199999999996s)]
*  Um, so he said eventually, eventually he got to a point where he was, you know, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3922.8399999999997s)]
*  they're actually engaging and, and you know, having sex and he couldn't finish. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3927.12s)]
*  And it was obvious that the couple wanted him to finish the couple he sang was [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3932.12s)]
*  Cassie and Diddy allegedly. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3935.72s)]
*  So he says he was like, all right, I got next time I got to take these other [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3937.08s)]
*  pills. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3940.2799999999997s)]
*  So he took a density pill to make it where he was able to get to the end, but it [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3940.6s)]
*  was so dense that he couldn't finish. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3944.96s)]
*  So he had a drink. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3947.48s)]
*  He OD'd on the ED pills. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3948.52s)]
*  So now you gotta take another pill to compensate for something else. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3950.2400000000002s)]
*  Like to wake you up a little bit. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3953.92s)]
*  No, he was woke. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3955.16s)]
*  He was too woke. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3956.28s)]
*  He had to step out the room, Google it, drink some water, came back and now he [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3957.04s)]
*  could finish with Cassie. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3960.68s)]
*  This is what he's alleging in the book. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3961.64s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3963.32s)]
*  I'm not, let me get to the point. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3963.76s)]
*  So he says he actually got to the part where he, yes you do. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3965.8s)]
*  He actually got to the part where he was able to finish and he said he was weirded [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3968.6s)]
*  out again and went soft again because he felt like the husband was helping the wife [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3971.88s)]
*  clean up from him doing all the things all over her and he was licking her clean [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3976.56s)]
*  and that completely turned him off. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3982.16s)]
*  And he alleges that he went soft again. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3984.24s)]
*  Okay, I don't believe this now. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3986.08s)]
*  Damn no. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3986.36s)]
*  I don't believe this. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3987.08s)]
*  So you're saying. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3987.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3988.84s)]
*  Okay, break it down. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3989.56s)]
*  It was a whole semen slurpee. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3990.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3993.36s)]
*  I don't believe this. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3993.92s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3995.04s)]
*  That's according to his book. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3996.44s)]
*  I don't believe this. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3997.84s)]
*  And Diddy is the drinker. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=3998.68s)]
*  I don't believe this. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4000.12s)]
*  I believed when you told me, I believed when you told me he took the semen and [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4001.0s)]
*  rubbed it on the nipples. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4004.16s)]
*  I don't believe this. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4004.96s)]
*  Why don't you playboy the book? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4005.72s)]
*  Why don't you believe it? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4007.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4009.12s)]
*  You still ain't telling me where the tenderloins came into play. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4009.7599999999998s)]
*  No, your middle is because he's having issues with getting hard. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4013.24s)]
*  So why would he compare himself to freezer meat if he can't get hard? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4019.12s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4021.7999999999997s)]
*  He wanted to be freezer meat. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4022.3599999999997s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4023.8399999999997s)]
*  He was saying he was freezer meat. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4024.7999999999997s)]
*  If you're presenting this freezer meat, I'm expecting some hard pork chops. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4027.48s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4031.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4032.2799999999997s)]
*  Why is the hard chicken thighs and breasts? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4033.12s)]
*  You can't be calling yourself freezer meat. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4035.6s)]
*  See, you slurpy is crazy. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4037.2799999999997s)]
*  I just want to let you know. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4039.2s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4040.0s)]
*  First of all, the part of his book where he talks about this is called the [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4041.0s)]
*  bootleg boy toy. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4043.6s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4044.4s)]
*  But he also says the first time that he saw Diddy in the corner doing all the [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4045.12s)]
*  quiet, whatever he was doing in the corner, Diddy had like one of those, like [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4049.92s)]
*  the Muslim garbs on his face and nothing else. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4053.2s)]
*  He was just naked in the corner. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4055.7999999999997s)]
*  All this for $200. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4057.4s)]
*  No, it ended up being like $2,000 for like 45 minutes. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4058.4s)]
*  You said Muslim garb? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4062.44s)]
*  Like the Muslim garbs. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4063.56s)]
*  Asalama eat cum wasn't happening. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4064.76s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4066.96s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4067.64s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4068.88s)]
*  Now you see that was a terrible witness. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4069.64s)]
*  Well, who's in court today? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4071.88s)]

*  Did anybody verify this other than the Punisher? [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4080.4s)]
*  Well, Cassie did say that they used to meet up with the Punisher, but she [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4083.28s)]
*  ain't getting into all these details. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4086.04s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4087.08s)]
*  And by the way, he's not called the Punisher because of sexual activity. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4087.68s)]
*  He's called the Punisher because he used to be a basketball player. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4090.52s)]
*  And he's posting people up. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4093.7200000000003s)]
*  He got the nickname at Good D. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4095.6s)]
*  He got the nickname playing at basketball at the West 4th Street Courts in New York, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4099.8s)]
*  one of the most famous street ball destinations in the world. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4103.32s)]
*  So they know the Punisher outside. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4106.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4107.84s)]

*  January six riot. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4228.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4229.719999999999s)]
*  Remember President Trump issued full commutations and pardons to those indicted and [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4230.32s)]
*  are sentenced in relation to the attack on the U S Capitol. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4235.12s)]

*  stole personal belongings. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4264.16s)]
*  Allen was previously sentenced to eight years for assaulting officers and smashing that [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4265.84s)]

*  demanding a pardon from President Trump. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4278.24s)]
*  When asked what he'd do if he got out, Allen said, quote, that's just for me to know. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4280.599999999999s)]

*  Keep them. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4288.96s)]
*  Trump's January six pardons are like expired coupons. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4290.92s)]
*  Useless and bound to cause trouble at checkout. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4294.32s)]
*  OK, you know, for most people, if someone is gracious enough to give you a second [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4296.88s)]
*  chance, then you won't need a third. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4301.08s)]
*  Zachary got a pardon and then went and broke into a house after you broke into the [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4303.08s)]
*  Capitol and assaulted police officers. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4308.44s)]
*  That's not a redemption arc. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4310.32s)]
*  That's more like a sequel. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4311.84s)]
*  Nobody asked for. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4312.88s)]
*  OK, the reality is people like Zachary are empowered and emboldened because they got [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4314.08s)]
*  away with something like an attempted coup of this country. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4318.76s)]
*  And because they have President Trump in the office, they feel like the law doesn't [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4321.12s)]
*  apply to them. OK, that's why consequences, the actions are very important because they [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4326.16s)]
*  teach you that you can't just do things in this country. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4330.48s)]
*  OK, this man, Zachary, clearly didn't get enough of prison because if he did, you [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4333.56s)]
*  know, if he did or would have gotten that real prison experience, OK, well, he had to [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4337.5199999999995s)]
*  do that time. I don't think he would just be breaking into houses. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4341.12s)]
*  OK, but this is also the same guy who assaulted a police officer at the Capitol. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4343.76s)]
*  So he really doesn't give a damn about the law. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4347.68s)]
*  OK, I remember when Trump's team said we're only pardoning the best people. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4350.24s)]
*  Turns out best was short for best at reoffending. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4355.84s)]
*  OK, Trump was considering giving compensation to the J-6s and Zachary was one of those [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4359.4s)]
*  ones who demanded a full pardon with compensation. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4364.76s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if there was people who use this as an example as to why the J-6s [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4367.639999999999s)]
*  should receive compensation, because they will say, you know, people like Zachary can't [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4373.48s)]
*  find a job being incarcerated with a stain on his record. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4377.32s)]
*  So he had to resort to crime. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4381.16s)]
*  Now you know how so many black people in the hood feel every day. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4382.8s)]
*  OK, welcome to our world. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4386.04s)]
*  OK, I can see right wing outlets right now saying Zachary just breaking into things like [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4387.4s)]
*  the Capitol and homes because it's a good networking strategy. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4392.44s)]
*  OK, a way for him to meet people. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4396.04s)]
*  What a slap in the face to the MAGA movement. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4398.12s)]
*  OK, what a slap in the face to President Donald J. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4401.8s)]
*  Trump. I'm on record as saying that everyone around Trump should be trying to prove people [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4405.44s)]
*  wrong. OK, don't be the thing folks said you were going to be while you were campaigning. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4411.599999999999s)]
*  Folks said Trump's economic policies, the tariffs could cost people jobs and ruin the [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4418.799999999999s)]
*  economy. So far, so good on that one. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4424.12s)]
*  We said Trump was going to implement Project 2025, an authoritarian rule and ignore the [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4427.12s)]
*  Constitution. Check on that one. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4431.719999999999s)]
*  Folks said the J6 is deserved to be in jail. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4434.32s)]
*  A lot of them already had criminal records. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4436.96s)]
*  And if you storm the Capitol and assaulted law enforcement, then you don't give a damn [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4438.52s)]
*  about this country or the rule of law. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4442.04s)]
*  And Zachary, here you go proving them folks right to. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4443.92s)]
*  And it's not just Zachary. At least eight individuals who are pardoned by President [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4448.72s)]
*  Trump have faced new criminal charges are legal issues. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4452.400000000001s)]

*  OK, this is also a very teachable moment because in life eventually you will always end up [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4464.799999999999s)]

*  All right. Well, thank you for that donkey today. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4513.08s)]
*  Yes, indeed. Now, when we come back, Mikey Sherrell will be joining us. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4514.96s)]

*  Yeah, she's leading in the polls. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4524.599999999999s)]
*  So we're going to talk to Mikey when we come back. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4525.5599999999995s)]
*  So don't go anywhere. It's the Breakfast Club. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4527.08s)]
*  Good morning. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4529.04s)]
*  The Breakfast Club. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4529.84s)]
*  Morning, everybody is DJ, N.V. Jess Hilarious, Charlamagne Naga. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4534.04s)]
*  We are the Breakfast Club. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4538.2s)]
*  We got a special guest in the building. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4539.4s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4540.84s)]
*  She's US representative for New Jersey's 11th Congressional District. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4541.5599999999995s)]
*  And she's running for governor Mikey Sherrell. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4545.04s)]
*  Welcome. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4547.48s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4548.32s)]
*  And for the record, we're all residents of New Jersey, so we will be voting. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4549.36s)]
*  So, oh, OK, we're having this conversation as constituents and potential voters. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4552.36s)]
*  The stakes have just been raised. Got it. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4556.48s)]
*  Well, how are you feeling first and foremost? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4558.12s)]
*  I'm feeling good. I'm feeling very tired. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4559.88s)]
*  But, you know, it's just that time. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4562.48s)]
*  We have 21 days today until the election. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4564.28s)]
*  So it's that final sprint. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4567.24s)]
*  You said something the other day that, you know, is so simple. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4568.68s)]
*  And I can't believe more elected officials aren't saying it, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4571.24s)]
*  but you were criticizing the lack of urgency in regards to Newark Airport. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4573.32s)]
*  That's what I don't understand. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4577.64s)]
*  Like, what are we just waiting for something bad to happen? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4578.92s)]
*  It appears so, because it really... [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4581.8s)]
*  The Secretary of Transportation just doesn't seem to be moving on this. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4585.84s)]
*  And again, you know, I'm I'm a former Navy helicopter pilot. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4589.8s)]
*  I've flown in really crowded airspace. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4593.92s)]
*  So in that in that DC airspace where that helicopter crash happened, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4596.400000000001s)]
*  I flew through there as we were taking people up from Norfolk to the Pentagon. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4601.4800000000005s)]
*  And I'm telling you, 90 seconds outage in crowded airspace [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4606.64s)]
*  where you've got, you know, people on visual flight rules [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4611.08s)]
*  and then you've got people landing. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4613.72s)]
*  That's a lifetime. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4615.76s)]
*  And the fact that that's happened more than once. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4617.28s)]
*  The fact that the Secretary of Transportation [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4620.28s)]
*  has canceled his wife's flight out of Newark [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4623.4400000000005s)]
*  and it hasn't surged personnel in, hasn't said, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4626.32s)]
*  here's how we're going to make the system more redundant [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4629.08s)]
*  so it doesn't keep breaking down, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4631.08s)]
*  hasn't come up with a plan of attack for this. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4633.0s)]
*  Again, it's just the constant incompetence from this administration [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4636.52s)]
*  that just not doing the basic work of government [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4641.76s)]
*  is what as much as anything is just putting everybody at risk. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4646.04s)]
*  Yeah, I saw a statement from him this morning [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4651.36s)]
*  when he said now is the time to install a state of the art, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4652.76s)]
*  you know, air traffic control system in the Newark. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4656.68s)]
*  But my thing is like, you're the Secretary of Transportation. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4659.4s)]
*  I'm like, do it, get it done. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4661.88s)]
*  Yeah, what is he just saying that hoping somebody does it? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4663.52s)]
*  What the hell? I totally agree with you. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4665.88s)]
*  And if that's going to take a minute, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4667.76s)]
*  what are we going to do in the meantime? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4670.08s)]
*  We can't just say, OK, we're just going to take this airport down [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4671.68s)]
*  for the summer. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4674.32s)]
*  What's the plan until that is installed? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4675.52s)]
*  Is it worth shutting down Newark Airport right now? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4679.28s)]
*  Well, no, we don't want to shut down Newark Airport. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4682.04s)]
*  I mean, imagine, like, just think about, OK, people have, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4684.76s)]
*  you know, kids that are graduating, people have parents [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4689.16s)]
*  that they have to go see that are sick. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4692.32s)]
*  People have to get around, be able to business. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4693.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a comedian. I travel every weekend. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4695.4s)]
*  I get on a plane and fly somewhere every Friday. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4697.68s)]
*  So just and I don't know, I love Newark normally. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4700.2s)]
*  Yeah, I do. I go way out of my way not to have to fly out of JFK [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4704.04s)]
*  or LaGuardia. Same. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4709.08s)]
*  So the idea that somehow we're just going to take that out of service. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4711.72s)]
*  No, we can't. We got to fix it. We got to fix the problem. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4715.4s)]
*  But in the meantime, like, you don't want people to die. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4718.6s)]
*  And that's when we had a mayor Barack here yesterday, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4721.4800000000005s)]
*  and he was saying that people walked off like, you know, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4723.84s)]
*  air traffic controllers left because they didn't want to be responsible [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4727.280000000001s)]
*  for somebody potentially dying. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4729.76s)]
*  Well, they also in the 90 second delay. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4731.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, air traffic control is really difficult. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4736.320000000001s)]
*  And they you know, that that was traumatic [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4739.400000000001s)]
*  to be responsible for people's lives, to have flights in the air. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4743.360000000001s)]
*  And you can't talk to them and just be watching them, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4747.08s)]
*  you know, as you're like, holy crap. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4750.52s)]
*  So they are now on trauma leave, many of them. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4752.68s)]
*  So they are down 20 percent. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4756.24s)]
*  And then we saw the reporting. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4757.8s)]
*  They're supposed to have 11 to 14 air traffic controllers. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4759.56s)]
*  And they had two or three. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4762.56s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4764.88s)]
*  It really doesn't. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4766.16s)]
*  And this is why we need strong Democratic governors. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4767.16s)]
*  It really is why I'm running for governor. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4772.2s)]
*  It is so critically important now, because as governor, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4774.12s)]
*  we need to then have partnerships with our colleges and universities [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4777.2s)]
*  that fast track people through the air traffic control training [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4782.08s)]
*  and then just start to search them. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4785.72s)]
*  And so governors are now having to take on the work [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4787.2s)]
*  that traditionally we left to the federal government, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4790.8s)]
*  because this is a federal government in free fall. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4792.88s)]
*  So if you were governor of New Jersey now, would you I don't know, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4795.12s)]
*  would you declare state of emergency at Newark Airport? [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4797.44s)]
*  Like, what would you do? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4799.16s)]
*  So this is this is the problem. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4800.5199999999995s)]
*  As we start to reorient our system. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4803.84s)]
*  Right. So what I would do is immediately get up a stand up a program [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4806.4800000000005s)]
*  so we could start to train people, send them to that fast track [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4810.8s)]
*  them through the air traffic control school down in Oklahoma, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4814.72s)]
*  get them back as quickly as possible and start to develop this out [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4818.4400000000005s)]
*  and have that so that we have our own pool of people. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4821.76s)]
*  But again, you don't anticipate if you're that you don't anticipate [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4825.56s)]
*  that the federal government is just going to start [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4830.8s)]
*  abdicating all responsibility for things. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4832.48s)]
*  So this training pipeline would take time to get them trained up. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4834.48s)]
*  But yes, I declare state of emergency and get that done quickly, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4837.599999999999s)]
*  as quickly as possible so that we could stand this up. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4840.44s)]
*  And at the same time, be working towards, OK, what's it going to take then [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4844.959999999999s)]
*  if you're going to put in place the equipment that's going to be necessary [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4849.759999999999s)]
*  to run these and is, you know, how does a governor do that? [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4853.28s)]
*  At this point, I am for a hugely expansive role for a governor [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4856.5199999999995s)]
*  because we can't count on our federal government. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4861.16s)]
*  And that's I make even that statement coming out of my mouth sounds crazy. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4863.2s)]
*  But how do we avoid the facts? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4868.56s)]
*  It's the reality. Yeah. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4871.08s)]
*  Some people would say to get things done, you have to work with Trump [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4872.64s)]
*  in his White House somehow some way. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4875.4800000000005s)]
*  So you wouldn't work with Trump in his White House at all. Look, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4877.12s)]
*  if Duffy comes in here and says, OK, I'm going to work with you to actually [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4881.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think of something that I can say on radio. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4885.4800000000005s)]
*  Unscrew up this situation. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4887.68s)]
*  But you need the federal government. Right. You do as a governor. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4892.360000000001s)]
*  We need to find as many pathways as we can. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4895.200000000001s)]
*  But I think when people say they want you to work with Trump, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4897.92s)]
*  because a lot of a lot of people say I want my governor to work with Trump. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4900.4400000000005s)]
*  What they mean is I want you to stop him from doing this crazy stuff. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4903.76s)]
*  I want you to fix the tariff situation that's making my small business go under. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4908.96s)]
*  I need you to make sure he's not arresting a family member of mine [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4914.72s)]
*  in the middle of the night without charges. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4918.360000000001s)]
*  I need you to make sure that they're not cutting funds to Medicaid [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4920.160000000001s)]
*  in the Department of Education. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4924.400000000001s)]
*  So I need you to go work with Trump. That is fair. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4925.6s)]
*  What's I think a false proposition is if you think that by saying, OK, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4929.64s)]
*  I'm just going to give up on, you know, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4935.96s)]
*  diversity programs in my state, like I'm not going to try to get people [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4939.8s)]
*  in my state to succeed that aren't already there because I'm working with Trump. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4943.56s)]
*  That's a false proposition, because that's when the bullying starts, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4947.88s)]
*  because that's when it's you know, what I say is it's not as if these law firms [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4951.360000000001s)]
*  that have caved to Trump or these schools that have caved to Trump. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4955.200000000001s)]
*  That's not going to be the last ask. It's not a one off thing. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4957.88s)]
*  Like, OK, I'm going to cave today and then he's going to leave me alone [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4960.96s)]
*  and I'm just going to run my game. That's not how that goes. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4963.96s)]
*  I say he's like that bully on the playground. Right. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4966.92s)]
*  So you give your lunch money on Monday. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4969.64s)]
*  They're coming back Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4972.4800000000005s)]
*  No parent says just give your lunch money. Just work with them. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4974.6s)]
*  I mean, that no parent has ever said to their kid getting bullied on the playground. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4979.4400000000005s)]
*  Just work with them. Just give in. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4984.16s)]
*  That's not how you deal with this. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4986.92s)]
*  And I think it's a false trap to suggest that somehow it's the responsibility [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4988.64s)]
*  of a governor to undermine our values [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4993.52s)]
*  to get some thing from the federal government. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=4997.8s)]
*  The federal government is supposed to be working in service [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5000.32s)]
*  of the people of this country, not the state government working in service [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5002.639999999999s)]
*  of Trump. I think that's a false idea. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5008.32s)]
*  We're still kicking with Mikey Sherrell. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5013.08s)]
*  She's running for governor of New Jersey. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5015.16s)]
*  Show me. I was watching MSNBC, CNN, something. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5017.639999999999s)]
*  I forgot what it was. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5021.44s)]
*  And I saw an ad that may have a rock and ran about you. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5022.599999999999s)]
*  And it said that you took thirty thousand dollars from Elon Musk's campaign fund [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5025.679999999999s)]
*  and that you made millions on the stock market, tripling your net worth [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5029.879999999999s)]
*  while you were in Congress and you were fined for unreported trade. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5033.16s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5036.679999999999s)]
*  So I've never taken money from Elon Musk. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5038.32s)]
*  There were people who took it and then donated it to charity. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5041.719999999999s)]
*  People from SpaceX, which was one of his companies, they donate [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5044.799999999999s)]
*  individuals from SpaceX donated to my campaign. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5047.48s)]
*  And I, yes, donated in kind to a food bank because I wanted people to know [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5050.28s)]
*  where I stood on it. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5055.2s)]
*  And I have since offered legislation to have Elon Musk [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5056.64s)]
*  drug tested and to get him out of dozing everything. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5060.160000000001s)]
*  But I I also don't trade individual stocks. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5062.96s)]
*  It's been widely reported. I've I my husband doesn't trade. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5069.4800000000005s)]
*  We don't trade individual stocks. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5073.280000000001s)]
*  I don't think anyone in Congress should, quite frankly. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5074.6s)]
*  And I've been on legislation for that. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5076.96s)]
*  I don't hold individual stocks. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5079.4400000000005s)]
*  So when Newsmax claimed that you made seven million dollars from stock trade, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5082.320000000001s)]
*  what are you talking about? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5085.24s)]
*  Newsmax is, first of all, a very questionable organization [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5088.599999999999s)]
*  that is paying multiple fines. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5092.32s)]
*  I'm not sure what they're talking about. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5094.96s)]
*  I would guess that the root of that would be [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5097.5599999999995s)]
*  because some of some of my husband's payments from his company [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5102.4s)]
*  have been in sex, which are immediately and automatically sold. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5105.96s)]
*  But there is no individual stock trade. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5109.679999999999s)]
*  It's not as if I go sit on the House Armed Service Committee [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5111.92s)]
*  and suddenly I'm trading Boeing or something. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5114.32s)]
*  There's none of that. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5116.48s)]
*  I'm totally out of individual stocks. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5117.32s)]
*  And I like I said, I think every member of Congress should be. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5119.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, did you make seven million in stock trades at all? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5123.28s)]
*  I I haven't. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5126.679999999999s)]
*  I don't believe I did, but I'd have to go see what [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5129.5599999999995s)]
*  what that was alluding to again, what kind of came from. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5133.16s)]
*  It was a report in the. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5136.48s)]
*  No, I know it's from Newsmax, which again. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5137.759999999999s)]
*  And then another one in the Washington Free Beacon, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5139.679999999999s)]
*  which is a conservative leaning platform. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5141.16s)]
*  But they said you had increased from between [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5142.88s)]
*  733,209 to over four million in 2019. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5146.4400000000005s)]
*  And then between four million to 13 million in 2024. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5152.24s)]
*  So that's what he got to seven million increase. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5156.4800000000005s)]
*  It's the average of the average average out that. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5158.56s)]
*  Look, I I both my husband and I come from very middle class families. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5163.56s)]
*  My parents were the first in their family to go to college and his were both teachers. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5169.36s)]
*  And then we both went into the military and afterwards he got a good job. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5175.0s)]
*  And I we've been really lucky. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5178.759999999999s)]
*  I really. I really deeply feel like this country has provided [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5181.12s)]
*  an incredible amount of opportunity to us. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5187.4s)]
*  And that's why I think I feel a responsibility to sort of pay that forward. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5190.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's why I think opportunity is so critically important. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5196.320000000001s)]
*  And I often when I think about what democracy means to me, it means opportunity. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5200.2s)]
*  And it means not just opportunity for me, like Trump might say. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5205.72s)]
*  And it doesn't mean opportunity to enrich myself. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5209.88s)]
*  It means opportunity for the greatest amount of people possible. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5212.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's what democracy at its best offers. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5215.92s)]
*  I love that idea that some political philosophers of democracy have [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5218.88s)]
*  that you should create a society so that if you don't know how you're going to be born, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5223.400000000001s)]
*  if you don't know if you're going to be a man or a woman or rich or poor or black or white, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5229.88s)]
*  you have no idea you create a society and then get dropped into it. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5234.68s)]
*  Because if you create that kind of society, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5239.96s)]
*  then you're going to create something that gives everybody the best chance at opportunity. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5242.76s)]
*  And we've had we've been lucky. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5247.56s)]
*  And so right now, what I see is a president in Donald Trump [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5250.6s)]
*  who is trying to stop all opportunity, who's taking, you know, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5256.4400000000005s)]
*  who's enriched himself and his billionaire cronies and is continuing to try to do that [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5260.84s)]
*  and then pulling up the ladder of success behind him. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5265.4800000000005s)]
*  And I see that at every level. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5268.16s)]
*  And that's why to kind of take it full circle, I think as democratic [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5270.68s)]
*  governor running a state that creates that opportunity, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5275.5599999999995s)]
*  like just with Lionsgate and creates pathways for opportunity, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5278.719999999999s)]
*  pre-distribution of wealth, like what you're doing when you create opportunity [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5282.04s)]
*  and you're trying to create generational wealth is you're creating an opportunity [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5287.24s)]
*  for not just the individual, but that person to then get into a good job [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5290.799999999999s)]
*  and then give their kids the kind of, you know, hey, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5295.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm, you know, I'm in this job and my buddy is running the summer internship [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5300.879999999999s)]
*  and I'm going to get you a summer internship. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5304.24s)]
*  You know, that's the kind of opportunity we're talking about. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5306.24s)]
*  And that's what I think we have to create in New Jersey. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5309.719999999999s)]
*  And that's the exact opposite of what's happening in Washington. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5313.28s)]
*  What makes me I agree. Hold on. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5317.76s)]
*  But I just want to be clear, though, because I agree with what you're saying. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5318.599999999999s)]
*  But I just want to be clear because this this ad is running. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5321.08s)]
*  And I'm sure you'll be asked about this a million times. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5323.679999999999s)]
*  You know, if you get an opportunity to just clear it up, I think you should take it now. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5325.88s)]
*  It says she made millions on the stock market, tripling her net worth [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5329.28s)]
*  while in Congress and was then fined for unreported trades. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5332.68s)]
*  Is that true or false? [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5336.04s)]
*  So. I think we made money from my husband's job. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5338.240000000001s)]
*  He gets paid in stocks. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5345.84s)]
*  They're automatically sold. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5348.8s)]
*  So I think we made money there. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5350.360000000001s)]
*  We don't make any individual money stock trading. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5351.96s)]
*  We're out of all individual stocks because I want people to know that I'm not [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5355.200000000001s)]
*  somehow gaining information and enriching myself because of my work in Congress. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5359.24s)]
*  So that's really important to me. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5364.76s)]
*  And I think every member of Congress should do that. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5366.36s)]
*  And I'm on legislation for that. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5369.48s)]
*  Because those stocks get immediately sold, we do a lot of reporting. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5373.5199999999995s)]
*  And at the end of the year, we did an audit of our reporting. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5379.679999999999s)]
*  And I found I didn't. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5384.28s)]
*  The lawyers found a stock trade that had been automatically sold. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5387.08s)]
*  And so we self reported it and paid a fine for that. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5391.12s)]
*  But I think that's what that's alluding to. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5394.96s)]
*  And so, yeah, I was surprised by that attack ad because I was with Mayor Baraka [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5397.6s)]
*  at a debate for two and a half hours the night before it came out. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5401.92s)]
*  And he hadn't raised any of this. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5405.12s)]
*  And I would have liked an opportunity to sort of discuss it there before [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5406.64s)]
*  that at that we're in the final 21 days. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5411.5199999999995s)]
*  So I'm sure things will get spicy, but I'm just really working hard [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5414.8s)]
*  to push out what I want to do for people and my positive agenda. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5418.84s)]

*  I believe you. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5442.4400000000005s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5443.8s)]
*  I will make a commitment right now. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5447.6s)]
*  If I become governor, I will be back on your show if invited. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5449.400000000001s)]

*  Talk to me. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5498.64s)]
*  I'm trying to make it to court. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5500.4800000000005s)]
*  Got to get out of here. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5502.160000000001s)]
*  But I did want to answer your question. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5502.92s)]
*  So you asked me who was testifying today. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5504.360000000001s)]
*  So Dawn Hughes, she is a psychologist who has testified in a lot of high profile [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5505.76s)]
*  cases are Kelly, Johnny Depp and Harvey Weinstein. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5510.56s)]
*  Did he seem of course did not want her to be able to take the stand. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5514.200000000001s)]
*  But she is being allowed to take the stand and she's going to, I guess, speak [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5517.56s)]
*  to the mental, like the thinking and the non-processing and the cognitive. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5520.64s)]
*  Like he made this mistake not only or not, like those type of things that I guess [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5526.36s)]
*  she's seen from other cases that she never spoke to. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5529.799999999999s)]
*  They want to make sure that her testimony is within a certain scope. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5532.799999999999s)]
*  So when they did that before they did it with they did that with Dawn. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5535.92s)]
*  They did that with Dawn where like they were arguing her testimony shouldn't be [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5541.5199999999995s)]
*  able to be allowed because Cassie didn't speak to the domestic violence incident [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5545.24s)]
*  that Dawn alleged she saw. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5549.799999999999s)]
*  But the judge was like, well, we should allow it because it lends into, you know, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5552.0s)]
*  how he was able to coerce or force or whatever, but with only within a certain [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5556.72s)]
*  scope to protect the rights. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5560.320000000001s)]
*  I bet you that scope don't include. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5561.6s)]
*  So if he takes another man's semen and rub it on his nipples, what does that mean [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5563.320000000001s)]
*  psychologically? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5568.04s)]
*  That's just what he liked to do to get off. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5569.12s)]
*  That's not what how a therapist would respond. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5571.2s)]
*  Hey, yeah, I'm not gonna be like, yeah, he was doing his big one. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5573.400000000001s)]
*  That's how he that's how he get out. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5578.92s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5580.16s)]
*  That's his own business. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5580.96s)]
*  Well, now it's all of our business. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5581.96s)]
*  I don't think a therapist would respond like that, but I don't think that would [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5583.84s)]
*  be in the scope. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5585.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't I don't really know where they're going to go with her, but [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5586.72s)]
*  we'll we'll see today. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5589.8s)]
*  And then they're also going to they're going to finish up with a special agent [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5591.52s)]
*  who raided Diddy's home. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5594.92s)]
*  They talked yesterday about the special agent. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5597.04s)]
*  They found like the AR-15s and lube and baby oil and all these different things [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5598.8s)]
*  at Diddy's Miami home. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5603.84s)]
*  Oh, see, I want to hear more from them because everybody talks about I saw [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5605.4400000000005s)]
*  somebody say the other day that Diddy was never under investigation. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5608.0s)]
*  That is just not true. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5611.64s)]
*  Like there was a whole federal investigation. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5613.64s)]
*  They raided his house. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5615.4s)]
*  Yeah, there's a man named Jordan. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5616.56s)]
*  But his son made a song and was like, you're already the wrong house. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5617.76s)]
*  Come back and try to do it. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5621.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was done. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5622.4s)]
*  So don't homeland security investigations agent. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5623.04s)]
*  His name was his name is Gerard Gannon. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5626.6s)]
*  He started testifying yesterday and he's going to finish up today detailing the [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5628.32s)]
*  March 20, 24 raid that they did on a Miami estate. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5632.36s)]
*  He was a special agent in charge and he said it was like 80 to 90 agents that [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5635.64s)]
*  were involved in. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5639.64s)]
*  They found AR-15 rifles loaded with bullets. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5641.08s)]
*  Serial numbers scratched off. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5645.72s)]
*  They found sex toys, astroglyph lubricant. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5647.320000000001s)]
*  And of course, they show photos to the jury of all of these things. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5650.4400000000005s)]
*  And they said that they found the guns in Diddy's bedroom closet in Miami. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5654.08s)]
*  So and these were included in the federal indictment. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5658.84s)]
*  So he's going to finish up and talk about some more things. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5661.68s)]
*  I'm assuming that they found and then they are going to bring on George Kaplan, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5664.24s)]
*  who is an employee that used to work for them, that used to work for Diddy, that [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5668.5599999999995s)]
*  alleges he quit after seeing some physical violence or physical abuse. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5672.4s)]
*  And then Kid Cudi is on the list for today, but they don't believe they'll get [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5677.84s)]
*  to Kid Cudi. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5681.679999999999s)]
*  And I was told that they probably won't get to Kid Cudi, that Kid Cudi will [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5682.28s)]
*  probably open up the testimonies on Thursday. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5685.5199999999995s)]
*  So there's that. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5687.88s)]
*  And they've been having a conversation, not in court, but I saw CNN did an [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5688.639999999999s)]
*  article about Diddy's wealth, because as of right now, Forbes still has some [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5692.92s)]
*  value at like four hundred million dollars. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5696.0s)]
*  I saw that. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5697.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5698.2s)]
*  And Laura Coates, she did a really good breakdown about what happens to his money. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5698.56s)]
*  Because I think a lot of people have been trying to figure it out, too. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5702.84s)]
*  Like, does he still have the money? [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5704.56s)]
*  Does he not? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5705.76s)]
*  And she had this expert on who talked about because they didn't mention taking [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5707.16s)]
*  any of his money prior to any of the search and seizures that they did. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5711.68s)]
*  Everything's up for grabs right now. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5715.28s)]
*  But basically, it would depend on what they prove in court and how that money [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5716.68s)]
*  came in to support that, because a lot of the big thing that they're leaning on [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5721.0s)]
*  right now is this was the enterprise. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5725.12s)]
*  Takes money to fund the enterprise. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5726.76s)]
*  So I'm assuming that whatever they can prove money wise went into this [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5728.12s)]
*  enterprise and you know what I mean? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5732.52s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't understand. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5734.4s)]
*  I watched that. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5735.12s)]
*  I didn't understand it. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5735.88s)]
*  I'm like, well, how would they be able to take his assets? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5736.68s)]
*  Like, I didn't I didn't understand it. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5738.76s)]
*  From what I took from the expert that was talking was that the assets would come [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5740.4s)]
*  in where I guess like the liquid cash couldn't anymore because you have to make [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5744.76s)]
*  up for it, right? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5747.96s)]
*  Like what you're not able to recoup and what they're saying that you use. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5748.6s)]
*  And we did a lot of money. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5751.88s)]
*  I'm sure pre-cost didn't cost a billion dollars. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5754.12s)]
*  And they also talked to David James, who's one of the, well, was one of Diddy's [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5756.4800000000005s)]
*  assistants for two years. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5759.92s)]
*  They had him on the scene and he talked about being told how to, when he would go [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5761.52s)]
*  buy things that, you know, were obviously not just for work, they would tell him [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5765.76s)]
*  like, baby, will you write how to put it where it's not being listed as if bad boy [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5770.72s)]
*  was paying for it. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5775.4s)]
*  That. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5776.64s)]
*  He got no petty cash for that. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5777.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5778.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5780.28s)]
*  So it was personal. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5780.68s)]
*  That's what that's, you know, he said he messed up because the first time he paid [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5781.72s)]
*  for it and they were like, no, don't do it that way. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5784.68s)]
*  So he paid for it with the corporate card. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5786.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5788.2s)]
*  So he had to do it a different way. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5788.4s)]
*  And that, that same assistant is the one who gave more context to that Shig Knight [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5789.64s)]
*  situation. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5793.4s)]
*  And he said that, you know, I think I talked about this with y'all yesterday. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5794.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5797.76s)]
*  He went into that, but they tried to get the defense, tried to get the assistant [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5797.92s)]
*  out of here too. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5801.32s)]
*  They brought up a time where I guess he got into it with one of the chefs that [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5802.44s)]
*  used to work for Chef Jordan, that guy that was working for Diddy. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5805.08s)]
*  And it just sounded like though that he became almost like a product of the [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5809.6s)]
*  environment that he was in. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5813.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's what they were pointing to a lot of those things trying to discredit [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5814.8s)]
*  him. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5818.32s)]
*  But in my opinion, it sounded like, okay, he was in this environment where all this [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5818.48s)]
*  crazy stuff was happening and he just started doing what he was seeing. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5821.48s)]
*  But he testified that he saw, and we was overworked and that he saw things that [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5824.72s)]
*  just didn't make sense and that he had to run down on Shig Knight or would have [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5829.5199999999995s)]
*  if Shig Knight would have actually been there. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5833.5599999999995s)]
*  I was thinking about that. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5834.88s)]
*  If all of this stuff is true, Shig Knight ain't had nothing on Diddy. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5835.96s)]
*  What you mean? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5839.52s)]
*  He thinks so or do we just not? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5840.04s)]
*  Shig Knight has always been known as the boogie man of hip hop. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5840.56s)]
*  But if all of this stuff is true, Shug ain't had nothing on Diddy. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5843.64s)]
*  Oh, you mean as far as the type of person they are? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5848.200000000001s)]
*  Being a boogie man. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5850.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5851.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5851.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5853.8s)]
*  Like bad boys, bad boys for real. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5854.320000000001s)]
*  May I have a question? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5856.04s)]
*  Is this trial consuming you, Lauren? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5856.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5858.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5858.92s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5859.8s)]
*  Last weekend, that's why I went to the comedy show. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5860.240000000001s)]
*  Dress was great. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5862.52s)]
*  I went to the comedy show. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5863.4s)]
*  I tried to stay off line, not even just the trial, but even the coverage of it, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5864.5599999999995s)]
*  because things are starting to go viral. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5867.679999999999s)]
*  It's like so many more people's opinions and people calling me and I'm just like, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5868.96s)]
*  oh, I'm just going to release just relax. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5872.88s)]
*  And you don't gotta answer the phone. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5875.5199999999995s)]
*  I didn't realize until this that I don't know how to disconnect. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5878.08s)]
*  So last weekend was my first time trying of like, OK, I'm just going to hang with my [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5880.679999999999s)]
*  family. I'm not going to get on my phone. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5883.88s)]
*  I would not post. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5886.12s)]
*  I got right off. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5887.28s)]
*  I didn't look at notifications. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5888.08s)]
*  Normally I engage in my comments. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5889.48s)]
*  I'm not doing that no more. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5890.8s)]
*  When I leave the court, I'm getting my Uber and going home. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5892.44s)]
*  Like, I don't need to run into no more. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5894.76s)]
*  You're telling all your base. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5896.68s)]
*  So now you ain't got to freaking try to juggle three or four of them at one time. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5897.68s)]
*  It's no way. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5901.12s)]
*  She can't make it better. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5901.68s)]
*  Huh? Just mess up your baby. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5903.12s)]
*  I'm not juggling anything. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5904.5599999999995s)]
*  OK, I am not flowing effortlessly in one direction and I'm good. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5905.92s)]
*  Because you see into the mix. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5910.32s)]
*  You don't got time to juggle nothing. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5911.68s)]
*  No, wow. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5913.16s)]
*  Diddy, diddy, diddy every day. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5914.16s)]
*  No, but you know, the people that support me are doing a really good job of making [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5915.96s)]
*  sure I disconnect and I get time off and date nights and things like that. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5919.12s)]
*  So I'm good. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5922.48s)]

*  He's feeling good. He's feeling good. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5960.96s)]
*  He said he can't really say too much. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5962.12s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? He definitely want to drag his. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBTeU_p1u-M&t=5963.56s)]
