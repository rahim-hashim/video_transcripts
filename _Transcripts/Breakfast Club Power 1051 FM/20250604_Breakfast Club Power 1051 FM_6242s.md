# The Breakfast Club FULL SHOW 06-04-25
**Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU)
*  good morning USA [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=0.02s)]
*  Jess would be here in a second [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=9.5s)]
*  I'm not even going forward [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=24.5s)]
*  the whole gang is late [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=26.42s)]
*  and I just walked in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=27.76s)]
*  I don't know what their excuses I think Charlamagne might have overslept. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=30.0s)]
*  I know I think Jess couldn't find her car keys. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=32.64s)]
*  But for myself it's them damn puppies I just purchased. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=35.04s)]
*  The dogs are getting you like, yo them dogs are kicking my ass. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=38.28s)]
*  Now you know I haven't had a puppy in a long time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Probably since I was a kid right? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=46.4s)]
*  My last dog Chuck Norris who I still have, I bought the dog as an adult. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=47.8s)]
*  He was house trained, he went outside in the woods. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  There was not really much to do. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=54.28s)]
*  He didn't chew up furniture. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=55.78s)]
*  Not these puppies. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=57.72s)]
*  These puppies bark and whine all night. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=59.52s)]
*  I know what you're thinking, them be their puppies. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  Yes, then when I wake up, you know they had a little accident in their crate which is [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=63.52s)]
*  not a problem. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=67.12s)]
*  I cleaned it up so I put them on the porch right fast while I cleaned it up. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=68.12s)]
*  Then when I go back to get them, there's poop on the porch. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=70.84s)]
*  That's like two days in a row now right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  Yes! [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=76.28s)]
*  So then I gotta clean up the poop, put them back in, make sure that they're bathed and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=77.28s)]
*  their paws are clean because I'm walking them back in the house. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=80.48s)]
*  And that just now I'm running for time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  And that's such a tough thing to do at like three in the morning. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=85.84s)]
*  Yes! [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  You're running, you're trying to be quiet, the whole house is sleeping. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=88.88s)]
*  But nah, B, today I'm getting a dog run. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=91.72s)]
*  I'm gonna build a dog run so I'm going to track the supply, I'm gonna build one and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=94.0s)]
*  I'm gonna put them out there for a little bit. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=97.12s)]
*  Because this is getting a lot! [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=98.6s)]
*  But salute to anybody that has a puppy and knows this pain but it's fun man. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=100.44s)]
*  Seeing the kids just enjoy the puppy and play with the puppies is like everything. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=103.36s)]
*  But I shouldn't have just got one. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=106.6s)]
*  My wife wanted two and yeah, whatever wife wants, wife gets. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=108.12s)]
*  It is what it is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=112.84s)]
*  It's a boy and a girl right? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=113.84s)]
*  Two girls, two sisters, two girls. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=114.84s)]
*  Yes, two girls. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=115.84s)]
*  Alright, well let's get the show cracking. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=116.84s)]
*  Now like I said, the gang will be here in a second but we have Mara Brock Akil joining [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  us this morning. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=122.04s)]
*  She's of course a television producer. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=123.04s)]
*  She has written on the Jamie Foxx show, she has done Being Mary Jane, The Game, Friends, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=126.28s)]

*  She has a new show on Netflix called Forever. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=133.76s)]
*  So we'll talk about her. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=136.4s)]
*  And that's from Judy Blume's book, I'm not sure what the name of it, I'm not a Judy [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  Blume fan, Charlamagne is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=142.24s)]
*  Charlamagne will be cursing me out right now but yeah, it's based off a Judy Blume book [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=143.6s)]
*  and we'll be talking to her. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=147.16s)]
*  And also, Lyncia Kabidi. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=148.2s)]
*  I'm saying that wrong but I'm trying. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  She is the first black actress to play in Wicked Alphaba. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=153.48s)]
*  So she plays Alphaba in Wicked. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=157.16s)]
*  What? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=158.8s)]

*  Alright, yeah so. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=167.56s)]
*  And also, like I said, Lyncia, she was the first black actress to play Alphaba on Broadway [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=168.56s)]
*  so we'll talk to her. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=173.04s)]
*  I got the chance to take the kids to see that and it was amazing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=174.04s)]
*  Alright? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  We got the show cracking, we got front page news. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=177.12s)]
*  Morgan will be joining us so don't go anywhere. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=178.84s)]
*  It's the Breakfast Club, good morning, let's go. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Morning everybody, it's DJ NV Jessalaria, Charlamagne the guy, we are the Breakfast Club. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=182.28s)]
*  Let's get in some front page news. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=187.72000000000003s)]
*  Morning Morgan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=190.68s)]
*  Hey, hey NV. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=192.44s)]
*  So look, you know you like to start with sports so you heard about what happened with New [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=193.44s)]
*  York Knicks coach. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  Yes, Tom Thibodeau. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so he got fired after five seasons. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  So the team announced on Tuesday that Thibodeau led New York to its first Eastern Conference [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=202.44s)]
*  Finals appearance this year. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=207.2s)]
*  For the first time of course since 1999 in the 2000 season. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=209.64s)]
*  In his five seasons with the Knicks he won 226 regular season games and the team went [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=214.24s)]
*  24 and 23 and four postseason appearances. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=219.0s)]
*  Now the 2021 NBA coach of the year led the Knicks to consecutive 50 plus win seasons [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=222.04s)]
*  for its first time since the 1990s. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=227.16s)]
*  Now Thibodeau has been an NBA coach since 2010 between New York, the Bulls, Chicago [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=229.8s)]
*  Bulls and the Minnesota Timberwolves. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  So what do you think about this move? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=236.72s)]
*  I think it was needed although Thibodeau was probably the most winningest coach since 1999. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=238.8s)]
*  I just feel like there was a lot of things that he did that he was exposed during these [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  playoffs that I think should have been handled a lot better. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=248.16000000000003s)]
*  For instance, the first game versus the Pacers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=250.84s)]
*  I mean we were up 14 with like what a minute and change left. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=253.0s)]
*  There's no way we lose that game. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=255.72000000000003s)]
*  He's still been real critical of the fact that he plays his players a lot. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=259.04s)]
*  His players get a lot of minutes and a lot of times that runs the players down. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  They don't have enough energy to close out. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=265.72s)]
*  So he's been, they criticized him a lot. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=267.72s)]
*  So I don't know who they bring in. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=270.48s)]
*  Thibodeau, like I said, he was the winningest coach since 1999. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=271.92s)]
*  He got us further than any coaches got us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=275.8s)]
*  So we'll see what the Knicks have in store as far as who's next. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=277.88s)]
*  All right the building blocks. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=281.20000000000005s)]
*  We love to hear it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=282.36s)]
*  Moving on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=283.36s)]
*  So Elon Musk criticism of President Trump's so-called one big beautiful bill is being [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=284.6s)]
*  downplayed by the White House. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=289.04s)]
*  Yesterday in multiple posts on X, Musk said, quote, I am sorry, but I just can't stand [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=290.88s)]
*  it anymore. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  This massive outrageous pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  Shame on those who voted for it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=301.32s)]
*  You know you did wrong. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=303.04s)]
*  You know it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=304.32s)]
*  Now he went on to post that it will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=305.32s)]
*  to 2.5 trillion. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=309.5s)]
*  He also said it will American, it will burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=312.0s)]
*  debt. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  And he went on to add that Congress is making America bankrupt. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  Now White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt addressed the criticism during a briefing [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=322.68s)]
*  and here's what she had to say. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=326.32s)]
*  Look, the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=328.08s)]
*  It doesn't change the president's opinion. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=331.76s)]
*  This is one big beautiful bill and he's sticking to it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=333.44s)]
*  So House Speaker Mike Johnson says Elon Musk criticism of the Republican Party's massive [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=337.18s)]
*  tax cuts and spending bill is very disappointing and terribly wrong. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=341.0s)]
*  Now Johnson shared that he spoke with the tech billionaire on Monday and told reporters [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=344.88s)]

*  Meanwhile, not all Senate Republicans are on board with Trump's so-called one big beautiful [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  bill as well. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X that she didn't know about the part of the bill that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  strips the state's rights to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years, adding that she [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=368.68s)]

*  Now Kentucky Senator Rand Paul says he's a no unless the bill is changed to cut down [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=379.88s)]
*  the deficit more. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=384.68s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=385.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, I think there are three or four of us. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  If there are four of us who want it to be more fiscally conservative, I think we can [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=389.72s)]
*  reduce the spending levels and perhaps separate out the debt ceiling as well. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=393.64s)]
*  But it takes four people with courage and four people with courage can make the bill [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=398.16s)]
*  into anything we want it to. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=401.56s)]
*  He also posted on X that we can and must do better. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=404.0s)]
*  And Utah Senator, also Republican, Mike Lee wrote the Senate must make this bill better. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=407.6s)]
*  Again, the multi-trillion dollar tax and spending package narrowly passed the House and Senate [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=413.92s)]
*  and is taking and the Senate is taking up the measure this week where Republicans can [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=418.76s)]
*  only afford to lose three votes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=422.48s)]
*  Now, Trump went after Paul on social media posting that he has very little understanding [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=424.92s)]
*  of the bill. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  Democrats say the bill cuts Medicaid and other social safety nets by billions of dollars. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=430.52000000000004s)]
*  And Republicans are saying there are much needed reforms to the bill and that it will [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=435.12s)]
*  cut the deficit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  Of course, we the American people are waiting to see what Congress is going to do. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=440.16s)]
*  There's a projected July 4th deadline to get this measure passed and on the president's [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=444.64s)]
*  desk. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  So I do like the fact that he did check the president or he's not. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  I shouldn't say check the president, but he's going against the president, right? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=452.92s)]
*  Because everybody's saying everybody on the president's team rides with him and dies with [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=455.48s)]
*  him and whatever he says goes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  And he's saying, I don't like this bill. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=460.0s)]
*  And it's weird that he's not riding for the bill because it seems like the bill is beneficial [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=461.72s)]
*  to a lot of millionaires and billionaires. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  So the fact that he's saying he doesn't like the bill, it makes me smile a little bit because [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=468.04s)]
*  he's going he's going against what, you know, what people are assuming or think that he [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  would go for. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=476.64s)]
*  He just spent 130 days, you know, thinking that he's just rooted out waste, fraud and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=477.64s)]
*  abuse. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=481.16s)]
*  So I'm sure he felt like he wasted his time. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=482.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=483.68s)]
*  You know, so but that's your 6 a.m. front page news at 7 a.m. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=484.68s)]

*  This one's for you too. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=630.56s)]
*  Anyway, Envy, shame on you for agreeing with this firing of Tom Tiptoe, one of the best [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=631.56s)]
*  coaches the NBA has right now. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=638.56s)]
*  It was not coaching. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=640.56s)]
*  It was the players and Carl Anthony Towns making stupid fouls. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=642.56s)]
*  Really, it was a whole, your whole squad making silly fouls, stupid mistakes, and just, it [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=646.56s)]
*  was not, it was not coaching. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=653.56s)]
*  Tom Tiptoe was solid. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=655.56s)]
*  He was a great coach for the boys, great coach for the Knicks, probably one of the best coaches [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=656.56s)]
*  the Knicks ever had, and firing him is putting y'all in the wrong direction. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=660.56s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=665.56s)]
*  I can't believe you would agree. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=666.56s)]
*  The first game at a pace is, you believed we up 14 with a minute and change left. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=667.56s)]
*  Were we supposed to lose that? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=671.56s)]
*  No, y'all shouldn't have lost that, but it wasn't coaching. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=672.56s)]
*  That was definitely coaching. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=675.56s)]
*  You can't blame Cat for 14 points. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=677.56s)]
*  And then also, the fact that he plays the players the most in the league, and the players [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=679.56s)]
*  seem like they burped down at the fourth quarter. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=683.56s)]
*  You don't think that's strange either? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=685.56s)]
*  Okay, but y'all think your bench could have picked up the slack? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=686.56s)]
*  I think if the bench was played the right way, I think they would definitely help. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=689.56s)]
*  I mean, you look at the last couple of games, a lot of the players on the bench, I ain't [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=694.56s)]
*  even know their names until the last couple of games. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=697.56s)]
*  I'd be like, who the hell is that? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=699.56s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=701.56s)]
*  I mean, because they just never played. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=702.56s)]
*  But, you know, we'll see what happens. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=704.56s)]
*  Who said I'm not playing? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=705.56s)]
*  No. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=706.56s)]
*  Like, this is crazy. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=707.56s)]
*  This is not going to get y'all back into the finals. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=708.56s)]
*  So, I guess, man, but yeah, I just don't think, I don't agree with this fire. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=710.56s)]
*  I respect Jibs. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=715.56s)]
*  He was a great coach for Bulls. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=716.56s)]
*  He's a great coach for the Knicks. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=717.56s)]
*  I just don't think this is a good move for the Knicks, but that's all I wanted to say, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=718.56s)]
*  man. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=723.56s)]

*  So wait, let me just tell you real quick. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=799.56s)]
*  I've been so blessed since I've been on the Bruffix Club. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=801.56s)]
*  You know, people come up to like me and be like, yo, you're like Bruffix Club Stacey. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=805.56s)]
*  So yo, thank you so much for giving me that opportunity to meet y'all. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=810.56s)]
*  I didn't realize how tall you was and I didn't realize how short Charlamagne was. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=815.56s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=820.56s)]
*  That's what people usually say. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=821.56s)]
*  But your cupcakes have like one of them had a little liquor in it. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=823.56s)]
*  So I was scared to bring it home because I want the kids to take the one with the liquor in it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=826.56s)]
*  And then I'd be on the news and then I got to blame Stacey. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=830.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no, right. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=832.56s)]
*  But that's why I explained all the flavors to y'all. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=834.56s)]
*  Just hilarious. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=837.56s)]

*  You didn't get to experience Stacey's cupcakes. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=840.56s)]
*  I'm so mad too. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=843.56s)]
*  You're going to come back up. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=844.56s)]
*  You're going to spend a bit and come back up here. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=845.56s)]
*  I need to meet you too. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=847.56s)]
*  Yeah, of course I will. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=848.56s)]
*  Just let me know when you had an edible stuff too. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=849.56s)]
*  Yeah, he had an edible stuff. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=852.56s)]
*  How did you like the jello shot? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=853.56s)]
*  Oh, I took my jello shot on the way in the court. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=856.56s)]
*  It was great. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=858.56s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=859.56s)]
*  But he had the edible stuff and I was like if Jess was here, she would have wanted the edible stuff. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=860.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, she know me. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=865.56s)]
*  I definitely would want some edible. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=866.56s)]
*  Charlamagne will be here in a second. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=867.56s)]
*  Okay, so look, Jess, whenever you're ready, because you know I'm up in the kitchen right now baking. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=869.56s)]
*  So whenever you ready, I would love to bring you something because I was so mad. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=874.56s)]
*  Like, yeah, I'm like, what the? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=879.56s)]
*  Oh, I can't. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=881.56s)]
*  You can say what the hell. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=882.56s)]
*  But you did leave her cupcakes in the fridge and we ate her cupcakes and Jess wasn't there. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=883.56s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=888.56s)]

*  Jess, I'm so sorry. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=891.56s)]
*  Oh, oh, wait. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=893.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=895.56s)]
*  One more thing. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=896.56s)]

*  Wow. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=916.56s)]
*  You know what? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=917.56s)]
*  He did give edibles, but I wasn't sure because he makes them at the crib. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=918.56s)]
*  So he don't know how much, how strong it is. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=921.56s)]
*  So I wasn't messing with edibles. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=924.56s)]
*  I figured I'd let you try it first. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=926.56s)]
*  Damn, hey, yo. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=927.56s)]

*  verse that we've not heard but you know that the Def Jam was scared to allow [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1092.48s)]
*  him to put out allegedly and that's the whole reason behind this but Stephen [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1098.08s)]
*  Victor who is manager to Pusha T he also he's worked with a ton of artists but [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1102.12s)]
*  manager to Pusha T spoke to Billboard after that article release and got into [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1106.8s)]
*  some more details and he revealed that it wasn't just like they released him and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1110.6s)]
*  you know they had this part in conversation Def Jam actually he [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1114.96s)]
*  alleged Def Jam said that they needed $200,000 or something like that in order [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1119.08s)]
*  for Pusha T to be able to in the clips to be able to walk away from it [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1124.6s)]
*  thousand million they said they thought in that article they said they thought [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1128.28s)]
*  it was gonna be like something like that but they was like no it's gonna be [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1133.76s)]
*  million I think what they were 200 thousand they would have got there to [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1136.8s)]
*  get that I was definitely the article they said it was millions of dollars [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1140.96s)]
*  it wasn't 200,000 I don't even see millions in here y'all sure y'all read the article? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1144.4s)]
*  it wasn't 200,000 that changes the whole look right here Pusha and [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1150.2s)]
*  Maddless would have went in their back pocket for 200,000 that's that they was [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1157.96s)]
*  millions I thought it said seven figures yeah the headline literally is Sean [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1160.92s)]
*  Victor on the insane amount of money it took to push T. But I'm talking about the actual number scroll down to the [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1164.2s)]
*  question where they asked where he says you should have did all this research [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1169.3200000000002s)]
*  before you started doing it later. I did do it I just I literally just read it again [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1172.2s)]
*  before I came up and I just searched the word million yeah they didn't say the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1175.92s)]
*  number but they said millions it wasn't no 200,000 yeah I literally just read [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1181.0s)]
*  this twice now I'm gonna find the exact line because so you had to pay seven [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1184.56s)]
*  figures to get out of the deal yeah that's millions oh I didn't see that sorry [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1188.16s)]
*  but he said that he thought it was gonna be like two they thought it was gonna be [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1192.4s)]
*  like 200,000 or something because there was like three he said even didn't really [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1195.92s)]
*  want to get into it but but he said that he thought that it was gonna be like [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1198.88s)]
*  three albums that they owed and they were trying to get out of it by just [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1201.8799999999999s)]
*  being like okay we released this new project can y'all take profit from the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1205.24s)]
*  new project and we'll give y'all you know this right here what we have right [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1209.1599999999999s)]
*  now and they were like no we want our money we want it now so they went to Jay [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1211.8799999999999s)]
*  Z and told Jay Z what was happening and I look here's a situation we're in we [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1215.52s)]
*  need to figure this out it already had a relationship so Jay Z was like well you [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1220.04s)]
*  just made my day like what do we need to do to get it done and they got it done [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1223.12s)]
*  and they were able to come over but another part of this article that I [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1225.8s)]
*  thought was important was that basically you know how when Drake dropped the [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1229.52s)]
*  lawsuit and was claiming all these things against Universal right and [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1232.52s)]
*  everybody including Charlamagne and us here in the room were like we're sure [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1234.72s)]
*  that these are things that the label has done to protect you at one point right [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1237.76s)]
*  he is alleging a lot of things but a lot of what Pusha T and Steven Victor are [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1242.04s)]
*  saying in their articles is what Drake is saying Universal Music allegedly has [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1246.28s)]
*  done to him when it comes to Kendrick Lamar like Pusha T says that there was [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1251.56s)]
*  in Steven Victor went in more detail about songs that were beat that was [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1254.6s)]
*  supposed to be released a song that was supposed to be released with a pop smoke paranoia and then [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1257.92s)]
*  there was another song Rick Ross a song with Rick Ross on Maybach music on one [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1261.96s)]
*  of the Maybach music installations and Pusha T's verse was removed from both of [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1266.0800000000002s)]
*  these because they thought that it was a shot at Drake and Steven Victor is like [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1270.44s)]
*  it wasn't they just interpreted it that way and they came to me because Steven [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1275.96s)]
*  Victor was also pop smoke released through him and was like look if he [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1280.76s)]
*  doesn't smoke it up pops over his artist yes pops up with his artists and he's [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1283.84s)]
*  like if and they told him like if he doesn't remove these like lyrics or that [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1287.4399999999998s)]
*  you guys don't remove the verse deed this album's not coming out and wouldn't [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1292.52s)]
*  clear it so yeah they wouldn't clear it even Victor's like well what about free [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1295.8799999999999s)]
*  speech like how you and then even with this new project he was telling Def Jim [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1298.56s)]
*  like you guys can't keep doing this to push it he like you want him to think [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1303.1999999999998s)]
*  about what you guys are gonna think or what you guys are gonna interpret before [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1306.6s)]
*  he releases music that's not fair to him because according to Pusha T and to [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1310.24s)]
*  Steven Victor there's no direct shot at Drake on this song on this kindred in [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1314.44s)]
*  this Kendrick Lamar verse. Even if there was a shot at Drake who cares it's freedom of speech. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1319.52s)]
*  Like what happened to the days where you can take a shot at an artist and it isn't just a [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1323.2s)]
*  shot on wax on record? Well we've never seen an artist sue like this either. I would [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1326.2s)]
*  love to know the exact dollar amount that the clips and Pusha spent because [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1331.2s)]
*  they said it was you know seven figures. Does Def Jam even invest that kind of [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1335.4s)]
*  money into artists like Pusha T and the clips anymore? Like it often seems like [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1339.56s)]
*  those legacy artists don't get that kind of an investment so I'm just asking the [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1343.08s)]
*  day did they spend more to get out of the deal than Def Jam would [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1346.52s)]
*  actually have spent on them? I was gonna say that's a good question that's a [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1350.06s)]
*  really good question because I but I feel like the last mmm yeah that's a [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1353.3999999999999s)]
*  really good question cuz the last time that Pusha T released. How long they been with them? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1358.04s)]
*  I feel like the Def Jam. I don't remember the clips being with Def Jam. It was new. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1362.0s)]
*  I'm about to look at it. I feel like the Def Jam deal that they did was like a year or two. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1366.0s)]
*  But you gotta remember a signing bonus is it's also the money used for budget as far as [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1372.36s)]
*  producing and studio budgets. Are those high seven figures anymore? That's what I'm asking. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1377.44s)]
*  Because when I hear Stephen Victor them say it was a ton of money. I'm sure they gave [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1381.8s)]
*  clips a rack of money to sign and I'm sure they gave Pusha T a rack of money to sign with Def Jam. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1384.68s)]
*  In fact the article the Billboard article says we paid them the money an insane [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1389.04s)]
*  amount of money it wasn't like $200,000 it was a lot of money for an artist. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1393.76s)]
*  It was a lot of money for an artist to come up with they bought themselves out of the deal. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1398.56s)]
*  Yeah and they that sounds like a lot of money. The clips they were signed to Def Jam from 2001 [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1403.44s)]

*  Pusha T a rack of money so they had to pay that back and I'm sure. I didn't know the clip was on Def Jam that long. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1431.36s)]
*  I didn't either I thought that it was all new but we do switch speaking of big numbers [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1435.56s)]

*  It says according to hypebeast. It literally links who it attributes it to. It's not just a random AI [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1528.72s)]
*  overview. I don't think the clip's been there. I don't know how we did a billion downloads because we [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1534.56s)]

*  Let's get in some front page news. Now if you missed it earlier Morgan broke down that the Knicks fired [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1593.44s)]
*  head coach Tom Thibodeau after five seasons. It was five winning seasons but they feel like he [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1599.2s)]
*  wasn't a great fit. How do you feel about that? I do feel that Thibodeau I feel like he worked [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1604.72s)]
*  his players a lot. I felt like he didn't trust the bench. The game one where they lost the paces. I [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1610.4s)]
*  felt like that was a coaching problem. You can't be up 14 and lose with you know a minute and change [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1615.76s)]
*  left. You can't trust what you don't have though. Everybody said you can't trust the bench. If they [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1620.64s)]
*  had the bench players they would have been playing them. Like the Celtics can go nine deep. The [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1624.32s)]
*  OKC Thunder can go nine deep. The Paces can go nine deep. If you ain't got it you ain't got it. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1628.88s)]
*  It's like penis. Wow. I'm serious. Somebody tell you go deeper and you ain't got it to go deeper. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1633.12s)]
*  When you do see players on other teams and they're doing well and they were our bench players like [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1638.8799999999999s)]
*  Obie Toppin and even McBride it took them a long time to get him out. Toppin was young though and [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1643.28s)]
*  then that system. He's busting ass. He might not have been a system fan though. Yeah but they [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1648.8799999999999s)]
*  never even played him. Then you got that new white boy that's shooting threes like crazy. I don't [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1653.9199999999998s)]
*  know if he's white or what his background is. I can't even think of the man's name but he [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1657.36s)]
*  found out in the last couple of games that he could actually shoot. So we'll see what happens. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1661.1200000000001s)]
*  What's up Morgan? Well what's up is congratulations to y'all because apparently y'all [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1665.28s)]
*  acted. I mean you sad on one thing but getting one billion podcast downloads and counting. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1670.32s)]
*  That's something to celebrate right? Drop a clues bomb on yourself and big up yourself. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1675.84s)]
*  That's pretty dope. Shout to all the listeners for supporting, riding and listening to us. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1681.44s)]
*  If it wasn't for y'all we wouldn't be here. We appreciate y'all every day. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1686.0s)]
*  You know what happened. You reached a billion. Congratulations to the breakfast club. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1689.2s)]
*  In other news family members of the man charged in the fire attack on Israeli hostages supporters. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1697.44s)]
*  Excuse me in other news family members of the man charged in the fire attack on Israeli hostage [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1703.52s)]
*  supporters in Colorado have been arrested by ICE. Now Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1708.64s)]
*  said the wife and five children of Mohammed Sabri Solomon have been taken into custody to find out [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1714.16s)]
*  if they were involved or knew about the attack in any way. They are also being processed for [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1719.8400000000001s)]
*  expedited removal from the United States. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made the announcement. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1724.72s)]
*  Let's take a listen. Today the Department of Homeland Security and ICE are taking the family [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1730.3200000000002s)]
*  of suspected Boulder Colorado terrorists and the illegal alien Mohammed Solomon into ICE custody. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1735.8400000000001s)]
*  How do you hate people more than you love your family? Like if you got a wife and five kids why [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1742.96s)]
*  would you throw that all away just because of your bigotry and your prejudice towards another group? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1748.24s)]
*  I don't understand that logic. So this comes as Solomon is in the United States illegally from [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1753.84s)]
*  Egypt. He faces federal and state charges after at least 12 people were hurt in Sunday's attack. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1759.3600000000001s)]
*  Now police said Solomon dressed as a gardener to get close to protesters when he used a makeshift [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1764.64s)]
*  flamethrower and molotov cocktails on the crowd. Now this story does inspire me on a personal note [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1769.68s)]
*  to encourage everyone to check on their family and the mental well-being of those around you [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1775.2s)]
*  because if something like this can happen you could be considered guilty by association. This [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1779.6000000000001s)]
*  is crazy that the family is now being taken into custody as well and so I would think that [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1783.92s)]
*  ignorance's bliss era has left and you better know what you need to know. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1790.64s)]
*  Yeah and your actions always impact your family. I didn't know that they could do something like [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1794.0800000000002s)]
*  this go arrest your whole family because of you know something that you did because I don't see [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1799.6s)]
*  how they would be accomplices but yes what you do does impact your whole family in more ways than [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1803.9199999999998s)]
*  one. Yeah so you know check in with your loved ones y'all. Speaking of ICE the mayor of Newark, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1808.9599999999998s)]
*  New Jersey is suing one of President Trump's top lawyers over his arrest at an ICE facility [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1814.56s)]
*  last month. Now Raz Baraka filed the federal lawsuit against interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1819.12s)]
*  Alina Habba on Tuesday accusing her of defamation and false arrest. Let's take a listen to those [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1824.48s)]
*  comments from Raz Baraka. I was cuffed, fingerprinted, took pictures of twice, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1830.4s)]
*  once there and once in court for a classy misdemeanor which you send summons to people for. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1838.0s)]
*  You don't lock them up and take their fingerprints. Trespass is a state offense, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1843.6s)]
*  it's not a federal offense. These guys need to find out the law before they begin running their [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1847.84s)]
*  mouth about what is right and what is wrong. So just to note that trespassing can be a federal [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1852.72s)]
*  offense when it comes to when it involves federal property and restricted areas so I anticipate much [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1857.3600000000001s)]
*  of this court case will come down to whether or not Mayor Baraka had access to that ICE facility. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1862.8s)]
*  Now he responded to criticism of his actions by Trump administrator border czar Tom Homan saying [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1869.04s)]
*  he may have to sue him too and of course all of this comes as Baraka was taken into custody [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1873.68s)]
*  outside an ICE detention center when he and members of Congress demanded answers about the [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1878.64s)]
*  facility's conditions. He was charged with trespassing but the case was later dropped by [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1883.68s)]
*  Habba. A federal judge criticized Habba's office for the arrest during a hearing last month saying [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1888.16s)]
*  it suggests a worrying misstep. And switching gears the first black mayor of Tulsa Oklahoma [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1893.76s)]
*  is proposing a multi-million dollar reparations plan for descendants of the 1921 Tulsa race [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1901.8400000000001s)]
*  massacre. Mayor Monroe Nichols says one can only imagine what the Greenwood district once known as [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1907.52s)]
*  Black Wall Street could have contributed to the region had there never been a massacre and of [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  course he's looking to establish a private trust that would be used to provide scholarship and [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1919.44s)]
*  housing to the descendants of those impacted by the bloodshed. Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1924.16s)]
*  Imagine what it would have meant for outcomes for our children. Imagine what it would have meant for [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1929.6s)]
*  public safety and most importantly imagine the trust and faith we would have built in each other [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1934.8s)]
*  over these last 104 years. My office has been working alongside our legal department [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1943.2s)]
*  on the establishment of the Greenwood Trust, a private charitable trust that will raise and [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1948.6399999999999s)]
*  facilitate the investment of 105 million dollars in private funds along our road to repair, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1954.24s)]
*  restoration and life. So Nichols says the trust will not involve direct cash payments and the [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1959.52s)]
*  city council would have to approve the transfer of any city assets to it. The push comes just [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1965.04s)]
*  weeks after Democratic Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pennsylvania announced plans to introduce the [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1970.32s)]
*  reparations now resolution which calls for the U.S. to spend trillions of dollars on reparations [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1974.72s)]
*  for black Americans. I know we've had this conversation many a times of about what reparations [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1980.0s)]
*  could look like for black Americans. So that's your front page news. Y'all can follow me on [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=1985.76s)]

*  favorite shows of all time. Girlfriends. I fixed it immediately sir. You said Friends. I fixed it [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2016.3999999999999s)]
*  immediately. I was talking. I was by myself. My body was here. I ran up here and I just started [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2020.6399999999999s)]
*  saying stuff. And she's here to talk about Forever. Forever is a reimagining of Judy [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2023.84s)]
*  Bloom's 1975 novel Forever. You know I'm a huge Judy Bloom fan. So when two of my favorite storytellers [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2028.4799999999998s)]
*  come together Judy Bloom and Mara Brockie-Kill magic happens and that's what happened with Forever and [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2034.24s)]
*  we'll talk to her about it coming up next. Next that's right. So don't move. It's The Breakfast Club. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2038.48s)]
*  Good morning. The Breakfast Club. Morning everybody. It's DJ, Envy, Jess, Hilarious, Charlamagne, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2042.24s)]
*  the guy. We are The Breakfast Club. Lala Rosa is here as well and we got a special guest in the [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2050.64s)]
*  building. The legendary. That's right Miss Mara Brockie-Kill. Welcome. Thank you. Good morning. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2055.04s)]
*  Good morning. Nice to be here. How are you? Less black and highly faded. How's your energy? It's great. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2060.8s)]
*  I'm really I'm floating. How does it feel to have yet another hit TV show? Another. Another hit TV [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2066.16s)]
*  show. But this is global. This is like the first time I have been on a stage this big. Normally my [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2074.16s)]
*  shows are on up and coming networks. So I feel like an ingenue actually. I feel both veteran and [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2081.04s)]
*  both. I'm also an off. You know, it's just an idea is a global conversation. That is kind of, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2090.08s)]
*  I'm sitting in that mostly my career. I've been thinking about a national conversation, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2099.36s)]
*  but this is a global one. And I mean, I've always known that our stories are global, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2104.56s)]
*  but for it to be a reality is pretty special. And another hit, right? To be at it. 30 years in the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2109.6s)]
*  game. 30 years in the game. I love it. Let's talk about it. Of course, for people that are [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2116.08s)]
*  just tuning in, you created shows like girlfriends, the game being Mary Jane, you've written on the [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2120.48s)]
*  Jamie Foxx show and so many others, but this one is Moisha. So many. So many. I see you. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2125.7599999999998s)]
*  This one's on Netflix. Yeah. Yeah. This one's on Netflix. Yeah. So how did the Netflix play [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2134.3199999999997s)]
*  come together? We're doing for a deal. You know, my career did garner me a really wonderful deal. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2139.68s)]
*  Out of that deal, I did stamp from the beginning. I hope you guys also that amazing doc documentary [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2144.56s)]
*  that Roger Ross Williams directed, but about Dr. Abraham Kennedy's work about the myths of racism. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2149.04s)]
*  That was my first offering in my deal. And this was the second. It was special from the beginning. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2157.04s)]
*  I met Judy Bloom, somebody else's come on, come on, come on. Two of my favorite storytellers. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2162.72s)]
*  I know. Come on. I mean, and that's God. First of all, I didn't even realize that the [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2168.7999999999997s)]
*  book was going to be 50 years old by the time we released. It was not even in my [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2175.36s)]
*  thinking of that time. Yeah. It came out at 75. Yeah. 75. It was a beautiful synergy. One thing [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2179.44s)]
*  I will say about Netflix when they're behind something, they are behind it completely supported, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2184.64s)]
*  resourced. I think that's what's important to me in this moment of this hit show is that it was [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2189.52s)]
*  my vision was supported financially. And it was amazing to feel like, wow, I'm supported, got money, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2196.56s)]
*  to have the vision that I want and to get the people that I need, the collaborators. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2204.7999999999997s)]
*  It's been amazing. You said Judy Bloom was your first permission slip as a storyteller. Oh my [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2210.08s)]
*  goodness. So how does your inner child feel knowing that you have done such justice to one of her [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2216.56s)]
*  iconic work? Why does my inner she feels on cloud nine. She is twirling. She is cartwheel. I used [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2222.0s)]
*  cartwheel back in the day. I could cartwheel, backbend, all the things. She's doing all of that. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2227.68s)]
*  I'm very proud of myself. When the opportunity to reimagine one of her books, there was no [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2231.92s)]
*  thinking. My hand just went up and I feel like it was a little protective as well. It was like, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2238.7200000000003s)]
*  I want to protect that story. I want to be able to tell that story. But my little girl is like, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2243.2000000000003s)]
*  she's cabbage patch. Does she feel like she made it? Do y'all feel like she's felt like she's made [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2249.12s)]
*  it a long while ago? I think this is different in that it's a full circle moment. I often say [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2256.96s)]
*  that you become a writer as a reader first. And so I used to get lost in the pages of Judy Bloom. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2263.2s)]
*  And so for me to be just the divinity of it, like the divineness of it, that I would come full [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2269.2s)]
*  circle 50 years later, like those kinds of things. It's almost like it was written for me. It was [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2275.04s)]
*  written for me and Judy. Matter of fact, I'm going to get a chance to meet her personally. I'm so [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2280.4s)]
*  excited. You're going down to Key West? Yeah, I am. You live this life once and I'm [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2285.52s)]
*  going to live in that dream. So I'm excited to meet her. We met at the time on Zoom and [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2290.8s)]
*  talked on the phone and emailed, but just to meet her and say thank you and have her sign my book. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2296.88s)]
*  I'm just that 12 year old girl is running to Key West. I've done it a couple of times. Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2302.08s)]
*  Just to go meet Ms. Bloom. Absolutely. Yeah. What I really would love is for people to honor more [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2307.92s)]
*  of their story, the craftsmanship sitting in the chair and writing. That woman sat in the chair and [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2314.88s)]
*  wrote, I mean, it's like she never got out of the chair. Just writing and that and what it would do, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2319.6s)]
*  just someone sharing a story, just my own testimony, is it ignited something in me. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2327.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think that even the feedback I'm getting from the show, not just the show, but the shows [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2332.48s)]
*  I've had in my career, it has ignited other storytellers. I want us to do more by that. We [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2336.96s)]
*  have so many stories in us that will die in us if we don't even start crafting them and writing [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2342.32s)]
*  them down. Her book is still through this show now is still, it still lives. It's universal. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2348.0800000000004s)]
*  It's forever. Ba dum bum. See what I did there? The original book was written in the 70s. Yeah, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2355.44s)]
*  75. Why did you choose to specifically set this story in 2018? Well, I had to look at what would [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2362.0s)]
*  make it fresh today and what to maybe have to look at what where the kids are today. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2369.12s)]
*  Judy and I talked about, well, they know a lot about sex, intimacy, connection, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2376.24s)]
*  those things. I think we're further away even though we're more technologically advanced. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2383.92s)]
*  We don't have, though these tools are meant to connect us, we are using them in very [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2390.0s)]
*  disconnecting ways. And I think that to bring the phone into the conversation, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2395.52s)]
*  it's an opportunity to talk about something unique to this culture. I mean, excuse me, culture, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2401.2s)]
*  but this generation, excuse me, what it is doing to them personally, emotionally, their emotional [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2406.08s)]
*  self, their, and then how it's even affecting their physical self and then affecting their future. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2411.68s)]
*  And that's what the book was about. How do we explore our emotional self, our physical self [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2416.88s)]
*  while maintaining a healthy future? I also want to talk about in the black family by changing the [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2421.76s)]
*  white family to black. It allowed me to also talk about a time that I think is very important for us [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2427.36s)]
*  to document between Trayvon Martin's murder and George Floyd's murder. We as black people, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2433.36s)]
*  we as black families, as mothers and fathers, we were screaming into a vacuum about the fear [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2439.84s)]
*  over our children. And there was no amount of fancy zip codes or education that can save your [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2445.44s)]
*  child. And that was scary. And I wanted, I needed a place for me as a mother to release all of that [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2452.8s)]
*  fear. And then also then look at how much we are out of love, but we are raising our children from [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2461.04s)]
*  that fear. And how that is hurting our children and their inability to have a natural right of [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2467.2000000000003s)]
*  passage to explore again, their emotional, their emotional self, their emotional maturity, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2474.72s)]
*  their physical self, their physical maturity to have sex or not have sex, who to have it with, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2481.2s)]
*  what's the right conditions, all of those choices that they're supposed to be making right now, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2486.7999999999997s)]
*  to protect a beautiful future. And that's another thing we need to open up some space because [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2493.7599999999998s)]
*  our children also need a future and it's tough out there. And I couldn't imagine being them today [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2498.64s)]
*  thinking about what do you want to be when you grow up? Well, what's out there? And so, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2504.64s)]
*  and we adults need to get it together. And so this is a part of my, my offering. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2510.16s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Mara Brock, a kill her new show, her new show forever is on Netflix [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2515.04s)]
*  right now. Lauren, back in the seventies, it was controversial because of the things that explore [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2520.64s)]
*  today is not controversial because we are so open, like what you talk about when you were crafting, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2524.96s)]
*  like what the storyline would be and how you would redo it, were there things that you were like, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2529.6s)]
*  I want to make sure I get to, or make sure I get in this storyline. Cause you also made it feel [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2533.36s)]
*  closer to home for like black teens. Like, you know, now forever feels like it's our story, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2537.52s)]
*  but you had to do it a different way. You know, I think it's controversial black male vulnerability. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2541.84s)]
*  It's just, there's no room for it. I think there's no images for it. And yet when I'm looking in the [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2547.92s)]
*  world and within my own children, their friends and the community beyond that, a lot of boys, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2552.8s)]
*  and more specifically black boys, they're not all that hard. You know, they don't have any room [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2558.88s)]
*  for their complexity. They don't have any room for their feelings. Like it's always funny to me, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2564.48s)]
*  especially about the group of boys that I'm around, they're all privileged. They live a great life. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2569.44s)]
*  Time to take a picture. They were laughing two seconds ago. You try and take the picture and [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2573.44s)]
*  then they get that stoic face. What you mean mugging for it? Like, you know, and you realize how [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2576.56s)]
*  much that's imparted on young black boys all the time about what is manly. What are those images of [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2584.08s)]
*  what a man is? I wanted to make room for their real reflection. I'm actually looking at the real [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2589.52s)]
*  thing. It's just what gets on that bigger screen and how important it is. I know we talk about [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2595.52s)]
*  representation matters. That's why it matters. You got to see yourself in order to decide, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2600.4s)]
*  is that beautiful? Is that how I want to look? You know, is that right? Is that tight? You know, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2606.48s)]
*  can't see it. And I think boys are getting their heart broken a lot sooner. I feel so bad for [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2611.44s)]
*  adjusting the whole time. Why? Because I just felt like a lot of times the characters, they were [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2616.96s)]
*  yearning for this space of like, I don't know, to just be okay and then things would be going good [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2623.04s)]
*  and then something else would happen. It'd be something small. It'd be like for Keisha, like [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2628.0s)]
*  the video gets sent to her phone and she's finally in this relationship. You know what I mean? Like [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2631.92s)]
*  things were just like happening. I'm like, they're not kids. Like why can't they just be [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2636.0s)]
*  and not deal with these things? It's life. Yeah, it's life and it's also technology. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2640.0s)]
*  Yeah. We didn't have, we got some freedoms without, you know, that they don't, they're not [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2644.16s)]
*  afforded. That's what I want to talk about. It's like, are we making any room for them? Like one [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2648.64s)]
*  of the things that I love when we, every production meeting, I said we're making an epic and intimate [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2653.28s)]
*  love story within a love letter to Los Angeles, right? And what that meant to me is that we need [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2658.56s)]
*  to see them in scope and scale and epic. I need to see them, their bodies in the space in Los [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2664.24s)]
*  Angeles. What that means is that they, it's a feeling cinematically that I'm making you feel [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  that they belong here and when they belong here, they belong to us. And so you will engage with [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2677.8399999999997s)]
*  our children differently, psychologically, emotionally. Those things are important in [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2682.9599999999996s)]
*  our image on the details. The details on anyone makes them feel more human to you. So I want to [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2687.6s)]
*  make just room for their humanity so that we think about the measures around technology. We [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2693.76s)]
*  think about what the rules are for these kids. I mean, like these kids are being told today that [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2700.2400000000002s)]
*  you make one false move, you won't get a scholarship. I mean, come on. It's the truth. They follow them [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2704.88s)]
*  for the rest of their lives. For the rest of their lives. There's no humanity in that. That's how I [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2708.7200000000003s)]
*  felt. Maybe that was the, at the humanity part, I'm like, yo, she's young. She made a mistake. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2712.32s)]
*  Now I was following her and it's like, he's in love and he just doesn't know how to navigate it. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2717.6800000000003s)]
*  Now he feels like he's not a good person or not a good person. He doesn't feel like he can win the [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2721.2s)]
*  girl in the beginning of things. And I felt bad for that. Like, but you know what? Back in the day, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2725.8399999999997s)]
*  back in the day, boys had to walk across the room to ask you to dance. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2730.08s)]
*  Had you ever, have you ever done that? Yeah. How did you ever get rejected? No. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2737.7599999999998s)]
*  No. Because I'll be honest, I only went when I knew I was going to be received. If I knew I was [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2741.68s)]
*  going to get rejected or there was a 50-50 chance, I wasn't going to try. Because remember it wasn't, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2752.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, back then it was a party and everybody standing on the wall. And you have, like you said, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2756.96s)]
*  you have to walk across. And if I knew this person wasn't feeling me, didn't wake at me, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2761.12s)]
*  didn't have a crush on me, didn't write me a letter, didn't hold us up. I wasn't going. But if I knew [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2764.56s)]
*  I got that little stare, that little smile, I was going to go. So it was just a dramatic [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2768.88s)]
*  experience. But see all of those social cues that you have to learn in real time, we're not learning [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2772.6400000000003s)]
*  that. There's no space for that. So I'm advocating for, I want the kids to be back outside. Like, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2777.84s)]
*  it's even sad we shot on Fairfax Avenue, right? It's a ghost town right now. But back in 2018, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2783.12s)]
*  where it was depicted, that was a place for them to be. But there's, we are, where are kids allowed [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2788.7200000000003s)]
*  to be. But that's why I love the scene. I love the scenes at Martha's Vineyard. I love the scenes [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2794.08s)]
*  at the prom. Oh God. Especially at the prom. Cause I feel like in that moment, Justin was, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2799.2s)]
*  you know, everybody talks about he's chasing the young lady. To me, it felt like he was chasing [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2805.44s)]
*  his blackness. Yes. That's what it felt like to me. Yeah. Thank you for seeing that. Yeah. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2809.68s)]
*  One of the things I was trying to say, trying to keep your son, trying to keep our children safe, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2813.68s)]
*  sometimes we're isolating them. He had a pretty prison, but it was up on a hill, isolated. And [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2817.36s)]
*  he's looking for more, but I can also understand Dawn. She's so scared to put them outside, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2823.52s)]
*  you know? Also scared. Is he going to measure up to where they are? You know what I'm saying? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2829.28s)]
*  She's probably not saying that, but that psychologically it's kind of, it's under there. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2833.44s)]
*  But fun fact, I was so proud as a producer to put all those black and brown kids taking over the [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2837.2s)]
*  Santa Monica Pier. I don't, you know, I found one of the location. I think that's, I think the last [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2845.7599999999998s)]
*  time someone took over the pier at that scale was Tom Cruise. I was like, okay, but that means [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2851.84s)]
*  something to me. That means something that we, how we take up the space, the epicness and the [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2858.2400000000002s)]
*  beauty of us. These, these kids are looking like this all over our country and we see it on [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2862.88s)]
*  Instagram or Tik TOK or things like, but to put it on that scale, that level of beauty, Anthony [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2868.48s)]
*  Hemingway directed his butt off in that, you know, the kids were just beautiful. The, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2872.96s)]
*  the, our costume designers are amazing. Our production design was amazing. Our cinematography [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2878.56s)]
*  was amazing. You know what I'm saying? We had the, we had the thing lit up. I was on cloud nine [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2883.52s)]
*  that day that we shot and we got out of there safe and sound. That's also important, but it's [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2887.76s)]
*  our kids having space in the world, chasing their, chasing themselves, figuring out who they are, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2893.84s)]
*  including of their blackness, including of their, you know, what they like, just who they are, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2900.88s)]
*  even the making room for. I know I get a lot of comments around, he likes Nartoe. Yeah. A lot of [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2905.12s)]
*  black kids love Nartoe. You know, we're a part of the world. So that was fun. And as much as it's a [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2910.16s)]
*  story about the kids, it's a story about the adults, right? Like, like the way Judy Blume made [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2915.44s)]
*  people feel seen at 13, it feels to me like you're making us feel seen at 40 something, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2920.56s)]
*  50 something. So what do those ages need that nobody's writing about? I'm going to keep saying [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2925.2s)]
*  this over and just more complexity, more, more of our human side. Like I don't, I, you know, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2930.0s)]
*  I've said before, I don't, you know, I don't really believe in positive images. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2937.36s)]
*  I think they can be just as damaging as negative images. What do you mean? Expound on it. Yeah, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2941.92s)]
*  break that down. Because so the negative image is a, is, is, is a product of, of a lie going back to [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2946.16s)]
*  the documentary. Like it's, it's the perpetuating the lies and the myths of us. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2954.48s)]
*  That's been out there. So a lot of black people want a positive image because they want to rewrite [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2960.8799999999997s)]
*  the wrong of somebody else's view of me. But what that does as an artist, it keeps me behind the [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2966.72s)]
*  eight ball. I'm chasing up and trying to clean up somebody else's mess. I'm from the Zora Neale [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2972.64s)]
*  Hurston school of thought. I know my people, I see my people. I want to be able to talk about them [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2977.2s)]
*  fully. And in the spectrum of our humanity, there is light and dark. We are not, we are not perfect [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2982.48s)]
*  to be perfect. That's just as hard to be perfect as it is to be bad. Like I want to be out the [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2989.44s)]
*  spectrum of my humanity. I want to be able to make a mistake and have my village patch me up and put [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2994.2400000000002s)]
*  me back out there. I deserve that. You deserve that. We deserve that. And so I want the spectrum [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=2999.68s)]
*  of who I am. And sometimes I'm, you know, sometimes I'm, I'm not great. And sometimes I am in the same [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3005.2s)]
*  day, in the same hour. And I deserve that, that sort of exploration of who I am as a human being. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3011.36s)]
*  And I give that to my characters. I think Dawn, for instance, you know, people, there's a lot of [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3017.6s)]
*  conversation about her as a mother, but that black mother has raised a lot of kids to get them, to [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3022.4s)]
*  keep them alive. Does she deserve looking at herself? Yes. Is it my, hi, my name is Mara [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3028.96s)]
*  Brock Akil and I'm a former Dawn. I put my pain on the screen. I think, you know, I wanted to, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3035.12s)]
*  out of love, I'm trying to overprotect my children. We're still kicking it with television [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3041.3599999999997s)]
*  producer, screenwriter, you know her from Girlfriends. And now she has her show on Netflix [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3046.3199999999997s)]
*  forever. Miss Mara Brock Akil. Charlamagne? What emotional space does Forever Occupy that none of [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3051.6s)]
*  your previous shows have? I think the cross-generational idea, I just think the complexity of family and the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3057.52s)]
*  and the generational connection and that I just really enjoyed that. I think also the scale, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3064.4s)]
*  emotionally, it allowed me to really scale us. I enjoyed that. And it, you know, the kids say, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3074.1600000000003s)]
*  take up space. It allowed me to take up space for us and for myself. Is Forever about love you've [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3083.84s)]
*  had, love you've lost, or love you still believe in? All the above. I believe in love. One of the [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3091.2s)]
*  things I'm really proud of with the ending, I know there's a controversy about the ending, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3096.8799999999997s)]
*  but what I love that Justin and Keisha showed us is how love endures and it shapeshifts. It's dynamic, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3100.7999999999997s)]
*  can change, but love can stay present. And they showed us how to let go and keep love in that [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3108.96s)]
*  ending. I think we could learn a lot from Justin and Keisha. You know, the question, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3118.4s)]
*  is this a forever love or the one you remember forever? And I would like to think that we, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3127.12s)]
*  as we move through our lives as human beings, that when we choose to use that word, right, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3132.7200000000003s)]
*  I love you, that you, there's a present, that you were so present and so loving that even if you [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3140.1600000000003s)]
*  don't last, the couple doesn't last, the love can last. It just, it might shift to, wow, it might [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3145.76s)]
*  just shift to we always just sort of text each other on each other's birthday. That you matter [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3152.7200000000003s)]
*  to me. You know, one of the fun things you realize when you're revisiting the work, especially as [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3158.1600000000003s)]
*  young people, oftentimes that's where our big dreaming happens. And those young loves that a [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3163.92s)]
*  lot of times the best part of you is packed in somebody else's memory of you. And so to have [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3172.08s)]
*  access back to those people actually is good for you to remember who you are when you lose your way [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3177.7599999999998s)]
*  and cause you don't lose your way. And so love holds you there. So it is about the past, the [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3184.96s)]
*  present and the future. And I think that love can take many different forms. You know, I, you know, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3190.3199999999997s)]
*  I have my young one plays baseball and I've learned a lot about watching him sit in the stands, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3195.92s)]
*  play baseball. Long days, long games, long games. But what's beautiful about it is everybody who [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3201.68s)]
*  walks into that batter's box has a different fight. So I often think about relationship, right? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3207.68s)]
*  Did you swing the bat? Did you have, they call it, did you have a good at bat? And sometimes you're [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3215.44s)]
*  at bat, you strike out, but you still had a good at bat. And I think that's what I think love is [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3221.2799999999997s)]
*  about. Are we having a good at bat? Are we swinging? Are we using our technique? Are we using [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3227.04s)]
*  all the knowledge we spent all week learning for this one to two times we get to walk in that [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3233.2s)]
*  batter's box and are we using it? Are we, do we, you know, do we, whatever the shoulders and the [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3239.36s)]
*  hips and all that guys, do we eyes on the ball, all those things, all those things you got to do with [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3245.12s)]
*  this ball coming at you 80, 90 miles an hour. That's love. And I think that I would like to [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3250.24s)]
*  think that we can all approach it at a good at bat. And you know what season two is going? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3257.9199999999996s)]
*  I have ideas. I still have to go through the process. You know, part of what I think another [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3266.56s)]
*  thing that makes me successful is how I honor my partnerships. And I come into it respectfully [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3271.04s)]
*  and really to also garner that energy back to me. But I have a concept of what I need to do. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3280.3199999999997s)]
*  I won't share it until my partners are signed off on it. But my next steps are me coming into a [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3286.08s)]
*  meeting ready to talk to Netflix around, hey, this is where I see it. And this is where I think it [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3293.6s)]
*  should go hearing their feedback, their concerns, taking that in consideration, sometimes debating [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3301.2s)]
*  it for a while, but finding a way to communicate why I think it's the way it should go. And if not, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3307.52s)]
*  where's the compromise in that? And I'm feeling good about the artistic flexibility that I have [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3314.96s)]
*  to craft story to figure that out. So I'm looking forward to that and success, especially. You know, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3321.12s)]
*  sometimes success can make people tighten up to playing with Mara. Yeah. Yeah. Multiple decades. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3326.56s)]
*  Okay. Screamer services, delinear television, give her what she wants, including the $50 million [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3334.2400000000002s)]
*  for girlfriends. We need closure. It's that simple. We've been talking about this. It's really that [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3339.44s)]
*  simple. And I'm excited. I think it's going to come. I don't know. I feel it. Like, I don't know. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3347.6800000000003s)]
*  Last time I was here, we talked about it. And I think what was beautiful in my journey at that time [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3352.56s)]
*  was for me to claim the value and understand the boundaries and understand what it is. I don't know. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3358.08s)]
*  Just I think. And also this success breeds more success. So I kind of feel, I don't know, I kind [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3364.24s)]
*  of feel like feeling I think it's time and a success girlfriend has had on Netflix. Oh my God. Oh my God. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3369.6s)]
*  Like they should see generational success. I watched that. I rewatched the whole thing with my mom. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3375.44s)]
*  And I was like, this is so different. But you know, it's fine. Finding out people are putting [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3380.16s)]
*  girlfriends on for their go to sleep. This is their, they call it their comfort TV show that [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3384.0s)]
*  they put on and they just let it run. And some people let it run while they go to sleep. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3388.96s)]
*  I don't know if people know, but nine 11 of this year marks 25 years of girlfriend, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3393.04s)]
*  25 years ago. This year, we need to make that announcement, right? It's time. That would be [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3398.8s)]
*  the announcement to make. Right. It has to happen. It's going to happen. I know it's going to happen. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3403.84s)]
*  Yes. Cause it's like the one black sitcom that we really did not get any closure on [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3408.16s)]
*  whatsoever. And there's so many loose ends to tie up. You know, it's really, it's not just loose [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3413.28s)]
*  ends. It's actually very relevant. I think it's a very karmic idea to have the show have a ending [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3417.92s)]
*  and a film. I just want to do a movie. Um, so you really, I know you do Charlene. You are very clear [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3423.92s)]
*  about wanting to see a movie. You are 16 years. He's been clear. I want to also say I'm always [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3429.84s)]
*  going to take a moment to say thank you because you also, that means a lot to me as a storyteller, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3436.8s)]
*  like, wow, that that level of impact on you. And even the fact that you, me and Judy Bloom [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3441.36s)]
*  are in the same thing. So I'm a thank you. Thank you. 16 years. Now you three, you want to, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3446.2400000000002s)]
*  are you going to go spend some money at the theater to go see a girl? I will walk to the theater. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3451.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm trying to be in the damn. I'm just doing a check. Yes. I agree. It gave us a lot to have [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3456.6400000000003s)]
*  a conversation about. And I think that's really where everything is at is communication, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3465.36s)]
*  have conversation, share ideas. We not all are going to agree, but I think we all get to know [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3470.08s)]
*  each other. Well, what do you want forever to give people permission to do? And that's my last [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3475.12s)]
*  question. I promise. Love. I want people to think more about love in every aspect of their life. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3478.0s)]
*  And actually even if we're older, that it's okay to want that, that first love kind of feeling, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3484.48s)]
*  like how, what do we need to do to get back to that first love kind of feeling? Um, I don't know, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3490.48s)]
*  I just think it's, I think as a human, a spirit, having a human experience, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3495.44s)]
*  dancing with love all the time has got to be our top endeavor. So that's what I want. Mara [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3499.92s)]
*  Brocker kill. Thank you so much. We love you. We value you, appreciate you and all your work. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3506.32s)]
*  That's right. Thank you. I really appreciate being here. Thank you. Breakfast club. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3514.08s)]
*  That's the breakfast club. Good morning. Morning everybody is DJ envy. Just hilarious. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3517.52s)]
*  Shalime, the guy we are the breakfast club. Let's get to the latest with Lauren. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3523.2799999999997s)]
*  She gets into somebody that knows somebody. I'm the home girl that knows a little bit about [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3529.8399999999997s)]
*  everything. She'd be having the latest on the latest with Lauren La Rosa. Sometimes you have [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3534.7999999999997s)]
*  details. Sometimes you have a little bit of everything on the breakfast club. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3542.64s)]
*  So there has been some more things with offset and Cardi. Offset has now deleted his Instagram [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3546.64s)]
*  and his ex account. His ex account currently pulls up as the, this account does not exist and you [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3556.08s)]
*  can't even go to his Instagram. So what happened was there's this photo, a side by side photo of [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3561.92s)]
*  offset sun, offset and Cardi, son wave and Stefan digs. And people began to point out, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3567.04s)]
*  this is an older side by side, but people began to point out that waves hair is braided very [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3571.92s)]
*  similar to Stefan digs. The only difference is the part in the middle and where that starts, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3578.96s)]
*  to be honest, but it is very similar, almost the same hairstyle. So people are, you know, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3583.84s)]
*  we're making jokes about it and they were, you know, saying, trying to make it seem like Cardi [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3587.84s)]
*  did this on purpose and just, it must have been a lot for offset. And I even must, it was a lot [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3591.84s)]
*  for offset because he actually responded to it. He said, now once he tweeted before he deleted [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3596.4s)]
*  his account, now when somebody died for playing with my son, then they're going to call me a [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3601.44s)]
*  crash out. I don't care how I look trolling with my kid ends bad. Then after this, he deactivated [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3605.76s)]
*  his accounts. Now following that, or previous to that earlier in that day, Cardi B actually went on [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3611.76s)]
*  Twitter spaces and she talked about just the fact that because she's now out and doing all the things [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3620.4s)]
*  with Stefan and she responded to the sponsor support conversation, men in particular are calling [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3625.76s)]
*  her a hoe and she's like, I don't understand why I'm getting all of this, like all of this smoke. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3631.84s)]
*  So let's take a listen to Cardi B on the trauma. She says she experienced at the hands offset. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3635.44s)]
*  Let's take a listen. Do not understand why I'm getting so much disgusting hate from men. I'm [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3639.6800000000003s)]
*  even, I'm even being called the it is so crazy. I don't understand how I was married for seven [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3646.5600000000004s)]
*  years and I was faithful for seven years. The constant lies, constant lies, the gas lighting, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3652.7999999999997s)]
*  it was really messing up in my head. It got to the point like last year, last year, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3659.4399999999996s)]
*  I really felt like I was going crazy. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. Like my baby came out five [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3664.3199999999997s)]
*  pounds. I was so depressed because the lies, the constant drama, I would wake up every single morning [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3670.7999999999997s)]
*  paranoid. If I, if I was still there, I was going to end up growing a jail because I was [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3678.0s)]
*  going to end up killing them seriously with my own bare hands. Cardi's not a hoe. No, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3682.32s)]
*  no, I should anyone be calling her that. No, I should anybody be hating on Cardi. I just think [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3688.0s)]
*  that us as men, we watching the situation and saying, damn, that hurts. We're sick. You know [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3691.84s)]
*  what I mean? We, we just as sick as probably offset feels when he sees it because she has moved on. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3697.84s)]
*  She looked damn good moving on and that's what you're supposed to do, right? Like, you know, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3703.6s)]
*  when you get out of a situation and it wasn't the best situation, you're supposed to be on social [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3707.36s)]
*  media looking good with your new boo. But boy, it hurts. Both of them got fans. You know what I mean? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3711.84s)]
*  So who is the one that's calling her a hoe? I mean, obviously are, are his fans, you know, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3716.4s)]
*  and imagine what her fans calling him. You know what I'm saying? It's, it's both sides. What they [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3721.04s)]
*  saying all said lost. That's the thing. Like, you know how they say W set in the chat. It'd be like [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3725.36s)]
*  L set in the chat. That's what they're saying. That's the reality of the situation. Yeah, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3730.08s)]
*  there's no hole. She's married for seven years. She moved on. She's dating somebody new and she's [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3733.68s)]
*  happy. She says she was depressed. She was upset. Now the fact that she's happy, I'm just glad that [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3738.4s)]
*  she's happy. It should just be a learning lesson for men more so than anything, because boy and [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3742.3199999999997s)]
*  women will move on and when they move on, they're going to look damn good doing it. And you're going [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3745.92s)]
*  to be sitting around doing what offset doing right now, tweeting his social media. She put up with a [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3749.6s)]
*  lot before she moved to like, she put up a whole lot, put up a whole lot before she moved on. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3755.04s)]
*  And then look what she even said. Our baby came out five pounds. She was stressed out and everything. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3759.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? So like that, that, that's crazy. That's crazy. But I am glad that he [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3763.2s)]
*  deactivated or deleted. Hopefully he can get some time for herself. He can think about it. He can, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3768.72s)]
*  you know, before he does, you know, do something stupid, he can, hopefully he's just unplugging [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3774.08s)]
*  and clearing his mind. Yeah. That's what I would tell offset too. Don't make permanent decisions [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3779.4399999999996s)]
*  based off temporary feelings. Don't crash out and lose your freedom because the internet playing, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3783.3599999999997s)]
*  because as crazy as it may seem now, this too shall pass. Yeah. Don't let the internet check [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3787.9199999999996s)]

*  road? The rock? Yes. And we didn't get a number two after that. We didn't get a third movie. We [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=3952.96s)]

*  I know Charlamagne got going to have some funny sweet s*** say out of his mouth. If you gotta say [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4004.16s)]
*  something you may not agree with, doesn't mean I'm mean. Who's getting that donkey? That donkey. That [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4007.28s)]

*  called the Defense Secretary, Pete Hegstaff. You know Pete Hegstaff, the same guy who was sharing [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4022.96s)]
*  details of a missile attack on Signal. Okay, I don't know why he just didn't download WhatsApp [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4027.6800000000003s)]
*  like the rest of us, but Pete Hegstaff, the man who provides the president with expert, okay, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4032.64s)]
*  and I put expert in air quotes, advice on national security and defense matters, is clearly bored. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4037.52s)]
*  Okay, there's a lot going on in the world that I'm sure he could be focused on, but yesterday [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4043.6s)]
*  we found out that he is focused on renaming ships. Yes, ships. Okay, Pete Hegstaff has ordered the [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4047.2s)]
*  Navy to review the names of vessels honoring gay rights activists Harvey Milk, Harriet Tubman, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4054.08s)]
*  and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Let's go to ABC 7 for the report please. The Secretary of Defense, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4060.08s)]
*  Pete Hegstaff, has ordered the Navy to take the rare step of renaming a ship. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4065.12s)]
*  The ship is named for murdered gay rights activists and Navy veteran Harvey Milk. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4069.6s)]
*  Military.com first reported the timing of the announcement during Pride Month is intentional. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4073.84s)]
*  Milk was forced to resign from the Navy in 1955 because of his sexual orientation. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4079.0400000000004s)]
*  The USNS Harvey Milk is part of the John Lewis class of oiler ships that are named after civil [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4084.2400000000002s)]
*  rights leaders. Okay, we all know that the Trump administration wants to purge all programs and [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4089.92s)]
*  policies and books and social media mentions of any references to diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4096.400000000001s)]
*  They are literally trying to erase anything they consider other out of the history books. Okay, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4102.48s)]
*  it makes no sense. What other reason would you have to not want a ship named after Harvey Milk [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4108.16s)]
*  or Harriet Tubman or RBG? It's just erasure. Nothing more, nothing less. And everyone just [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4113.5199999999995s)]
*  needs to call it what it is. By the way, none of those three people would be considered DEI hires. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4119.28s)]
*  Okay, they all earned their legacies. They all earned their reputations. Okay, the reason they [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4124.08s)]
*  have their names on those ships, the reason people wanted to name those vessels after them [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4128.96s)]
*  is simply because they're trailblazers who actually did things that people should recognize and honor. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4133.36s)]
*  And you want to erase that? Why? I need to see the signal chat about this, Pete. Okay, I need to see [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4139.36s)]
*  what your real reasoning is, not the politically correct reasoning you give into the media. Just [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4145.44s)]
*  tell us the truth because the truth is you want to erase the legacy of civil rights leaders and gay [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4149.68s)]
*  icons like Harvey Milk. In America, we cannot heal from what we don't reveal. Okay, hiding our [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4155.36s)]
*  history is just simply going to hurt our future. Now, Pete, you are the Secretary of Defense. Okay, [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4161.5199999999995s)]
*  focusing on your job is crucial for the safety of not only this country but the world. Every [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4166.719999999999s)]
*  American should be saying to themselves, hey, Pete, don't you got better things to be doing? Okay, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4171.679999999999s)]
*  Pete Hexf, you yourself just highlighted the threat posed by China's military buildup, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4177.2s)]
*  in particular concerning Taiwan. You could be focused on that. What about the ongoing conflict [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4183.28s)]
*  in Ukraine, Pete? You were absent at a recent NATO meeting on Ukraine and had people questioning the [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4188.32s)]
*  U.S.'s engagement in the conflict. Don't tell me you was absent from the meeting because you're too [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4193.92s)]
*  busy worried about ships being named after Harriet Tubman. Okay, Pete, Department of Defense has [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4198.24s)]
*  proposed significant budget cuts, which I'm happy about because anytime you want to talk about wasteful [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4203.44s)]
*  spending, you should start at the DOD. But if these budget cuts reduce senior military ranks by [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4208.0s)]
*  20% like they are proposing, then that could impact the military's strategic and operational [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4213.2s)]
*  readiness. And y'all definitely not going to be ready if the Department of Defense is too busy [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4217.76s)]
*  worried about renaming ships. Okay, Pete Hexf, I don't care what a ship is named when there are [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4222.08s)]
*  headlines in the Economic Times that read, World War III looms. Global leaders given two weeks as [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4228.32s)]
*  the clock ticks toward catastrophe. See, while we worried about the ditty trial, others are preparing [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4236.56s)]
*  for World War III. Okay, I was reading an article this morning. The headline was, Britain's biggest [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4242.56s)]
*  companies are preparing for a third world war as various conflicts threaten to erupt. Bosses are [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4247.68s)]
*  taking steps to ensure their businesses survive. The Deputy Chief of Russia's Security Council said [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4253.68s)]
*  last week, hold on, said last week, I don't remember everything. It was a blur. I don't think it was [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4260.24s)]
*  last week. Yes, but he said, and I quote, regarding Trump's words about Putin playing with fire [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4267.5199999999995s)]
*  and really bad things happening to Russia. I only know of one really bad thing, World War III. I hope [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4273.36s)]
*  Trump understands this. That was a direct quote from the Deputy Chief of Russia's Security Council [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4282.48s)]
*  and Pete Hexf, you worried about the name of ships? No, you're not. You're trying to distract [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4289.12s)]
*  from some of the things I just said. But what you will learn Pete, is truth is like the sun. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4295.28s)]
*  You can shut it out, but it is not going away. Please give Pete Hexf the sweet sounds of the [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4301.36s)]
*  Hamilton's. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4306.88s)]
*  So dumb. Beyond. It's a distraction though. Stay focused. World War III is apparently around the [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4325.76s)]
*  corner. I don't see that either. I hope we won't see that either. Others are preparing for it. So [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4333.28s)]
*  I think you just pay attention. Yes. All right. Well, thank you for that donkey today. Now when [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4338.5599999999995s)]

*  wiki. Congratulations. First and foremost. Thank you so much. I mean, it's a dream come true. It's [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4415.28s)]
*  like surreal sometimes. And sometimes I'm like, oh yeah, this is exactly where I always thought [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4421.12s)]
*  I would be doing something like impactful for our community and our industry. But most days I just [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4425.44s)]
*  like, I'm just dumbfounded. I can't believe I'm seeing these songs. What did it mean for you [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4432.0s)]
*  personally? And what did it mean for bro? Personally, it was an opportunity to tell the story of my [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4437.04s)]
*  community, our struggles, our strengths, our power for our, for our industry, for the entertainment [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4443.04s)]
*  industry. I think it just opened the eyes of who can do what and who is capable of what. And just [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4450.72s)]
*  like brought a more creative outlook to art. Now you were in Hamilton before, but I want to start [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4457.76s)]
*  from the beginning. My birth. Okay. How did you get into the arts? Like what was so special to you [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4465.28s)]
*  that this is what I want to do? You know, it's funny. I started at church and I hated singing. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4471.44s)]
*  My parents saw something special in me and kind of like thrust me into music and Ethiopia. Correct. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4477.759999999999s)]
*  Both my parents are from Ethiopia, immigrants, so I'm first generation. And I loved playing outside. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4484.32s)]
*  I love playing sports. I was super into my academics too. I was just like a really hype kid. I feel like [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4489.759999999999s)]
*  I was just, I couldn't be stopped. Perfect for Broadway. Lots of energy, especially for this [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4494.32s)]
*  role. But like being inside rehearsing and like, I just was like, I want to be outside and I want [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4499.52s)]
*  to be playing. But I started to see like how music affected people specifically in church and how that [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4505.6s)]
*  moved people spiritually. And I was like, wait, I think I'm good at this. Something. I don't know [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4512.8s)]
*  what it is. I don't know how to hone in on it, but I know that it just feels special. So I wanted to [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4521.68s)]
*  keep trying. And then I started doing like community theater and middle school and high [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4526.48s)]
*  school. And in college, I decided I wasn't going to study it. I had other interests. I studied [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4530.639999999999s)]
*  diplomacy and world affairs and undergrad and politics. All different angles to make like [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4534.48s)]
*  positive change to the world around me. And then you got to Broadway. So explain how you got to [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4540.32s)]
*  Broadway and those feelings. Midway through my five year run in Hamilton, the audition for Elphaba [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4546.08s)]
*  came up and I already actually had another job offer that I was very excited to embark on. And [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4554.32s)]
*  my team was like, I mean, it depends on what you want to do. And I was like, well, no black woman [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4560.32s)]
*  has ever played this role. I'm not going to pass up this opportunity. So auditions, it was like six [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4565.44s)]
*  rounds across maybe like four months of me flying to New York from LA on zoom, just lots of different [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4569.84s)]
*  it's a long process. And that's such a technical skill that is required for this character. So [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4579.4400000000005s)]
*  after all those rounds and the up and downs of the emotions, I got it. I don't, I got it. I don't. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4585.4400000000005s)]
*  Am I going to, I don't know, just like so much inner turmoil. I finally got the call from my agent [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4589.2s)]
*  and I started cracking up. I'd like, I couldn't even like emotes. I was just like, this cannot [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4594.24s)]
*  be happening right now. You thought it was a joke or you didn't know what you felt. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4601.28s)]
*  I think I didn't know what I felt. I was like in shock. Yeah. At that point, I think I had [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4605.52s)]
*  convinced myself that it was highly possible. I was, it was in the final, like four people, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4612.080000000001s)]
*  maybe that I was like universe, God, mother earth. I receive whatever is mine, however, I want this. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4617.120000000001s)]
*  And I feel like I would be great for this moment, but like, I accept the outcome. So I think I was, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4624.8s)]
*  I was playing both outcomes internally so well that no matter what that call would have, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4630.32s)]
*  what, whatever the outcome of that call would have been, I would have been ready. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4637.2s)]
*  So I think my body was like, okay, this is happening. I had to like go on a walk and like [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4640.0s)]
*  ground myself to remember what was real. I couldn't believe it. It's crazy. How many, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4644.96s)]
*  how many times did people try to gaslight you? Like is America ready for a black Elphaba? Like [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4648.8s)]
*  the damn green faces in fantasy enough. It's so silly. And it's, it, people say things like [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4652.5599999999995s)]
*  she's green. Like it doesn't matter what her race is. And I'm like, she's green. Exactly. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4657.92s)]
*  She looks different than everybody else. Like that is the point. So I do think the world was ready. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4661.76s)]
*  I do think the world was ready and I feel so grateful that it was me. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4666.08s)]
*  You know, it's only dressing. Like I took my nine year old and my six year old to see Wicked on [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4669.6s)]
*  Broadway and they saw the movie. So to them Elphaba is black. It's black. Like, like, like, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4673.28s)]
*  like if I say, if I say that to them, you know, she's black, right? Like, of course she's black. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4680.8s)]
*  Yeah. That's all they know is black Elphaba. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4684.96s)]
*  It's crazy that this generation gets to live in this, in this climate and see it as normal. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4686.5599999999995s)]
*  Like that's what they get to grow up experiencing. And that's my favorite part of this [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4694.24s)]
*  is this whole generation that is just, this is their norm. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4697.76s)]
*  Why do you think it took decades for a black woman to get this role full time? Like what does [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4701.04s)]
*  that say about Broadway? If anything? I think art is a reflection of the society it represents. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4704.16s)]
*  So I don't think Broadway was particularly doing anything outside of what our country represented [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4711.52s)]
*  and as times have changed, so has art, art has shifted. So I feel like it's exactly, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4717.52s)]
*  the timing is exactly right. And again, like, I can't speak to why it took this long, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4725.28s)]
*  but all I know is I'm happy I'm here. Do you get a lot of love or do you get a lot of hate? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4729.76s)]
*  I get a lot of love. I mean, haters are haters. There's always haters. There's always critics. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4733.04s)]
*  The reason I ask is like I took my kids to, and of course the majority of people in there [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4737.44s)]
*  are others. Or I should say a white. I was wondering, you're an other. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4742.799999999999s)]
*  I'm green. Okay. And what type of hate do you get? Is it letters? Is it, you know, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4756.5599999999995s)]
*  because I thought the play was phenomenal. And like I said, when I seen you in hall, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4762.48s)]
*  I took my three year old and then I took my 23 year old. And they both enjoyed it. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4765.44s)]
*  Across the generations, people relate. I mean, it's the hate. I don't know. I wouldn't even [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4771.04s)]
*  call it hate more than just like strong opinions because less so about race, more just because [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4775.759999999999s)]
*  this is a long running show, 22 years, everyone who has seen, who comes to see wicked has seen [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4782.5599999999995s)]
*  wicked more or less the amount of people who is, who are new to this piece of work is very little. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4788.32s)]
*  So everybody knows every word, every intonation, like every way, every single line goes or every [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4794.32s)]
*  vocal part goes. So it's not, it's less like why is there a black Elphaba? I don't really get that. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4799.84s)]
*  There's more celebratory energy about the racial thing, but people just like what they like. And [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4804.5599999999995s)]
*  you know what? That's fine. I cannot be for everyone. And I think that's what this show is [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4810.08s)]
*  teaching me, especially this character who has to fight with the world around her, not trusting her [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4814.32s)]
*  and misunderstanding her, but she always stays true to who she is. And that I think is my biggest [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4819.36s)]
*  takeaway from playing this role. We're still kicking it with Lyncia Cabetta. She's the first [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4823.36s)]
*  black actress to play Elphaba full time in wicked on Broadway. I took my kids there. Amazing show. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4826.96s)]
*  Jess, what was the most challenging part about playing Elphaba? If there are any, I would say a [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4832.719999999999s)]
*  mental and emotional fatigue. The show is very emotionally taxing. I am constantly faced with [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4838.799999999999s)]
*  the biggest, most complicated inner feelings that specifically a black woman can experience. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4849.360000000001s)]
*  Feeling othered, feeling misunderstood, not being trusted, disillusionment, believing in someone, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4854.8s)]
*  trusting in someone, and then realizing that it's not what it seems. So I think there's a lot of [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4861.280000000001s)]
*  times when I leave the show and I have to just, I don't even turn on the lights in my apartment [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4866.56s)]
*  for hours. I have to be dead in my head because it's just the emotional roller coaster of what the [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4870.080000000001s)]
*  character requires also requires me to plug in and charge when I'm not there. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4876.24s)]
*  Let's stay there for a minute. Because Elphaba is one of the most demanding roles in theater. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4881.5199999999995s)]
*  If not the most. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4885.599999999999s)]
*  So what's your pre-show ritual to get into that headspace and voice space every night? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  I think I definitely take stock in how I'm feeling. If I'm feeling more tired, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4892.0s)]
*  maybe I listen to hype music or take a walk or take a hot yoga class, something to get my energy [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4896.639999999999s)]
*  going. But if I'm feeling particularly stimulated that day, so when I was listening to jazz and [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4902.56s)]
*  something calmer, I usually do a 30 minute warm up, half of it physical, half of it vocal. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4907.360000000001s)]
*  And then while I'm getting the greening, which takes 30 minutes to do my makeup every day, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4913.68s)]
*  when they're doing that for me, that's when I play music. And music I feel like is what [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4918.080000000001s)]
*  drops me into whatever emotional space I need to get into the character. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4923.200000000001s)]
*  Makeup only takes 30 minutes? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4927.04s)]
*  30 minutes. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4928.96s)]
*  Damn, I expected more. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4929.84s)]
*  People usually think it takes hours. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4932.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably just do your face, neck and hands, right? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4934.080000000001s)]
*  Right, and a little bit down my back. But it's only a little bit down my arms. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4936.8s)]
*  Do you have a life on Broadway? Can you have a life on Broadway with the amount of shows that [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4941.76s)]
*  you shoot? Are you compressing? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4945.6s)]
*  Eight a week. We have one day off yesterday. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4947.84s)]
*  I could say you can have a life on Broadway when you're Elphaba, though, which is a different beast. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4950.080000000001s)]
*  There is no life. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4955.76s)]
*  This is very difficult. I think I try. I'm a communal being. I need the energy of others. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4956.88s)]
*  So I try to balance it. But most states, I do spend chilling on my own. Because like I said, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4963.2s)]
*  the mental toll is really, I really have to like relax in order to bring my like whole heart and [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4969.4400000000005s)]
*  soul emotionally to the character. So everybody has a life, but I have less of a life. But you [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4974.8s)]
*  know what? Sacrifice is worth it. Let me tell you, it is worth it. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4980.64s)]
*  What's harder? Hitting that defying gravity note eight times a week or carrying the weight [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4983.76s)]
*  of representation every time the curtain comes up? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4988.64s)]
*  Ain't that the question? Definitely the representation. It's just, it means so much [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4991.360000000001s)]
*  to so many people. And like, I think another back to what you were saying about the hardest [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=4998.08s)]
*  parts of the role. Like, I put a lot of pressure on myself to make every interaction I have through [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5001.52s)]
*  this period of my life has something meaningful to audiences, black, brown, white, it don't matter. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5006.8s)]
*  Like, I just, I think that that opportunity can sometimes feel like pressure to me just [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5011.2s)]
*  because I care so much. I really want all like, especially the kids, I want kids to go away [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5018.16s)]
*  feeling empowered. So defying gravity is like, it's like a science is like, this is how you sing it [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5022.24s)]
*  is vocal technique. But with the cultural, racial, emotional aspects of it, like those, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5028.48s)]
*  things take real care. And I really put a lot of effort into how I present myself and what I share [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5036.719999999999s)]
*  with my community. So you feel actual pressure to represent? I do feel pressure in that. I feel [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5042.48s)]
*  like it's more self induced, just because like I said, I care so much about positively impacting [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5049.679999999999s)]
*  the world around me. And that's, I feel like that's been one of my dreams since I was a kid. Like, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5056.639999999999s)]
*  I never knew what I would do growing up. But like, that's kind of why I went into politics for a [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5059.44s)]
*  little while too, and still have a passion for it is that I care so much about just like positively [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5063.12s)]
*  inspiring people. So yeah, I do feel pressure only because that's what I choose to care about. I don't [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5068.72s)]
*  think anybody puts it on me besides myself, which is why this role teaches me to stay, you know, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5072.96s)]
*  connected and true to who I am, regardless of what's happening around me. Because I feel like if [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5079.36s)]
*  you just bring your full self to the role, that's enough. That's enough. I completely agree. And [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5083.36s)]
*  that's exactly what the character does. She brings herself to all these crazy life situations. And [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5088.32s)]
*  that's how she survives and thrives. Have you met Cynthia Arrevo? I haven't met her yet. She did [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5094.5599999999995s)]
*  send me flowers on my debut, my first show, which was sweet, but I think we should probably be doing [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5100.32s)]
*  some stuff soon. How do you navigate being celebrated, but still feeling like you're breaking [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5105.759999999999s)]
*  through systems that weren't designed for you? I celebrate myself because what I'm doing is [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5111.6s)]
*  a literal revolution. And I believe art is a part of social change and political growth. I believe [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5119.200000000001s)]
*  art shapes culture and culture shapes art. It's sort of symbiotic in that way. So I feel like the [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5129.68s)]
*  fact that I have the opportunity to break through these barriers also like strengthens my relationship [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5135.68s)]
*  with myself. I'm like, yeah, you did that. Who was your Elphaba growing up? Who made you believe [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5140.8s)]
*  you could defy gravity? That's a great question. I would say seeing Cynthia for sure. I mean, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5146.4800000000005s)]
*  Cynthia has done so many amazing projects, which inspire me endlessly. Audra McDonald, also how she [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5154.4800000000005s)]
*  has crossed over to different industries, within the entertainment industry. So seeing black women [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5164.24s)]
*  be sort of like multi hyphenated artists inspired me so much. It made me feel like if they can do it, [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5170.0s)]
*  you know, I can too. Are you and Cynthia going to do anything together at the Tony Awards? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5176.4s)]
*  Because you said you're going to do something. I pray, honey. That's what I am asking the universe [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5180.8s)]
*  and doing all the networking I can. She's hosting this year, right? She is hosting. I pray. I pray. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5184.88s)]
*  So if anyone can hear me, bring me to the Tony's. I would like to be in attendance. I think it would [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5190.0s)]
*  be really great for our community. You haven't been nominated yet? I can't be nominated for Wicked [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5195.52s)]
*  because it's not a new show in this season. I didn't know that. Yeah, that's a thing. That's crazy. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5200.160000000001s)]
*  But if you're an actress or actor that takes the role to another level, what have you done? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5206.56s)]
*  Well, thank you. One. Two, I agree. I do think that long running show should have the opportunity [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5210.88s)]
*  to award, you know, particular performances in that way. But from my knowledge of how it works, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5214.72s)]
*  it's about the new works of that season. There's like a maybe, you know, September of the last [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5220.96s)]
*  year till March of the current year, some timeline that the show has to open from one end to soon. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5226.08s)]
*  So the first week, your first week on Broadway, after you realized, OK, this is really eight [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5231.92s)]
*  shows. What was that feeling on that Sunday? You know, this is probably going to be surprising to [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5237.04s)]
*  you, maybe. But I was like, no, I got this. I was like, I was so concerned with my ability to [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5243.6s)]
*  sustain this. And I was wrong for doubting that. I really was. I finished the week and I was like, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5252.72s)]
*  look, it's a lot of work. I'm tired. My body's tired. My voice is tired. My mind is tired. But [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5259.280000000001s)]
*  like, I'm equipped. I feel like I've had a lot of work experiences that I've built me [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5263.280000000001s)]
*  to be able to sustain this. And like, my body is strong. So long as I take care of her, she serves [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5269.84s)]
*  me. So I finished that week and I was like, so impressed with my own ability, to be honest. I [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5273.84s)]
*  was shocked. I was shocked. The right person got the job. Thank you. You all are amazing. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5279.84s)]
*  You keep killing it. Like I said, my family loved it. We had a great time. Candy was expensive. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5284.4s)]
*  I ain't go front. My kids wanted every piece of candy. No, nine dollars. But regardless, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5289.28s)]
*  because they know the kids will eat the snacks. So they will charge them. That's right. But they [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5292.96s)]
*  had a great time. Loved it so much. Thank you so much, man. My pleasure. Thank you. You gotta [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5296.48s)]
*  go check it out. I am. I'm the only one who has not seen it. I am coming. I know about you. So I'm [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5301.2s)]
*  like, I gotta come and support you. Appreciate it. Thank you. You're amazing. Thank you. All right. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5306.08s)]
*  Lencia. Lencia. Lencia. You got it. Last name? Cabetta. Cabetta. I was on that. He's still [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5310.959999999999s)]

*  Morning, everybody. It's DJ, Envy, Jess Hilarious, Charlamagne the Guy. We are the Breakfast Club. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5326.48s)]
*  Let's get to the latest with Lauren. Why aren't you coming straight back? She gets into somebody [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5331.679999999999s)]
*  that knows somebody. She gets the details. I'm the homegirl that knows a little bit about everything. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5337.5199999999995s)]
*  She be having the latest on this. The latest with Lauren LaRosa. Sometimes she have facts, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5342.799999999999s)]
*  sometimes she have details, sometimes she have a little bit of everything. But it's the latest. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5348.719999999999s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. Well, yesterday in the courtroom, a man named Eddie Garcia took the [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5352.32s)]
*  stand. So Eddie Garcia is the guy that I mentioned to you guys a couple of days ago when I said that [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5359.5199999999995s)]
*  somebody got on the stand, got their immunity and then was supposed to come back and testify, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5364.32s)]
*  but they didn't end up getting to him. So Eddie Garcia worked at the Intercontinental Hotel, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5368.08s)]
*  which is the hotel where the Cassie beating video went down. At the time of the video, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5373.12s)]
*  he was the security supervisor. So he got on stand and testified that they received $100,000 [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5378.88s)]
*  from Diddy to get rid of the Cassie beating video. That is what he alleged went down. He says that [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5385.6s)]
*  it was split three ways. It was split between one of his bosses at the Intercontinental who [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5393.52s)]
*  received $50,000. Eddie Garcia alleges that he then took 30K and he gave another one of the employees [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5398.8s)]
*  20K. These are all people who were involved and actually saw the video, erased the videos off the [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5406.08s)]
*  server. One of them is a manager who actually allegedly had the conversation in addition to [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5411.92s)]
*  Eddie Garcia with Christina Caron and Diddy. So the way he says this went down is he says one day he [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5416.8s)]
*  received a phone call and this was following the Diddy incident that happened on March 10th, 2016. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5422.48s)]
*  He says he got a phone call from a New York number and on the phone he alleges was Christina Caron, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5427.68s)]
*  who was an employee of Diddy's. At the time she was chief of staff for Combs Enterprises. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5432.64s)]
*  So he says on the phone she then asked him about the video, the security video. He says that she [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5439.360000000001s)]
*  claimed that Diddy was intoxicated at the time of the video and that he didn't remember the event [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5445.84s)]
*  whatsoever. So then she goes on and she's asking for the video to be deleted. Garcia is like, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5450.72s)]
*  I don't have any control over that. I can't let you see the video. I can't talk about things being [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5460.96s)]
*  deleted. I can't talk anything about this video. You have to speak to hotel management. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5465.5199999999995s)]
*  So then he says he was later informed that Christina Caron allegedly was in the hotel lobby [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5469.2s)]
*  looking for him and she was asking for the video. So he says that again he told her to talk to hotel [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5474.32s)]
*  management or that they would have to file for a subpoena, like something in court where they could [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5479.5199999999995s)]
*  get the video. So he does admit though that he told her like, look off the record the video is [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5483.5199999999995s)]
*  really bad but there's nothing that I can do for you. So then Eddie Garcia says that he later got [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5488.48s)]
*  another phone call from Christina Caron but at that time Diddy's on the phone. So when he gets on [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5493.28s)]
*  the phone, Diddy's on the phone asking to again get the video and he's like, you know, Diddy was [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5498.0s)]
*  nervous. He was fast talking allegedly but again he denied the request to give them the video. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5503.36s)]
*  After that phone call they then called him again but this time it was from Diddy's own personal [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5508.959999999999s)]
*  phone allegedly and Diddy was basically telling him like, look this video could ruin my career. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5513.5199999999995s)]
*  So Garcia's like, listen, I don't have access. Eddie Garcia's like, I don't have access to the [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5518.879999999999s)]
*  server anyway but if you, you know, want to make something happen my manager is a person that you [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5524.0s)]
*  would have to talk to and Diddy told him like, look if you can figure this out we'll take care [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5528.639999999999s)]
*  of you and Garcia at the time says that he interpreted that as, you know, a money offer. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5534.0s)]
*  So they then connect him or he then goes and talks to his supervisor, his manager supervisor [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5539.679999999999s)]
*  and this is a guy that he says name is Bill Madrano. That's the guy that got the 50k. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5544.96s)]
*  Now he says that when he talked to him his supervisor originally said, look I'll do it for [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5550.72s)]
*  $50,000. Just tell Diddy allegedly like, you know, $50,000 put me on the phone with them I'll take [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5555.28s)]
*  care of it. So he gets back on the phone with them. He says Diddy refers to the Madrano guy as like [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5560.56s)]
*  his angel because he's willing to do it. So then Eddie Garcia, they go and meet up with Diddy at [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5565.44s)]
*  this like a high-rise building in West LA. He says that Diddy's counting like money through a [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5572.0s)]
*  money counter and the money counter rang up $100,000. And he gave him the money. He says, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5576.4s)]
*  he said that Diddy said to him like, you know, be careful how you spend all the money or whatever, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5583.6s)]
*  but there were NDAs that were brought to him. Diddy allegedly also asked for their like IDs [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5587.76s)]
*  of everybody that was involved. Diddy asked allegedly if there was other videos on the [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5592.72s)]
*  server or if that was the only copy, if there was anything on the cloud. And he told him like, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5597.52s)]
*  you know, that was all that was there. And he says that Diddy, he alleged that Diddy actually [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5602.240000000001s)]
*  FaceTime Cassie and put Cassie on the phone. And she also allegedly confirmed that she did not want [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5607.360000000001s)]
*  the video to become public. She had a movie coming out and she just didn't want it to become public. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5612.56s)]
*  So, so question, what does this have to do with his case? Like what does that, what does this fall [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5616.56s)]
*  under like his racketeering or what charges does this apply to? I believe that this is going to go [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5619.92s)]
*  to him using money and his influence to be able to cover things up and move around. Like, so you [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5624.48s)]
*  have all the domestic violence videos which show the whole forced coercion and their legend. This [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5630.879999999999s)]
*  is why Cassie was scared to stay in a relationship. But then you have him, number one, if- [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5636.16s)]
*  Oh, so bribery. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5640.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, bribery. But also if you're, if you are knowingly, right, if this is proven that he did [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5641.44s)]
*  this, that means you knew you did something wrong. And then, and after you know you do something [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5646.08s)]
*  wrong, you then go and use your power, your influence and your money to then cover it up. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5650.48s)]
*  It's bribery. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5654.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5654.96s)]
*  I'm looking at it because it's bribery. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5655.28s)]
*  Didn't the guy ask for the money though? Did he just say, hey, I want the video deleted? And the [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5656.16s)]
*  guy said it'll take $50,000. So was that bribery if the guy asks? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5660.799999999999s)]
*  But prior to that, Eddie Garcia says, did he told him I'll take care of y'all? So he interpreted [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5664.08s)]
*  that as a money offer. And then there was the other hotel security guy weeks ago. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5669.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I'm looking at the New York Post article and the New York Post article says Sean Diddy [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5673.36s)]
*  Combs bribed hotel security. So if you look at the racketeering charge, bribery is one of the things. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5676.88s)]
*  When I hear Lauren explaining all this, I'm just trying to figure out what exactly does that have [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5680.8s)]
*  to do with his case and his bribery. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5685.2s)]
*  Yes. But so the bribery, the physical, because people keep, people are upset. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5686.8s)]
*  We know the physical because we saw the video. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5691.12s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm not saying that we know it. I'm saying people are trying to figure out [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5692.400000000001s)]
*  why do they keep even going back to this incident? Like why do you care to prove that there was money [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5696.0s)]
*  paid? Why do you care to talk about bribery? Because he's not being charged for domestic [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5699.84s)]
*  violence, but the bribery, the physical alleged violence, all these things are things that the [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5703.2s)]
*  government is saying this is an entire conspiracy that he uses his employees and his businesses [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5708.24s)]
*  to successfully do. And people are scared to get away from it. So in it, allegedly. So if they're [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5714.08s)]
*  scared, you can make them do anything. This is the same thing that Trump was convicted for, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5718.96s)]
*  like when he bribe old girl, the bribery, regardless. Yeah. The porn star girl. Yes. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5723.28s)]
*  And now the next question, then how did the video get out? Did they know how the video got out then? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5728.08s)]
*  Because if, if they wiped all the clouds and nobody else had a video, how did that video come out? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5731.679999999999s)]
*  So Eddie, Eddie Garcia says that one day they just saw the video in the media. He says that [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5736.24s)]
*  he got screenshots sent to him. They just literally, he said the video years later, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5743.84s)]
*  they just saw on a news outlet. One of the guys who was involved, who responded during the time [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5750.32s)]
*  of the actual incident, text them a screenshot of the video on CNN. And Eddie Garcia said when he [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5755.68s)]
*  got all these sex messages, he deleted all of the related messages because he didn't want nothing to [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5761.76s)]
*  do with it. But he didn't go into exactly how it made it. He just said it popped up on CNN. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5765.68s)]
*  They sent another hotel guard a testify that he recorded the footage on his phone so he could show [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5772.08s)]
*  his wife. That's the first guy we talked about a minute ago. That was the very first guy from the [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5776.64s)]
*  intercontinental hotel who's now an LAPD officer. You know, it's great that dude only ended up with [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5780.4800000000005s)]
*  30,000. But he broke it here because he busted down 30,000 and he bought a car. He gave, he gave [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5784.240000000001s)]
*  his boss 50 grand and he gave another security guard 20. Because it was, there were multiple [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5789.84s)]
*  people involved. The boss had to say, yeah, we'll do it. That's who said the 50K. And then, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5793.92s)]
*  then you have this other guy who was involved because he's seen the video. He knowing the [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5799.4400000000005s)]
*  conversation. He's knowing that they came to the hotel. So they're all involved at one point. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5803.84s)]
*  Some weak ass negotiators, bro. Yes. A video like that has worked for a few million. Are y'all crazy? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5807.84s)]
*  But Diddy said this would ruin my career. If you want to go, you might as well just go. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5813.2s)]
*  But they also, they recognize who Diddy was. So I'm sure that there's like a fan element to that, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5817.2s)]
*  right? But also at the time Eddie Garcia is making $10 and 50 cents per hour. And that's why, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5820.88s)]
*  that's why you shoot for the moon. You got a negotiator and you got to have a bird around [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5825.4400000000005s)]
*  you because a bird would have went to Google and be like, yo, this dude is worth such and such [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5828.4800000000005s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars, a hundred thousand. We shooting too low guys. And Diddy told him, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5831.68s)]
*  this is going to ruin my career if this ever comes out. What? You got eyes. You can watch [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5835.92s)]
*  that video yourself and know that could ruin Diddy's career. In 2016? Yeah. Because there's no [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5840.08s)]
*  difference between the trouble between if you get a hundred thousand and a million. Like that's the [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5845.36s)]
*  trouble. I think the first security guard, like I really think that there was a fan element to this [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5848.48s)]
*  because the first security guard that you're talking about, that we talked about a couple of [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5853.44s)]
*  weeks ago, he literally recorded the video because he's like, no one's going to believe that this is [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5856.48s)]
*  happening. Like you see Diddy in this video. It's like, Oh my God, have you seen Austin Powers? I [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5860.5599999999995s)]
*  need $1 million. Okay. A piece between all three of us. And then when Diddy would have been like, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5865.2s)]
*  that's a lot of money, more money, more problems. TMZ Harvey Levin. But what movie was Casey in? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5871.12s)]

*  to go to her movie premiere. So she's, she's saying, I don't want this come out because my [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5894.64s)]
*  movie's coming, blah, blah, blah. But the man is making $10 and 50 cents per hour. And then after [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxnDIXJdIJU&t=5898.64s)]
