*  He's 13. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=42.980000000000004s)]

*  Because she has a pool! [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=47.16s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=48.58s)]
*  All right, he just started going under, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=49.42s)]
*  he just started submerging his head and everything. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  But yeah, we fixing that nail envy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  Okay, I'm sorry. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=55.94s)]
*  But I'm nervous for my daughter [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=56.78s)]
*  because she's only nine months, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=58.34s)]
*  she's going on 10 months, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=60.08s)]
*  And y'all ever seen the videos [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  where the babies are being taught how to swim [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=62.260000000000005s)]
*  and they just throwing them in the pool? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=65.78s)]
*  That's just stupid. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=66.62s)]
*  I just don't feel like that's a good way [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=67.44s)]
*  to teach a baby how to swim. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=69.62s)]
*  Is that what they gonna do with you? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=71.02s)]
*  No, I hope they don't. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=71.98s)]
*  How do you teach a child how to swim [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=73.82s)]
*  before you potty train them? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=74.9s)]
*  That's what I, I'm just nervous about it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=76.14s)]
*  You gotta do it with the parent. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=78.26s)]
*  I never seen this before. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=79.18s)]
*  Like for our kids, you have to go actually [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=80.18s)]
*  in the pool with the kid or with your daughter or son [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=82.22s)]
*  and they just show them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=84.98s)]
*  So they get comfortable with the water [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=86.02s)]
*  so they're not afraid of the water. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=87.42s)]
*  And then they go step by step. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=88.66s)]
*  They start, you know, they'll learn to kick [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=89.98s)]
*  and they'll learn to float. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=92.34s)]
*  But it's just learning the water [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=93.18s)]
*  and understanding the water and not be afraid of the water. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=94.86s)]
*  And I don't believe in videos of real [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=96.7s)]
*  when people be throwing them little babies in the water. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=97.98s)]
*  They do. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=99.82s)]
*  You've seen that before? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=100.64s)]
*  They have to be real. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=101.48s)]
*  That's not AIO. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=102.32s)]
*  They be throwing them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=103.14s)]
*  They need to call child protective service. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=103.98s)]
*  That's how I feel every time I see it. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=105.3s)]
*  Every time I see it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  But the baby somehow like, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=108.42s)]
*  they be really swimming to the top [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=109.82s)]
*  and floating and back stroking and everything. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=111.38s)]
*  They say it's natural. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=113.22s)]
*  I wouldn't try that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=114.26s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=116.10000000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't try that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=116.94s)]
*  But they want swimming for nine months in water [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=117.76s)]
*  if you actually technically think about it. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=118.78s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like she should have been learned. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=120.74000000000001s)]
*  Like she, you know. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=123.7s)]
*  So who's getting in with the baby? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  You or Chris? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=125.9s)]
*  Chris. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  Chris is gonna get in with the baby. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=127.58s)]
*  I'm going with Ash. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=128.4s)]
*  But Ash is a different level. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=129.24s)]
*  Like Ash is not tadpole. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=130.28s)]
*  Well, Ash could stand up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=132.1s)]
*  So you gotta worry about it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=133.02s)]
*  Yeah, he just, he wanna learn how to swim comfortably. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=134.14000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=137.38s)]
*  Like he can survive a little bit. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=138.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=139.34s)]
*  Well, let me just give you one tip. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=140.18s)]
*  What? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=141.58s)]
*  Please make sure the water's heated. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=142.62s)]
*  Because some of those schools don't have heated water [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  and your kids will never wanna go back [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=146.46s)]
*  because it'd be too cold. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=148.10000000000002s)]
*  So when you take your kids to learn how to swim, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  make sure the pool is heated [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=151.62s)]
*  so that they're comfortable in there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=152.84s)]
*  Because most of the pools aren't heated. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=154.34s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  How the hell is she supposed to do that? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  She can't control the temperature of the pool. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=157.38000000000002s)]
*  No, you're calling Ash. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=158.9s)]
*  This is a swimming school. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=159.74s)]
*  You have a heated pool? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=160.58s)]
*  Yes, you asked. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  You asked. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  You have a heated pool because kids will, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=163.38000000000002s)]
*  that'd be the first thing that'd deter them [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  from getting back in the water. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, give her that tip. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=167.38000000000002s)]
*  Say, call first. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=168.22000000000003s)]
*  You just say, when you go there [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  make sure you have a heated pool. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  Well, you gotta make sure you call. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=171.64s)]
*  I don't give a damn who you are. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=172.48s)]
*  You're okay if you work for the breakfast tub. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=173.68s)]
*  You ain't. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=175.12s)]
*  We ain't gonna get no pools in here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=175.96s)]
*  We gotta make sure. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=176.8s)]

*  All right, y'all. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=264.16s)]
*  So first up on the front page, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=265.0s)]
*  President Trump is warning against protest [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=266.6s)]
*  on Saturday's military parade here in Washington, DC. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=268.82s)]
*  Now the president touted the upcoming military parade [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=272.94s)]
*  and issued a stern warning [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=275.42s)]
*  while speaking from the Oval Office yesterday afternoon. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=277.66s)]
*  Let's take a listen to that warning. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=280.38s)]
*  We're gonna have a fantastic June 14th parade, Flag Day. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=283.02s)]
*  It's gonna be an amazing day. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=287.66s)]
*  We have planes, we have all sorts of things. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=289.26000000000005s)]
*  And I think it's gonna be great. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=293.70000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna celebrate our country for a change. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  For those people that wanna protest, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=297.34000000000003s)]
*  they're gonna be met with very big force. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=299.22s)]
*  And I haven't even heard about a protest, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=301.02000000000004s)]
*  but you know, this is people that hate our country, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  but they will be met with very heavy force. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=307.14000000000004s)]
*  You can't tell people to celebrate their country [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  then suppress their first amendment. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=311.54s)]
*  Oh, I mean, that's just simple. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  All right, yeah, so the parade is set to happen [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=316.78s)]
*  as anti-ice protests have been happening [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=319.29999999999995s)]
*  in Los Angeles, California and other cities. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=321.5s)]
*  Now Saturday's parade is to so-called honor [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=323.58s)]
*  the Army's 250th birthday, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=326.7s)]
*  which is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of attendees. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=328.61999999999995s)]
*  Now various security measures have been put in place [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=332.14s)]
*  for the event, including an 18 and a half miles [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  of steel fencing, which I was downtown [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=337.41999999999996s)]
*  and I was able to see yesterday. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=339.9s)]
*  And 175 magnetometers, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=341.94s)]
*  which I believe detects certain devices. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=344.7s)]
*  They got magneto out there? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=347.74s)]
*  Boy, they Trump ain't playing. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=349.18s)]
*  But Trump was at North Carolina's Fort Bragg yesterday [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=351.62s)]
*  to help kick off that celebration. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=354.3s)]
*  He told hundreds of the troops gathered [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=356.74s)]
*  that Saturday's going to be a big day in Washington, DC. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=359.12s)]
*  Of course, it's also his birthday. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=362.3s)]
*  And to your point yesterday, Charlemagne, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=364.88s)]
*  this is expected to cost about $45 million. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  You said he's privately funding it though. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=371.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he said. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=373.3s)]
*  I don't know if it was true. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=375.74s)]
*  It's a TBD type of situation, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  but of course he did praise the troops. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=378.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm calling them the greatest fighting force. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=381.58s)]
*  Speaking of- [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=383.78s)]
*  I mean, the administration is making enough money [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=384.62s)]
*  that they can pay for it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=386.65999999999997s)]
*  Speaking of defense now, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=390.94s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hexeth, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=392.18s)]
*  he testified before members of the House yesterday [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=393.78s)]
*  and he will be back on the Hill today for more testimony. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=396.18s)]
*  He faced grilling from Democrats over the deployment [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  of the National Guard to Los Angeles [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=401.06s)]
*  as the city deals with, of course, the anti-ICE protests, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=403.41999999999996s)]
*  including from California Congressman Pete Aguilar, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=405.94s)]
*  who asked why they deployed the National Guard and Marines. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=408.65999999999997s)]
*  Hexeth, of course, defended President Trump's decision [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=412.41999999999996s)]
*  and they had quite a little bit of an exchange. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=414.94s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=417.05999999999995s)]
*  Every American citizen deserves to live [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=418.58s)]
*  in a community that's safe. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=421.5s)]
*  And ICE agents need to be able to do their job. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=423.58s)]
*  They're being attacked for doing their job, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  which is deporting illegal criminals. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=429.09999999999997s)]
*  He has every authority and he has done mobilizing [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=431.74s)]
*  National Guard or active duty troops under US code [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=435.02s)]
*  to protect federal agents in their job, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=438.54s)]
*  which is exactly what we're doing and we're proud to do it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  We're proud to do it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=444.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, proud to do it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=446.38s)]
*  So at one point he recalled the 2020 protests [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=447.86s)]
*  in Minneapolis while answering Minnesota Governor [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=450.62s)]
*  Congresswoman Betty McCollum. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=452.94s)]
*  Now Hexeth said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=454.62s)]
*  abandoned a police precinct and let it burn [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=456.7s)]
*  before mobilizing the National Guard when it was too late. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=458.98s)]
*  Of course, they're talking about on the heels [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=462.1s)]
*  of the George Floyd protests and Democrats [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=464.46s)]
*  on the subcommittee have also pressed Hexeth for details [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=466.66s)]
*  on where funding is coming from to send [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=469.58s)]
*  these National Guard troops to Los Angeles. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=471.66s)]
*  So I will keep you guys posted. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=474.22s)]
*  The conversation does continue at seven [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=475.82s)]
*  and we will get into more of what's happening [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=478.38s)]
*  with these anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=481.58s)]
*  So stick around. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=484.1s)]

*  800-585-1051. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=487.62s)]
*  If you need to vent, phone lines are wide open. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=489.78s)]
*  Again, 800-585-1051. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=492.41999999999996s)]

*  No, I was very fearful. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=613.0600000000001s)]
*  What Lovey's talking about, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=614.46s)]
*  when I had Madison, who was 23 years old, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=615.3000000000001s)]
*  she had a fever of like 105. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=618.94s)]
*  They didn't know what it was. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=621.82s)]
*  They didn't know if it was infection. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=622.82s)]
*  They did all types of tests and research. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=624.0600000000001s)]
*  You couldn't find anything. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=626.02s)]
*  I always talk about in the book, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=627.54s)]
*  there was this one black nurse [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=628.78s)]
*  that prayed over gear every day. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=629.9399999999999s)]
*  And then after two, three days, it just went away. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=632.06s)]
*  They never knew what it was. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=634.3s)]
*  They didn't know if it was an instrument. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=635.74s)]
*  They just didn't know. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=637.14s)]
*  They had no idea. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=638.74s)]
*  But everything happens, we give it up to God. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=639.62s)]
*  And it was one of those things. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=642.98s)]
*  And I'm an only child, so I'm one of the big family. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=644.62s)]
*  So six kids to me, it's a lot of fun to me. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=647.5799999999999s)]

*  that I started, and the name of my book is Life Is Just a Dream. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=743.26s)]
*  And where you from? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=746.14s)]
*  I'm from Brooklyn, born and raised. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=747.06s)]
*  Okay, all right. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=748.5s)]

*  Basically how I came from uniting my family [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=754.14s)]
*  during the pandemic when we was all locked in. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=756.86s)]
*  I grew up in a dysfunctional household. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=759.62s)]
*  My mother and my father never encouraged us to stay united, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=761.9s)]
*  so this is my way of uniting us all together. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=764.14s)]
*  And I can say it has worked, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=766.42s)]
*  and they see what I'm doing, and their family is united. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=767.9399999999999s)]

*  I'm good. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=806.5799999999999s)]
*  I just want to say that, you know, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=808.06s)]
*  I'm glad that Rock Barack a law, you know, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=810.38s)]
*  I did an interview with him on the I am bound news [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=813.5799999999999s)]
*  on Instagram and he has a nasty attitude. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=817.26s)]
*  You know, his attitude isn't right. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=820.5799999999999s)]
*  You know, I tried asking him a question. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=823.2199999999999s)]
*  I tried to film him. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=826.5s)]
*  He wouldn't let me. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=828.3399999999999s)]
*  He's supposed to represent the people [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=829.66s)]
*  and he didn't want to answer my question. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=831.78s)]
*  What was your question? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=834.06s)]
*  I was asking him what did he do for Newark [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=835.6999999999999s)]
*  and what did he do for the homeless? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=837.98s)]
*  He didn't want to answer my question. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=840.06s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you one thing, man, Barack, he swept Newark. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=842.14s)]
*  He won all five awards in Newark yesterday. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=844.74s)]
*  So, I mean, he didn't, of course he didn't win [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=847.9s)]
*  the New Jersey primary governor race book. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=849.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm glad he didn't win, because his attitude is nasty. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=852.22s)]
*  I got all right to video him. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=855.02s)]
*  Now Sean, did you have an actual interview with him [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=857.42s)]
*  or did you just pull up on him on the street? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=859.38s)]
*  I pulled up on him and asked him a question. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=861.3s)]
*  Well, see, that's your answer to your question. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=864.34s)]
*  You got to make a formal request [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=867.9s)]
*  for an interview with him. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=869.74s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=870.9399999999999s)]
*  He represent the people. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=871.86s)]
*  If you don't want to represent the people then... [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=873.54s)]
*  No, that's not true, brother. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=875.9399999999999s)]
*  You being selfish right now, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=877.62s)]
*  because you wouldn't want nobody to roll up on you with camera. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=879.7s)]
*  I got all right to ask him a question. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=881.82s)]
*  If you represent the people, you should want me to interview you. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=885.22s)]
*  Sure, but... [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=888.94s)]
*  If you don't want to represent the people then... [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=889.78s)]
*  You conflate in two things, my brother. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=892.94s)]
*  Now, if you wanted to ask him a question, that's one thing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=894.86s)]
*  An interview is another. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=897.26s)]
*  Now, you was a... [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=898.78s)]
*  That ain't an interview, baby. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=900.58s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=901.98s)]
*  You're asking him a question, that's not an interview. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=903.5s)]
*  That's two different things. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=904.9s)]
*  That's an interview, I'm doing it for you. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=906.0600000000001s)]
*  That's two different things, my brother. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=907.62s)]
*  Hey, you don't need to listen to nobody. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=909.02s)]
*  I can tell that he probably didn't even want to talk to you [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=911.66s)]
*  because of how you even coming at me. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=914.14s)]
*  I'm coming up with excuses for this guy. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=916.0600000000001s)]
*  This guy don't do nothing. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=917.82s)]
*  This ain't even about me, but... [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=919.98s)]
*  See? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=922.34s)]
*  This is not about Mayor Baraka. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=924.46s)]
*  My brother, this is not about Mayor Baraka. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=930.98s)]
*  This is just about proper etiquette. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=932.98s)]
*  If I walk up to somebody and I say, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=934.7s)]
*  hey, can I ask you a question? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=936.22s)]
*  That's one thing. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=937.82s)]
*  But if I say, hey, can I interview you? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=938.9s)]
*  That's another thing. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=940.62s)]
*  If you just walk up to me with a camera in my face [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=941.46s)]
*  trying to ask me a question, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=943.3s)]
*  I'm probably not going to answer your question. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=944.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=946.02s)]
*  But people say, oh, he's for the people. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=946.86s)]
*  Yes, he is for the people. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=948.66s)]
*  But like you said, there's proper etiquette. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=949.86s)]
*  If you want to interview somebody [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=951.26s)]
*  and ask them a series of questions, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=952.74s)]
*  there's proper protocol to do so. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=954.82s)]
*  But if I'm walking down the street and I have primaries [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=956.1800000000001s)]
*  and I'm doing whatever I'm doing, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=958.0600000000001s)]
*  I'm rushing, I'm this, that, and the ever, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=959.78s)]
*  I can answer your question. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=961.14s)]
*  But I can't stop for a 20 minute, a 10 minute, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=962.0600000000001s)]
*  a seven minute interview. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=964.7s)]
*  Forget a 10 minute. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=965.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm not stopping for a one minute, two minute interview. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=966.62s)]
*  I'm just talking about from being a public figure. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=968.38s)]
*  Don't walk up on me with no camera, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=970.46s)]
*  asking me no questions. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=972.4200000000001s)]
*  Now, if you say to me, hey, can I ask you a question? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=973.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=976.62s)]
*  But if you walk up to me with a camera [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=977.46s)]
*  and talk about, can I ask you a question? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=978.58s)]
*  I'm gonna be like, no, put the camera down. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=979.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm like, why? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=981.5s)]
*  Because I don't even know what you want. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=982.3399999999999s)]

*  from the BET Awards and then we are done, I promise. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1079.58s)]
*  Now, we're gonna, you guys wondering [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1082.1799999999998s)]
*  why Ciara didn't perform with Baa Baa? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1083.34s)]
*  We didn't even think about it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1085.3s)]
*  You didn't? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1086.4199999999998s)]
*  I didn't think about it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1087.26s)]
*  I wanna make sure, especially when he performed like you. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1088.1s)]
*  I mean, of course I would've wanted her to do her vocals. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1090.58s)]
*  Why not? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1092.58s)]
*  But then she came out like five minutes later, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1093.4199999999998s)]
*  so I did think about it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1094.7s)]
*  Yes, I think a lot of us there, even in real time, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1095.6599999999999s)]
*  were like, oh, she's not gonna take the stage. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1098.54s)]
*  We thought it was gonna be like a good surprise. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1100.62s)]
*  Didn't even. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1102.82s)]
*  I didn't, didn't. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1103.6599999999999s)]
*  And it spilled over online as well, too. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1104.9799999999998s)]
*  Twitter was going a bit crazy wondering why. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1107.62s)]
*  And some people was just saying like, yo, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1109.58s)]
*  I love that she's choosing her piece [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1111.2199999999998s)]
*  and she ain't getting on stage. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1112.62s)]
*  But TMZ called Baa Baa out and asked him [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1113.9799999999998s)]
*  why Ciara didn't take the stage. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1116.78s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1118.02s)]
*  Everybody was wondering why Ciara [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1119.1399999999999s)]
*  ain't come out for like you. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1120.86s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie to you, it's a real s***. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1122.6999999999998s)]
*  I was gonna put this on myself. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1124.26s)]
*  When we do the worst on BET, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1125.74s)]
*  it's the one that outs her all the time. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1128.38s)]
*  So I don't know if she was aware or not, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1129.98s)]
*  but I didn't even know she was in the building. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1131.74s)]
*  I've been in my trailer all day. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1133.14s)]
*  I've been at rehearsals, I had to host a red carpet. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1134.26s)]
*  But I will say this, it would've been a wonderful moment. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1136.3s)]
*  If she didn't come out, I know she was in attendance. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1138.38s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1140.26s)]
*  I didn't know until I got off the stage [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1141.1000000000001s)]
*  and went back to my trailer and checked Twitter. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1142.3s)]
*  But I will say this, Scream Fest is coming up. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1144.58s)]
*  F*** them all. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1147.1000000000001s)]
*  And the next one, me and B2K. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1147.94s)]
*  Stay. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1151.02s)]
*  I would've rather seen Ciara perform by herself. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1151.8600000000001s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, I could be wrong, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1155.0600000000002s)]
*  but I remember back in the day, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1156.9s)]
*  didn't Ciara debut on 106 and Park? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1158.5s)]
*  Like the first time we ever saw her perform live. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1160.3400000000001s)]
*  Something like a goodies. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1162.5400000000002s)]
*  I don't know why Vegas remembered that as well. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1164.0600000000002s)]
*  With Jazzy Fay. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1166.42s)]
*  With Jazzy Fay. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1167.26s)]
*  Oh, the ones who stabbed. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1168.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I feel like I remember something like that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1169.5s)]
*  But Like You was probably one of the biggest records [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1173.6200000000001s)]
*  on 106 and Park at the time. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1175.74s)]
*  All that stuff with goodies, all that stuff? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1176.5800000000002s)]
*  I felt like goodies was performed. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1178.18s)]
*  Yeah, but that would've been dope to see it all. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1179.94s)]
*  So according to Wikipedia, yes. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1182.22s)]
*  So it was the video, Sorry was premiered on BT's 106 and Park [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1185.14s)]
*  as well as Vivo. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1188.3400000000001s)]
*  That was with the release of her debut single, Goodies. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1189.5800000000002s)]
*  So it was all at the same time. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1191.98s)]
*  This is according to Wikipedia. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1193.0600000000002s)]
*  But to your point, yes. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1194.6200000000001s)]
*  And when Ciara was there in the media room, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1196.02s)]
*  we were talking to her [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1198.1000000000001s)]
*  and a bunch of other outlets were talking to her. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1199.3400000000001s)]
*  She was celebrating, I think it's like 21 years, she said, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1200.9s)]
*  of goodies and it just being a huge shot for her. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1204.02s)]
*  So I think that's why a lot of us were like, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1206.74s)]
*  no Ciara, like no word at all. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1209.1000000000001s)]
*  She came out literally five minutes after. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1210.3s)]
*  Performance wise though, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1212.14s)]
*  because she did hit the stage. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1212.98s)]
*  I must be the only person that does not, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1214.3s)]
*  when I, Bow Wow and Ciara are not synonymous [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1216.26s)]
*  with each other to me. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1218.74s)]
*  For that song, I've got to go. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1219.58s)]
*  I wasn't tripping off her not doing like you, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1220.66s)]
*  even though it would've been like, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1222.3s)]
*  it's nostalgic to see. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1224.02s)]
*  I just thought on stage in general. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1225.18s)]
*  But also in the BT Awards conversation, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1227.58s)]
*  Clarissa Shields. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1229.74s)]
*  So people got a bit upset about some of the tweets [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1230.58s)]
*  that she shot out after she did not win [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1233.42s)]
*  Sportswoman of the Year. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1235.46s)]
*  She tweeted, I still don't know how I didn't win [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1237.46s)]
*  Sportswoman of the Year for the BT Awards, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1239.46s)]
*  but congrats to Angel Reese and all of the other nominees. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1241.5s)]
*  I just thought accolades mattered. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1244.3400000000001s)]
*  Then she tweeted again, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1246.74s)]
*  let me go on ahead and make up for missing two days [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1247.78s)]
*  of grinding at the gym to attend all this BT stuff. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1250.42s)]
*  I defend my undisputed heavyweight title on July 26. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1253.3000000000002s)]
*  If and when I win that fight, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1256.5s)]
*  I'll be in the 19 time world champ. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1259.5800000000002s)]
*  Then she had to come back because people started responding [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1262.26s)]
*  and basically saying to her like, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1264.46s)]
*  why are you downplaying Angel Reese's win [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1266.18s)]
*  just because you didn't? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1267.94s)]
*  And she says, nobody's saying that Angel Reese [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1270.1399999999999s)]
*  doesn't have accolades or that she's not good. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1271.98s)]
*  I'm just saying that I thought the person with the most, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1273.82s)]
*  she capitalized most accolades and accomplishments [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1275.86s)]
*  to win the award. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1278.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm team Angel Reese. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1279.46s)]
*  I'm not joining the hate train when it comes to Angel Reese. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1280.58s)]
*  I have mad respect for her. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1282.78s)]
*  And all the other female athletes that excel in the sport [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1284.26s)]
*  asked for my earlier comments. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1287.02s)]
*  I am allowed to express my feelings. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1288.46s)]
*  I was just shocked I didn't win. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1289.78s)]
*  Why, she's talking about like career accolades? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1291.46s)]
*  I'm confused. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1292.78s)]
*  Like what's going on? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1293.6s)]
*  Accolades are normally career accolades. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1295.1s)]
*  What else are accolades? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1296.98s)]
*  Angel Reese, that's the case. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1298.02s)]
*  You got what Simone Biles was in that category. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1299.8600000000001s)]
*  Don Stanley, Asian Wilson. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1303.18s)]
*  It's mad people with career accolades. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1306.02s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1307.8200000000002s)]
*  Isn't that athlete of the year? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1308.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's about what you did in the last 365 days. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1310.06s)]
*  First woman of the year. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1312.26s)]
*  And she would have to understand why people [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1313.5800000000002s)]
*  would think she was hating, right? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1314.9s)]
*  The fact that Angel Reese won and you took my accolades. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1316.06s)]
*  Like that's the first thing people would say. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1318.98s)]
*  Yeah, but she does say in that very first tweet though, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1320.5800000000002s)]
*  like I'm team Angel Reese. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1322.54s)]
*  I think she just speaking up for herself. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1323.94s)]
*  But that's why people thought that. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1325.54s)]
*  Clarissa has had a great year though. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1328.02s)]
*  She has, absolutely. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1329.34s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1330.1799999999998s)]
*  And to be clear with the nominees for the BET award, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1331.02s)]
*  they're determined in each category [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1333.34s)]
*  and the voting process happens by Academy members. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1335.1s)]
*  So, I mean, I don't know exactly what they looking at. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1338.6599999999999s)]
*  Let's get focused, champ. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1341.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1341.94s)]
*  Let's get focused, champ. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1342.78s)]
*  And that's all that is. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1343.62s)]
*  It's just, yeah, now it's time to get focused back. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1344.46s)]
*  Like she said, it's time to get focused back [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1345.7s)]
*  on what she should actually be focused on. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1347.1799999999998s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1349.82s)]
*  That's right, because she need to win on, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1350.6599999999999s)]
*  she will win on July 26th, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1351.8999999999999s)]
*  but you just gotta stay focused [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1353.4199999999998s)]
*  because anything can happen in that ring. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1354.86s)]
*  And the last thing Clarissa Shield right now, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1356.42s)]
*  needs right now is a loss. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1358.6200000000001s)]
*  Cause the internet will have a field day. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1360.3000000000002s)]
*  Because she's been having a good time, don't other stuff? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1361.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1364.3400000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly what it is. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1365.38s)]

*  I think she'll be focused. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1370.0200000000002s)]
*  I guess honestly the first time [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1370.8600000000001s)]
*  I heard her talk about her upcoming fight in a while. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1371.7s)]
*  Oh no, she promotes that fight. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1375.98s)]

*  Oh yeah. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1378.74s)]
*  Every time Clarissa pulls something, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1379.5800000000002s)]
*  she promote that fight. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1381.5800000000002s)]
*  Okay, cause I thought it was smart [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1382.42s)]
*  that she put it in the suite. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1383.5s)]
*  Cause I thought the same way, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1384.3400000000001s)]
*  but maybe I just don't pay enough attention to that. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1385.5s)]
*  Now if you follow us, she always talk about the fight. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1387.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1389.1000000000001s)]

*  Well, I'm wishing her a safe fight and a win. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1390.78s)]
*  Because as y'all said, I think she needed W too. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1393.46s)]
*  Cause the trolls love to get her. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1395.46s)]

*  Now President Donald Trump, he's warning other cities [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1434.7s)]
*  that anti-ice protests will be met with equal [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1436.78s)]
*  or greater force than Los Angeles. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1439.6200000000001s)]

*  he could invoke the Insurrection Act in California. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1449.5s)]

*  at North Carolina's Fort Bragg on Tuesday. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1461.5s)]

*  that the once beautiful city has turned into a trash heap. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1466.6200000000001s)]

*  But they proudly carry the flags of other countries, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1487.9399999999998s)]
*  but they don't carry the American flag. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1492.4599999999998s)]
*  They only burn it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1494.7399999999998s)]
*  Did you see a lot of the flags being burned? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1495.58s)]
*  He went on to call the protest and protesters, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1498.02s)]
*  invaders, violent and insurrectionists. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1500.94s)]
*  And he thanked the National Guard and Marines [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1503.18s)]
*  who are being deployed to the city. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1505.26s)]
*  He also made some really horrible comments. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1506.54s)]
*  Well, in my opinion, they're horrible saying, you know, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1509.3s)]
*  saying that LA is on fire right now, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1512.18s)]
*  but you know, this comes on the heels [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1514.38s)]
*  of essentially of the LA fires. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1515.98s)]
*  Basically saying that LA is being burned to the ground [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1517.78s)]
*  and that it's on fire. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1521.02s)]
*  A lot of things are on fire essentially [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1522.3400000000001s)]
*  the same way that it was earlier this year [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1525.06s)]
*  in reference to the wildfires. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1527.38s)]
*  I think he should be more specific. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1530.18s)]
*  Like, you know, you can't just say, you know, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1531.5400000000002s)]
*  you're against protesting because, you know, protesting, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1533.3000000000002s)]
*  you have the right to protest, you know, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1535.8600000000001s)]
*  be it a constitution, your first amendment. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1537.5400000000002s)]
*  You know, you have to write the piece of protest. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1539.5s)]
*  Like if he's talking about, you know, violence [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1540.98s)]
*  and, you know, insurrectionists, you know, I understand. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1543.18s)]
*  But then I would also have the question, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1545.8200000000002s)]
*  we had an insurrection on January 6th. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1547.6200000000001s)]
*  Why wasn't the National Guard deployed then? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1549.5800000000002s)]
*  National Guard definitely should have been called [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1552.46s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1553.94s)]
*  Yeah, people got actually killed. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1554.7800000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1555.6200000000001s)]
*  And cops got assaulted. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1556.46s)]
*  Why wasn't the National Guard deployed on January 6th? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1558.3s)]
*  There's nothing I've seen in LA [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1560.34s)]
*  that looks remotely like January 6th. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1561.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, that's essentially, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1563.42s)]
*  well, let's jump to California Gavin Newsom. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1564.82s)]
*  That's essentially what he had to say. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1566.62s)]
*  He criticized President Trump's response [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1567.86s)]
*  to those protests in LA. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1569.62s)]
*  Last night, Newsom gave a speech saying [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1571.1399999999999s)]
*  Trump escalated the situation [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1573.62s)]
*  by sending the National Guard troops and US Marines [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1574.98s)]
*  to deal with the protesters, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1577.46s)]
*  adding that he overstepped his authority [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1579.02s)]
*  by commandeering the National Guard. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1580.62s)]
*  Now, Newsom said this is only beginning, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1582.62s)]
*  only the beginning, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1585.1399999999999s)]
*  and that California is essentially the first state. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1586.06s)]
*  So beware. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1587.98s)]
*  He issued a warning essentially to the rest of the country. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1589.34s)]
*  And he also criticized President Trump [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1592.8999999999999s)]
*  for selective law and order. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1594.7s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1596.5s)]
*  California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1597.5s)]
*  Other states are next. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1600.78s)]
*  Democracy is next. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1602.46s)]
*  Democracy is under assault before our eyes. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1604.7s)]
*  This moment we have feared has arrived. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1608.02s)]
*  And by the way, Trump, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1611.62s)]
*  he's not opposed to lawlessness and violence [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1613.46s)]
*  as long as it serves him. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1616.3000000000002s)]
*  What more evidence do we need than January 6th? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1618.9s)]
*  To your point, Charlamagne. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1621.98s)]
*  I don't wanna make the same point as Gavin Newsom, though. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1623.94s)]
*  There's something about Gavin Newsom [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1626.7s)]
*  that just don't sit right with me. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1629.02s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1629.8600000000001s)]
*  I can't put my finger on it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1630.7s)]
*  But I was watching CNN last night, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1631.52s)]
*  and I'm watching the LAPD say they can handle the protest. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1634.42s)]
*  They say there's been 50 arrests [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1639.14s)]
*  and 600 non-lethal rounds fired. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1640.78s)]
*  It was like, yo, we got this. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1642.94s)]
*  So why is the National Guard there? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1644.5s)]
*  I do have a question. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1647.3000000000002s)]
*  Did Representative Maxine Waters say [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1648.14s)]
*  there was no violence there, or was that fake? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1650.1000000000001s)]
*  Because I seen that clip going out, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1651.7800000000002s)]
*  but I wasn't sure if that was real. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1653.3000000000002s)]
*  No, I have not seen that clip. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1655.02s)]
*  I have seen that she has been shut out of facilities [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1656.8200000000002s)]
*  that she's been trying to access. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1660.42s)]
*  I have not seen a clip where she has indicated [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1662.0600000000002s)]
*  whether or not the protests have been violent or not. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1664.6200000000001s)]
*  But I have seen her being, in a sense, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1667.72s)]
*  mistreated for what is considered a 80 plus year old woman, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1671.02s)]
*  trying to access certain facilities. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1675.38s)]
*  And that- [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1677.38s)]
*  There have been violent demonstrations. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1678.22s)]
*  I mean, the LAPD said that despite violent demonstrations, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1680.18s)]
*  local police can handle whatever protesters throw at them, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1685.66s)]
*  and that additional federal help is unnecessary [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1689.22s)]
*  and could become a hindrance. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1692.6200000000001s)]
*  The LAPD said that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1693.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1695.58s)]
*  So yeah, to your point, LAPD Chief Jim McDonald says, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1696.42s)]
*  anyone not found to be exempt within the designated- [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1700.02s)]
*  Oh, excuse me. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1702.42s)]
*  Well, they issued a curfew for some of that yesterday. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1703.26s)]
*  Let's get into Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1705.78s)]
*  comments regarding that curfew, if we can. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1708.86s)]
*  She's saying a lot of businesses [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1710.72s)]
*  and businesses have been affected by graffiti and looting, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1712.34s)]
*  and those who are responsible will be held accountable. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1715.54s)]
*  But to your point, it seems as though, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1718.62s)]
*  or they are indicating the local authorities in California [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1720.74s)]
*  and LA indicating that they pretty much have a handle on it. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1724.9s)]
*  Let's take a listen to LA Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1727.48s)]
*  Many businesses have now been affected by or vandalized. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1730.6999999999998s)]
*  Last night, there were 23 businesses that were looted, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1734.58s)]
*  and I think that if you drive through downtown LA, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1738.2199999999998s)]
*  the graffiti is everywhere. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1742.4599999999998s)]
*  If you do not live or work in downtown LA, avoid the area. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1744.9799999999998s)]
*  Law enforcement will arrest individuals [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1750.06s)]
*  who break the curfew, and you will be prosecuted. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1752.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've been seeing a lot of videos [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1755.74s)]
*  and a lot of locals talk about it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1756.9799999999998s)]
*  A lot of people have said that they live in LA, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1758.26s)]
*  and they said that the military actually made it worse. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1760.7s)]
*  And they're saying that a lot of the news is sensationalized, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1763.34s)]
*  a lot of the stuff that they're actually seeing. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1765.7s)]
*  They're saying they're making it seem like it's the watch [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1767.62s)]
*  riot, but it's not even close. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1769.3799999999999s)]
*  That's what we've been saying all week. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1771.1399999999999s)]
*  So what's the point of having 4,000 national guardsmen there [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1772.58s)]
*  and 700 Marines? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1775.5s)]
*  What's the point? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1777.42s)]
*  Of course, this does come after, to your point, you guys, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1779.8999999999999s)]
*  this all comes as demonstrators. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1783.66s)]
*  We're seeing throwing objects at dozens of officers [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1784.98s)]
*  guarding the federal buildings. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1787.92s)]
*  And of course, police responded with flash bangs, tear gas, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1790.5400000000002s)]
*  and non-lethal rounds, those rubber bullets [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1793.3400000000001s)]
*  that we saw in black and white. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1795.8200000000002s)]
*  And they arrested some people for attempted murder [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1798.26s)]
*  because they were throwing Molotov cocktails. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1800.3000000000002s)]
*  And there was assault with a deadly weapon [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1802.7s)]
*  on a police officer. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1804.18s)]
*  But overall, they said they made, I think, 50 arrests, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1805.02s)]
*  50 or 51 arrests or something like that. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1807.9s)]
*  And they fired 600 non-lethal bullets. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1809.5400000000002s)]
*  More of the story is LAPD said they got it. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1811.26s)]
*  So there's no need for the National Guard [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1813.9s)]
*  to be there right now. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1815.66s)]
*  And if I can just switch gears for something ICE-relative. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1817.78s)]
*  New Jersey US Representative LaMonica McIver [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1821.66s)]
*  is facing federal charges now in connection [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1824.74s)]
*  with an altercation at an ICE detention center [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1826.86s)]
*  in Newark, New Jersey last month. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1829.58s)]
*  Now on Tuesday, a grand jury indicted [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1831.18s)]
*  the New Jersey Democrat for forcibly impeding [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1833.02s)]
*  and interfering with federal law enforcement officers. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1835.3799999999999s)]
*  The three count indictment comes weeks [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1838.34s)]
*  after the Justice Department filed charges [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1840.06s)]
*  against McIver over the same incident. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1842.02s)]
*  So again, this is something that even though LA [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1844.62s)]
*  is dealing with protests, you have your elected officials [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1847.82s)]
*  in Newark being impacted. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1851.3799999999999s)]
*  And then there are protests around the country. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1853.06s)]
*  And it's all in the name of immigration and anti-ICE. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1855.26s)]
*  So you guys just be safe out there. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1858.3s)]
*  But that pretty much wraps up your front page news for today. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1860.62s)]

*  Yeah, you know, I used to DJ back in the day [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1922.74s)]
*  when I was young in the hood. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1924.3s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1926.18s)]
*  I hustled up on the DJ set [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1927.02s)]

*  just DJ on people's porches. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1930.74s)]
*  That was kind of my thing, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1932.98s)]
*  but that's how I got into music. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1933.82s)]
*  So for me, it's just like a pastime. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1935.78s)]
*  But you know, like the great Andre 3000 said, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1938.46s)]
*  if you can't find the vibe, you gotta create it. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=1941.0600000000002s)]

*  But the consequences are not dire. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2044.78s)]
*  They're just real life things [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2047.1s)]
*  and you gotta show your adversity. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2048.42s)]
*  I was just talking to somebody about this other day. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2051.7000000000003s)]
*  It's just like, now Soul Survivor really resonates with me. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2053.54s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2056.54s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2057.38s)]
*  Because I'm a Soul Survivor and I'm listening to the words. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2058.42s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this is me, this is who I am. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2060.3s)]
*  When I wrote it, it was a record. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2062.7000000000003s)]
*  Now this is my life. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2064.54s)]
*  And it's just like to be 20, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2065.94s)]
*  because you gotta think, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2067.2200000000003s)]
*  you think about Pac and Big. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2068.06s)]
*  What would they have done 20 years in the game? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2070.86s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2074.06s)]
*  You celebrating all eyes on me. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2075.02s)]
*  Life after death 20 years later. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2078.26s)]
*  I don't know, Pac might have been DJing in his basement. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2081.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2082.8199999999997s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2083.66s)]
*  I'm living life and I'm going through [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2084.98s)]
*  one of those stages where you get to watch the game [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2089.46s)]
*  while I watch the streets. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2092.9s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2094.66s)]
*  I'm in this world, but I'm not of it. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2095.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2096.8599999999997s)]
*  So I get to watch it, but at the same time, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2097.7s)]
*  I already put my work in, so I get to sit back. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2099.94s)]
*  But I'm dealing with real stuff now, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2102.5s)]
*  running companies and doing deals [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2104.54s)]
*  and empowering other people. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2106.46s)]
*  So it's now I gotta really practice my skills of leadership, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2109.06s)]
*  but with my catalog behind me, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2114.02s)]
*  because I can stand on that because it's solid. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2116.46s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2118.42s)]
*  So I'm not, you know, I'm Franky, Beverly and Mays. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2119.2599999999998s)]
*  I can keep going if I wanted to, but I haven't got to. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2121.22s)]
*  Do you have survivors remorse at all? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2123.38s)]
*  Because I used to. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2124.7799999999997s)]
*  You have so many people that you ran into, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2126.02s)]
*  partners and people that you met. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2127.86s)]
*  Yeah, I used to, but everybody know me. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2129.02s)]
*  They know I'm solid. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2131.1s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2131.94s)]
*  But at the same time, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2132.7799999999997s)]
*  my life is about peace, joy and freedom. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2133.86s)]
*  And I ain't even, I'm saying that to say, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2136.2599999999998s)]
*  a lot of people don't survive the war, baby. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2137.78s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2139.6200000000003s)]
*  It's like, I ain't got no reason to go back. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2140.46s)]
*  Ain't nothing to prove. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2142.86s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2143.82s)]
*  I'm just trying to live my life, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2144.6600000000003s)]
*  make sure my people straight, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2146.1000000000004s)]
*  put as many people as I could put on [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2147.7000000000003s)]
*  and keep just inspiring and involving my culture, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2149.9s)]
*  which is why I'm even doing this symphony tour, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2154.1800000000003s)]
*  which is crazy because I think I'm the first one [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2157.46s)]
*  to ever take a symphony around the world to do a tour. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2159.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2163.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm the first one to celebrate my first debut album, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2164.46s)]
*  which is about three, four times platinum. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2168.18s)]
*  I ain't checked last time. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2169.86s)]
*  Oh, I can't wait. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2171.06s)]
*  I'm talking to the mic. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2171.9s)]
*  I'm going to try to put some motivation. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2174.02s)]
*  One on one? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2176.9s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2177.7400000000002s)]
*  And it's crazy because it's like, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2178.58s)]
*  the only time I remember putting on a suit [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2180.66s)]
*  is for a funeral or a wedding. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2182.18s)]
*  This is a celebration. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2185.3s)]
*  And it's not just about the music. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2186.18s)]
*  It's about everybody who came along [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2190.18s)]
*  on this journey with me that are celebrating. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2191.66s)]
*  Think about where you were 20 years ago. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2193.66s)]
*  Where you were 20 years ago and where y'all at now. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2196.5s)]
*  This is a celebration of that because that music reminds you [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2198.2599999999998s)]
*  at that time you was out there grinding, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2201.18s)]
*  but look what you grinded too. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2202.7s)]
*  So this is a reason for everybody to put on a suit [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2204.18s)]
*  and a nice black dress and come out and celebrate. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2206.18s)]
*  And I do want to say this. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2208.62s)]
*  This is not the opera. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2210.22s)]
*  You're not going to sit down and cross your legs. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2213.06s)]
*  This is a party. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2216.02s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2217.14s)]
*  At the same time, shout out to Adam Blackstone. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2217.98s)]
*  He helped me produce it. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2221.46s)]
*  Dee Hodges, he wrote the music. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2222.94s)]
*  He's actually conducting it. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2225.3s)]
*  Those brothers are crazy. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2226.34s)]
*  I brought DJ Drama with me. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2227.38s)]
*  So you know it's a party. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2229.02s)]
*  I got DJ Ace with me. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2229.86s)]
*  It's a celebration. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2231.3s)]
*  When you were making this album 20 years ago, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2232.98s)]
*  were you just making songs or were you thinking the future? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2236.3s)]
*  Were you thinking catalog? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2239.54s)]
*  Because you look at a lot of people in the industry [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2240.5s)]
*  and their catalog is not strong. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2242.62s)]
*  Their first album, the catalog is not strong. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2244.18s)]
*  They can't go on tour. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2245.82s)]
*  Were you thinking about that when you were writing [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2247.22s)]
*  this first album? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2248.46s)]
*  I'm just trying to get out the hood. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2249.5800000000004s)]
*  I was just trying to stay alive and free. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2251.3s)]
*  And I just wanted to be heard. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2253.82s)]
*  And the reason why that album is so solid [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2255.42s)]
*  is because I put everything in there. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2258.42s)]
*  I didn't have another shot. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2260.82s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2262.2200000000003s)]
*  It wasn't like no labor was looking for me. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2263.0600000000004s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2265.86s)]
*  I had spent all this money to build this buzz [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2266.7000000000003s)]
*  and I had this one opportunity. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2271.34s)]
*  And you got to think, I lost my voice. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2272.78s)]
*  I tore my vocal cords. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2275.46s)]
*  You know, I had bells, like all these things [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2277.38s)]
*  happened at one time. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2279.46s)]
*  And I'm just like, I was humbled. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2280.7s)]
*  And the album got leaked four weeks before it came out. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2282.62s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2285.9s)]
*  I was up against all that and I'm still like praying. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2286.7400000000002s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2290.38s)]
*  And it happened. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2291.22s)]
*  So when I look back 20 years ago, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2292.34s)]
*  like I didn't realize what I was doing, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2295.1s)]
*  but I knew to change the trajectory of my family [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2298.54s)]
*  and our generation of wealth and getting my family [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2301.42s)]
*  in a better place that this is all I had. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2304.7s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2307.3799999999997s)]
*  So I put everything in the album. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2308.22s)]
*  Trapper died in this. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2309.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, everything. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2311.06s)]
*  By the way, I probably was riding around [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2312.14s)]

*  Interesting what you said about the record, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2323.22s)]
*  Soul Survivor, because at that point in your life, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2324.46s)]
*  you had survived to a certain extent, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2327.14s)]
*  but you didn't feel that way. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2329.1s)]

*  I didn't really even start celebrating life [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2332.3799999999997s)]
*  until the recession. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2334.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2335.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was out of it, bro. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2336.5s)]
*  I was drinking, smoking, living. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2337.86s)]

*  damn, I'm still free. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2344.0600000000004s)]
*  You know? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2345.82s)]
*  So you thought at any moment it could go down. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2346.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2348.34s)]

*  Because it's every day, it never stops. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2352.8s)]
*  You're always on edge. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2355.02s)]
*  You're living from a survivor mindset. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2356.1400000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2360.0600000000004s)]

*  when I started to work on the recession, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2363.74s)]
*  that's when I realized what abundance was. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2366.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2368.9399999999996s)]

*  You're like, man, they're throwing odd objects at me. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2396.22s)]
*  You know, bras and stuff. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2401.22s)]
*  But I'm like, yo, this is different. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2402.06s)]
*  Because you got to think, when I was doing shows, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2403.9s)]
*  when Thug Motivation came out, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2405.54s)]
*  all the gangsters in the front, you know what I'm saying? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2407.26s)]
*  All the hustlers, it wasn't no women. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2409.42s)]
*  I didn't have any women fans. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2411.82s)]
*  Shout out to the women fans out there. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2413.26s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2414.7400000000002s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Jeezy, Charlamagne. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2415.58s)]
*  Emotionally, do you ever get triggered [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2417.66s)]
*  when you're on stage performing some of those records though? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2419.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2421.54s)]
*  I mean, especially like lately, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2422.38s)]
*  because I'm so seasoned with it, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2424.14s)]
*  that everything is like a sermon to me. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2426.46s)]
*  Some of those songs, especially like 20 years later, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2429.5s)]
*  to see it, because I'm going to be honest, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2432.3s)]
*  Soul Survivor hits so different. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2433.9s)]
*  Shout out to Secure Stewart, rest in peace. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2436.38s)]
*  He made me put that on the album. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2438.46s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2440.34s)]
*  But my whole thing was like, I want to go trap or die. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2441.18s)]
*  And imagine if I would have listened to that myself [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2444.58s)]
*  and stayed on that trajectory. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2446.9s)]
*  And then where is that now? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2448.7s)]
*  Because when I'm doing this Soul Survivor in the arenas, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2449.86s)]
*  and I'm looking at these kids, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2452.98s)]
*  or I'm looking at these people, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2454.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm like, I want to do they realize, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2455.78s)]
*  like this is who I am. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2457.94s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2459.1400000000003s)]
*  And this is me living my dream, being on the stage. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2459.98s)]
*  And I'm still getting standing ovations 20 years later. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2462.1000000000004s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2464.86s)]
*  So I don't know nobody else that can say [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2465.7000000000003s)]
*  that there's Soul Survivor and mean it like that. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2469.02s)]
*  So yeah, that record means a lot to me. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2471.1400000000003s)]
*  And even trap or die, you know what I'm saying? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2473.1400000000003s)]
*  It's just like, that's real. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2474.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2476.5800000000004s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2477.42s)]
*  But you're not sitting on the block [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2478.26s)]
*  with your thang cock no more. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2479.1000000000004s)]
*  No, but we'll talk about that offline. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2480.6600000000003s)]
*  But I was gonna ask, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2483.7400000000002s)]
*  does the street mentality actually leave, right? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2486.5800000000004s)]
*  So if you see, I mean, and you've been around Jay, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2488.7000000000003s)]
*  and you've seen his evolution of being always looking [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2491.0600000000004s)]
*  over his shoulder to now, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2494.42s)]
*  when I see him walking in the building, it's like free. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2495.98s)]
*  I don't have to worry about that. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2497.86s)]
*  Even when I see 50 more, he feels more free. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2499.2200000000003s)]
*  Do you feel that way? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2501.7400000000002s)]
*  Or do you feel like I'm always still got it? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2502.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, but I still got it because I'm not exempt. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2504.82s)]
*  But I understand what it is. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2509.1s)]
*  But I carry myself with a level of integrity. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2509.94s)]
*  So it's just like, as long as I feel like it's mutual respect, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2513.22s)]
*  I don't feel like the need to even have to wash the room. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2517.3799999999997s)]
*  But I will tell you this. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2520.3399999999997s)]
*  I've been on a journey for about like [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2522.62s)]
*  almost eight, nine years now. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2525.5s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2527.3399999999997s)]
*  But I can tell you at this point in my life, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2528.18s)]
*  like I'm really at peace. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2529.3799999999997s)]
*  Like I don't worry about the things that I can't control. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2530.98s)]
*  And that is including people. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2534.1s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2536.06s)]
*  For me, it's just like, everybody know me. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2536.9s)]
*  I float around my city, or any city. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2539.2200000000003s)]
*  What got you there though? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2540.82s)]
*  Cause it took you a long time to get there. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2541.7400000000002s)]
*  What got you there? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2543.06s)]
*  Work. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2543.9s)]
*  Therapy. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2544.7400000000002s)]
*  Therapy, work, journaling, meditating, all that. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2545.58s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2548.5s)]
*  Like I'm not even gonna hold you. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2549.34s)]
*  Like it's real. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2550.3s)]
*  And when you wake up and you start to realize like, okay, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2551.7400000000002s)]
*  and you can emotionally regulate and you know who you are, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2555.02s)]
*  you have nothing to prove, there's no better feeling. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2558.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2560.98s)]
*  Because I don't got to prove anything. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2561.82s)]
*  And by the way, you can see, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2562.9s)]

*  and was on the patchworks and I played the whole album. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2666.2200000000003s)]
*  And when I got to that song, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2668.94s)]
*  it was all clapping when it was done. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2670.02s)]
*  And I'm like, yo, by the way, I'm putting Jay-Z on the song. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2671.46s)]

*  All right. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2681.98s)]

*  Thug Motivation 101, is there a record [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2768.02s)]
*  that didn't make the album because of Clarence [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2770.3s)]
*  or for whatever reason that you said, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2772.1s)]
*  damn, I wish that one made the album? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2773.3s)]
*  Yeah, it was a bunch of like mixtape stuff [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2775.34s)]
*  that didn't make it. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2778.42s)]
*  And the thing about it is like the album [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2779.74s)]
*  really got pressured out, you know what I'm saying? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2781.5s)]
*  Because one of the interns who was up there [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2783.3s)]
*  who was trying to get his beats on the album [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2785.94s)]
*  will get eight beat on the album. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2789.06s)]
*  You know, I never did anything on his records [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2790.62s)]
*  and I left my drives at Patchworks. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2792.94s)]
*  So I guess he got mad and leaked the album [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2796.62s)]
*  four weeks before it came out. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2801.06s)]
*  So now, bells, pauses, vocal chords, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2802.74s)]
*  all these things happening at once [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2807.8199999999997s)]
*  and now the album's leaked. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2809.42s)]
*  So now I'm sitting there and I'm like, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2811.38s)]
*  what am I gonna do? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2814.9s)]
*  Because now I gotta think of the next plan. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2815.8199999999997s)]
*  So I can't go back to the streets, you know what I'm saying? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2817.54s)]
*  Because now I'm like, damn, like this is it. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=2819.8199999999997s)]

*  Especially when you're talking art, you're talking culture, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3058.6s)]
*  you're talking your mind. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3060.84s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3061.8s)]
*  Like I've worked hard my whole life. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3062.64s)]
*  This is like, this is the season of me. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3063.96s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3066.48s)]
*  I'm putting myself first at all costs. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3067.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3069.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's just like, my peace is everything. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3070.56s)]
*  Like everybody that know me know that. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3072.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3073.76s)]
*  They call me and be like, yeah, bro, like, I love you. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3074.6s)]
*  But don't call me with nothing crazy. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3076.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3077.96s)]
*  I wanted to ask, you know, how was that? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3078.8s)]
*  Because you're a very private, very private person, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3080.36s)]
*  but that was so public. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3082.48s)]
*  Did that irk you at all? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3083.76s)]
*  Like everybody in your business talking about you? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3084.92s)]
*  Well, I had to come to the realization [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3088.96s)]
*  that I know who I am [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3091.76s)]
*  and that nobody else can't tell me different. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3094.16s)]
*  So as long as I stayed on the path of integrity [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3096.4s)]
*  and staying true to myself, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3099.76s)]
*  it wasn't nothing really to worry about [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3100.84s)]
*  because anybody that know me, like, I mean, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3102.2s)]
*  I even heard y'all was up here like, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3103.96s)]
*  no, I know GZ, you know that. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3105.72s)]
*  But that's because my reputation exceeds me. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3108.08s)]
*  I'm like, I ain't on nothing. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3110.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3113.16s)]
*  That's how I need to be. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3114.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3114.84s)]
*  And I'm not. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3115.68s)]
*  So it just like, it comes with the territory. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3116.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3119.88s)]
*  He who wears the crown, it's just like, you know, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3120.72s)]
*  people talked about Jesus, you know what I'm saying? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3123.48s)]
*  They gonna talk about everybody. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3125.52s)]
*  Everybody's not gonna like you. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3126.56s)]
*  Now, if I'm a good person to you and you don't like me, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3127.6s)]
*  then there's a problem. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3130.72s)]
*  But if you don't like me because of what you heard [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3132.4s)]
*  or what you think, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3134.56s)]
*  then I ain't none of my spiritual business. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3135.44s)]
*  I can't do nothing about that. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3136.96s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3138.04s)]
*  I can't even convince you [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3138.88s)]
*  because your mind is made up. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3139.72s)]
*  However, if you know me and we had some type of interaction [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3141.08s)]
*  and I haven't done anything wrong to you, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3146.08s)]
*  then that says more about you than me. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3148.08s)]
*  Because now you're judging me. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3150.72s)]
*  There's no judgment here. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3152.64s)]
*  Because I'm not perfect by far. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3153.64s)]
*  But if I haven't done anything to you, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3155.4399999999996s)]
*  then you can't take that position. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3158.0s)]
*  Because, you know, the people around me [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3160.12s)]
*  got real love for me and my friends and my circle. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3162.6s)]
*  Like I never felt any type of just, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3166.12s)]
*  but the people who weren't for me, of course. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3169.04s)]
*  And that did me a solid. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3171.12s)]
*  Now I ain't got to even worry about cutting you off. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3173.08s)]
*  Cut yourself off. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3175.24s)]
*  Right? You know what I'm saying? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3176.08s)]
*  Would you rather get married again? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3177.28s)]
*  Woo, you hit me up. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3178.64s)]
*  I'm gonna be all the way honest. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3180.0s)]
*  I love my freedom. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3181.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3183.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3183.88s)]
*  And that has nothing to do with anything in the past. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3184.72s)]
*  I just love my freedom. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3189.72s)]
*  I got you. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3190.96s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3191.8s)]
*  Like I love it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3192.64s)]
*  You know, I think life partners are amazing. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3193.48s)]
*  You know? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3195.4s)]
*  I would think so. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3196.24s)]
*  How did you feel when the internet said [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3197.7999999999997s)]
*  you was trying to holla at me along by any means necessary? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3199.04s)]
*  They weren't lying. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3201.72s)]
*  It was not lying. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3202.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3205.16s)]
*  You said real **** don't cheat. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3206.0s)]
*  They don't lie. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3207.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3208.48s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3209.48s)]
*  She said, really? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3210.3199999999997s)]
*  You said, hell no. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3211.16s)]
*  But what I went was real men. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3212.0s)]
*  I never cheated. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3214.24s)]
*  Why, why, why? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3215.08s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3215.92s)]
*  No, I don't cheat. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3216.7599999999998s)]
*  What you mean not like that? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3217.6s)]
*  I'm saying like that's low hanging fruit. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3218.44s)]
*  If I'm locked in, I'm locked in. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3219.7599999999998s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3225.56s)]
*  That ain't in my blood. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3226.7200000000003s)]
*  That's real. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3227.56s)]
*  But when you say I was trying to holla, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3228.4s)]

*  will tell us soon enough what he is going through [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3537.96s)]
*  and what he has been through. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3539.68s)]
*  Now Deion Sanders did speak out about his health [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3541.72s)]
*  not too long ago, it was May 30th, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3544.8799999999997s)]
*  he was on Say What Needs to Be Said with Asante Samuel. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3546.6s)]
*  Let's take a listen to that. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3549.9199999999996s)]
*  I hope you're feeling better. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3551.3999999999996s)]
*  And one thing I wanted to say, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3552.48s)]
*  have you ever tried to fast before you ever fast, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3553.64s)]
*  used fasting? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3555.72s)]
*  Yeah, I have, but what I'm dealing with right now [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3556.56s)]
*  is holding a level. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3559.6s)]
*  It's that, holding a level. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3561.12s)]
*  And you know what, honestly, I've done no media, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3562.68s)]
*  I've done nothing for how long now? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3565.68s)]
*  For a minute. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3568.3599999999997s)]
*  So coming on with you is something [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3569.2s)]
*  I ain't been in front of nobody for a minute. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3571.0s)]
*  See, I lost my 42 pounds, like I'm coming back, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3572.88s)]
*  but I needed this, man. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3577.16s)]
*  I needed this exchange. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3578.48s)]
*  Need that energy. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3579.32s)]
*  I need that energy. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3580.16s)]
*  Yeah, because I haven't had the energy. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3581.0s)]
*  I got red, you know, I dorsed this suit so far. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3582.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3584.64s)]
*  But I appreciate it, I needed this. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3586.4s)]
*  I needed this interaction. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3587.64s)]
*  Sending nothing but healing energy to prime time, man. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3589.2400000000002s)]
*  Absolutely, shout to Coach Prime. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3591.6s)]
*  Hopefully feeling better, man. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3593.04s)]
*  Yes, hopefully so. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3594.32s)]
*  And I will say too, Deion Sanders Jr. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3596.32s)]
*  Cause people were wondering too [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3598.8s)]
*  when he was gonna go over to the camps. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3599.72s)]
*  And he said he's waiting for his dad, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3601.3599999999997s)]
*  and then he'll head on over to the camps [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3602.68s)]
*  once his dad is going as well too. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3604.56s)]
*  Gotcha. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3606.9599999999996s)]
*  Now in other news, Simon Gwabaria. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3607.7999999999997s)]
*  Gwabaria. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3612.3199999999997s)]
*  Gwabaria. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3613.16s)]
*  Gwabaria in that name, that's what you're doing. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3614.0s)]
*  Always. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3615.48s)]
*  The estranged husband of Portia Williams [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3617.2s)]
*  from World Housewives of Atlanta [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3620.2s)]
*  has been deported to Nigeria. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3621.68s)]
*  So y'all remember back in February, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3623.48s)]
*  he was taken into ICE custody. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3625.48s)]
*  And it was a big deal because him and Portia [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3627.3999999999996s)]
*  had been going back and forth with this whole divorce [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3628.92s)]
*  and all the things. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3630.64s)]
*  Well, Simon's business partner, a woman named Tays Sabet, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3632.2400000000002s)]
*  told us weekly that it went down. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3635.4s)]
*  And she didn't specify when it happened, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3638.48s)]
*  but I spoke to a source, shout out to Michelle Atleon, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3640.4s)]
*  who was a big blogger in Atlanta. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3644.16s)]
*  I spoke to her who told me it actually happened Friday. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3646.7200000000003s)]
*  They moved him from one location [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3649.64s)]
*  where he was originally detained to Atlanta. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3651.28s)]
*  And now he's no longer listed in the homeland securities [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3654.16s)]
*  like ICE system. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3658.2s)]
*  So he's officially no longer in their custody [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3659.2s)]
*  because he was deported. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3661.8399999999997s)]
*  Now they asked her how he was feeling. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3663.24s)]
*  She says that he's in good spirits [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3665.96s)]
*  and that he's not mad at Donald Trump. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3667.24s)]
*  He actually wants to sit down [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3669.08s)]
*  and have a conversation with Donald Trump. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3670.48s)]
*  Nigeria is a beautiful country, okay? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3672.0s)]
*  People go to Nigeria to vacation, all right? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3673.8799999999997s)]
*  So there's much worse places he could be deported to. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3676.6s)]
*  Very much so. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3679.12s)]
*  Now Salvador prison if he wants to visit, okay, Nigeria? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3680.96s)]
*  Ain't he from Nigeria? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3684.4399999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3685.3199999999997s)]
*  He's from Nigeria. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3686.16s)]
*  I also was told that he has a dual citizenship [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3687.0s)]
*  in Dubai as well. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3689.04s)]
*  But he was saying- [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3691.48s)]
*  I wonder how that works though. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3692.32s)]
*  Like when you get deported to another country, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3693.16s)]
*  are you allowed to just go back and forth? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3694.6s)]
*  Deported to your country? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3696.8s)]
*  Deported to your country. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3697.64s)]
*  He's a citizen of Dubai and Nigeria. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3699.04s)]
*  So he can go back and forth. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3701.12s)]
*  He just can't come here. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3701.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3703.2s)]
*  So he had a choice? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3704.04s)]
*  He could have left. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3704.88s)]
*  He could have left Nigeria and Dubai? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3705.7s)]
*  I don't know if they gave him the option [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3706.54s)]
*  of where he wanted to go or not. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3708.16s)]
*  But I did ask that question [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3709.68s)]
*  and I was told that he can go back and forth [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3710.92s)]
*  between Dubai or anywhere. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3712.12s)]
*  He just cannot come here as to what Envy said. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3712.96s)]
*  But the reason why they asked him [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3716.36s)]
*  about the whole Trump situation is because [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3718.44s)]
*  when he was taken in, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3719.76s)]
*  he was taken in as a part of the government's [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3721.7000000000003s)]
*  huge sweep that was happening. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3724.56s)]
*  And then they created these shirts [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3726.2400000000002s)]
*  trying to help other people [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3728.04s)]
*  who are going through issues with ICE [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3728.88s)]
*  get money for lawyers and all that stuff. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3730.44s)]
*  But fast forward, people are probably like, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3732.08s)]
*  well, how does this play into the divorce [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3734.28s)]
*  or what they're going through? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3735.8s)]
*  So him and Portia, I'm told, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3736.76s)]
*  are actually going to be in court today [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3738.1600000000003s)]
*  figuring out some things. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3741.1600000000003s)]
*  And he's gonna appear in court via Zoom. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3742.44s)]
*  He was, of course, giving permission to, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3745.68s)]
*  both of them would be via Zoom. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3747.52s)]
*  They were given permission to do so [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3749.36s)]
*  because of the circumstances. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3750.84s)]
*  But they're gonna be hashing some things out still. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3752.34s)]
*  He got some stuff he needs to, they gotta figure out. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3754.8s)]
*  That's gonna drive him crazy [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3756.92s)]
*  to see Portia on that Zoom looking good. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3758.04s)]
*  You know Portia gonna be on that Zoom looking good. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3759.88s)]
*  That's what's gonna make him [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3761.7599999999998s)]
*  try to get back into the country. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3762.6s)]
*  Okay? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3763.88s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3764.72s)]
*  Right? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3765.54s)]
*  That's what's gonna make him wanna be back in the country. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3766.38s)]
*  Okay? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3769.12s)]
*  Well, I was also told that he agreed originally to the, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3769.96s)]
*  cause remember when Portia was here [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3772.02s)]
*  and on the show, [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3773.28s)]
*  I don't remember when all the things happened. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3774.12s)]
*  She had been saying that, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3775.88s)]
*  cause we were trying to blame her [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3776.72s)]
*  for the reason why he had gotten deported. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3778.2s)]
*  And from what I was told was that actually [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3780.04s)]
*  he agreed to the deportation order [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3782.2s)]
*  because he didn't wanna fight it. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3784.4s)]
*  He would have been detained for longer. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3785.56s)]
*  So he just agreed. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3787.24s)]
*  But you mean agreed. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3788.08s)]
*  That man said, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3788.9s)]
*  he ain't got no choice. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3789.74s)]
*  He's like, he could have fought it [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3790.58s)]
*  and he could have stayed there, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3791.42s)]
*  but he just wanted to be, just get me out of here. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3792.92s)]
*  From what I'm told, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3794.24s)]
*  He could have fought it if he wanted to [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3795.08s)]
*  because he's been in the US for 35 years. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3798.92s)]
*  My source says he actually has a green card. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3801.52s)]
*  They confiscated all of his things, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3804.36s)]
*  his laptops, his computers, and all these things, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3805.88s)]
*  trying to find what they alleged were gonna be scams. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3807.76s)]
*  And according to the person I spoke to, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3810.1200000000003s)]
*  they found nothing. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3812.0s)]
*  So he could have fought it from what I'm presented with. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3812.82s)]
*  And he decided not to, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3815.44s)]
*  cause he would have been sitting longer. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3816.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3818.52s)]
*  Nigerians don't really be doing that no more. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3819.36s)]
*  What's the point? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3821.52s)]
*  Scamming like that. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3822.36s)]
*  You all scam. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3823.8s)]
*  I remember you getting emails all the time. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3824.6400000000003s)]
*  I haven't seen you in a while. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3826.76s)]
*  I think that's a whole stereotype. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3827.6000000000004s)]
*  That ain't doing nothing. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3829.1600000000003s)]
*  Like Charlamagne said, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3831.0s)]
*  he can go to Nigeria, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3832.04s)]
*  he can go to Dubai. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3833.2799999999997s)]
*  As long as it ain't a prison in El Salvador, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3834.12s)]
*  he'd be hot. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3835.52s)]
*  Yeah. Jeff said what? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3836.3599999999997s)]
*  Trying to stay? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3837.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3838.8399999999997s)]
*  I thought he was talking about [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3839.68s)]
*  he'd be trying to stay over here. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3840.72s)]
*  And for all the people that think the country [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3841.56s)]
*  is trending downward, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3843.24s)]
*  you know, there's people looking for places to go. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3844.08s)]
*  You know? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3847.2799999999997s)]

*  Well, remember when she was here, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3873.48s)]
*  she said that she still wasn't allowed to film in the house. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3875.0s)]
*  And there's still a lot of things. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3878.52s)]
*  But there's still a lot of things legally in place [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3880.04s)]
*  that she has to abide by [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3881.64s)]

*  They don't do all that? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3920.68s)]
*  It depends on the reason you get deported. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3922.16s)]
*  Nah, Simon will buy the, I have no idea. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3923.8799999999997s)]

*  then I'm sure they do that. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3926.56s)]

*  Well, sexy red, donkey of the day for Wednesday, June 11th, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3987.88s)]
*  goes the hit maker Youngberg. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3991.24s)]
*  You know who I'm talking about. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3992.92s)]
*  Renowned producer. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3994.04s)]
*  Okay, I saw an article this morning on a site called Flaunt, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3995.4s)]
*  and they did a story on him, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3998.0s)]
*  and the headline was 77 million sold, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=3999.36s)]
*  nine Grammy nominations, nine billion streams. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4002.1s)]
*  So congratulations to that young man. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4004.68s)]
*  Drop one of Clue's bombs for Youngberg, hit maker. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4006.3999999999996s)]
*  He is a super producer in every sense of the word. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4008.68s)]
*  But as you all know, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4011.2799999999997s)]
*  the donkey of the day does not discriminate. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4012.12s)]
*  See, this past weekend was BET Awards Weekend in LA. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4013.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, the Breakfast Club sent our very own Lauren LaRosa. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4017.3999999999996s)]
*  LL Cool Bae, she was out there [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4020.44s)]
*  working what we call the media room, okay? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4022.72s)]
*  I was born in 1978, been doing radio for 27 years, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4025.04s)]
*  so I'm old enough to remember [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4028.8399999999997s)]
*  when it was just called the radio room. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4030.08s)]
*  Okay, all the different radio stations and radio shows [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4031.7999999999997s)]
*  from across the country with being there, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4034.04s)]
*  interviewing various artists. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4036.04s)]
*  Well, times have changed. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4037.66s)]
*  Okay, the landscape has evolved, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4038.88s)]
*  so now it's radio and podcasts, blogs, sites, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4040.2s)]
*  all types of media. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4042.64s)]
*  So we had Lauren LaRosa out there. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4043.46s)]
*  She interviewed like 30 different people. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4045.44s)]
*  Yeah, 30 different people within two days, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4048.12s)]
*  and I was catching up on some of the interviews this week. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4049.8s)]
*  I saw Jermaine Dupri, I saw Sierra, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4052.2s)]
*  I saw Buju Bantan, all great conversations. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4055.04s)]
*  Drop one of Clue's bombs for Lauren LaRosa. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4058.0s)]
*  Great job. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4060.32s)]
*  But it was the interview with Youngberg, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4061.7599999999998s)]
*  the hit maker, that I wish I was present for. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4064.7000000000003s)]
*  See, hit maker sat down and he was expressing the fact [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4067.1600000000003s)]
*  that he believes Diddy should be free. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4069.5800000000004s)]
*  Nothing wrong with that opinion. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4071.88s)]
*  I'm sure Diddy is praying that there are people on the jury [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4073.46s)]
*  who feel just like hit maker. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4076.44s)]
*  Now, none of us are legal experts, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4078.26s)]
*  but when someone says to me [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4080.04s)]
*  they think Diddy should be free, I ask why. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4081.5s)]
*  When somebody tells me [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4084.78s)]
*  they think Diddy should be locked up, I also ask why. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4085.7200000000003s)]
*  Because if you make statements like that, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4089.48s)]
*  they should be rooted in some information about the case. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4091.0800000000004s)]
*  If they are rooted in your own personal feelings, [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4094.76s)]
*  just because No Way Out is your favorite album, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4097.0s)]
*  that's not a good enough reason. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4099.08s)]
*  I know you had some great nights on Siroc, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4100.320000000001s)]
*  I enjoyed making the band too. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4102.84s)]
*  You cannot erase what Diddy brought to the world [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4104.6s)]
*  of entertainment and lifestyle, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4107.0s)]
*  but none of that has any bearing on his case. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4108.56s)]
*  But let's listen to what hit maker's reasoning was. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4110.72s)]
*  But what is he really guilty of? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4114.360000000001s)]
*  I don't think he should be in jail. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4115.6s)]
*  Why don't you think he should be in jail? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4118.12s)]
*  He's just a freaky ass, you know, N-word. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4119.2s)]
*  He's just a freak. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4123.44s)]
*  Free him, I ain't gonna lie, free him. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4124.36s)]
*  I don't approve of nothing that he did or whatever, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4126.5599999999995s)]
*  but I just think that he was just doing some nasty stuff, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4128.44s)]
*  bro, from what I heard. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4132.48s)]
*  I might not have all the intel, you got all the intel, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4133.639999999999s)]
*  but I think he was just high and tripping. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4135.639999999999s)]
*  That's all it really is. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4138.36s)]
*  But in my personal opinion, Lauren, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4139.44s)]
*  I think that I don't have enough details, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4141.2s)]
*  but I honestly think that he should be in these streets. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4144.28s)]
*  Be in these streets. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4148.2s)]
*  He should be at home. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4149.04s)]
*  He shouldn't be, like, I think that, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4151.08s)]
*  if you think about the Epstein [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4153.16s)]
*  and all the other different people, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4154.5199999999995s)]
*  didn't they get house arrest or something like that? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4156.04s)]
*  Ah, hit maker, you should have stopped that [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4158.08s)]
*  I don't have all the intel. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4160.599999999999s)]
*  You said out of your own mouth [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4161.96s)]
*  you didn't have all the details, yet you kept talking. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4164.08s)]
*  Listen to me, if you ever thought to yourself [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4167.5599999999995s)]
*  the opinions you read on social media [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4169.24s)]
*  couldn't possibly exist in real life, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4171.16s)]
*  then you now have exhibit A. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4173.04s)]
*  Okay, hit maker gave us all [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4174.72s)]
*  the YouTube lawyers greatest hits. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4176.36s)]
*  I don't approve of what he did, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4178.4s)]
*  but he shouldn't be in prison. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4180.28s)]
*  He was just freaky. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4181.5599999999995s)]
*  And what about Epstein? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4182.8s)]
*  What about him? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4184.12s)]
*  Did Epstein get house arrest? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4185.56s)]
*  That's the question you asked. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4187.08s)]
*  The answer is no, okay? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4188.320000000001s)]
*  Not for his 2019 federal sex trafficking charges. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4190.52s)]
*  Okay, he requested release on bail. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4193.64s)]
*  He offered to wear an ankle monitor [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4195.6s)]
*  and stay posted up at his Manhattan mansion, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4197.4800000000005s)]
*  but the judge denied him, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4199.96s)]
*  said he was too big a flight risk and a public danger. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4201.92s)]
*  These are just simple facts that one can research [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4205.56s)]
*  if they choose to. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4208.24s)]
*  Once again, you can have your opinion [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4209.56s)]
*  on whether Diddy should be free or not, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4211.56s)]
*  but if you're gonna express that opinion publicly, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4213.120000000001s)]
*  let it be rooted in something real, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4215.84s)]
*  some type of factual information. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4217.72s)]
*  Now, none of what you heard just now is the reason [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4219.4800000000005s)]
*  I chose to give hit maker donkey here today, okay? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4222.6s)]
*  It was this statement he made [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4225.160000000001s)]
*  as him and Lauren LaRosa were going back and forth [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4227.080000000001s)]
*  on the Diddy situation in regards to the man [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4229.360000000001s)]
*  who killed George Floyd, Derek Chauvin. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4232.56s)]
*  Let's listen. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4235.8s)]
*  Yo, man, I just think that, you know, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4237.0s)]
*  it's kinda crazy and it's very like insane [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4240.32s)]
*  what he got going on, but I've seen, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4243.96s)]
*  like it's people that, the guy on George Floyd neck, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4245.719999999999s)]
*  is he in jail? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4249.16s)]
*  I think, no, I don't think he was in jail. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4250.639999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4253.04s)]
*  Play that one more time. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4255.639999999999s)]
*  Just one more time, play that one more time for me. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4256.48s)]
*  Yo, man, I just think that, you know, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4258.44s)]
*  it's kinda crazy and it's very like insane [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4261.759999999999s)]
*  what he got going on, but I've seen, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4265.44s)]
*  like it's people that, the guy on George Floyd neck, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4267.16s)]
*  is he in jail? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4270.599999999999s)]
*  I think, no, I don't think he was in jail. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4272.08s)]
*  Damn. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4274.28s)]
*  You know, hit maker said he didn't have much information [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4275.96s)]
*  on the Diddy case. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4278.4s)]
*  Hit maker, you don't seem to have much information [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4279.599999999999s)]
*  on anything, okay? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4281.599999999999s)]
*  I don't understand how people speak about things [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4282.76s)]
*  they don't know anything about with such confidence. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4285.32s)]
*  What do you mean is the guy who killed George Floyd [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4288.44s)]
*  in prison? [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4292.88s)]
*  Derek Chauvin got 43 years. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4294.28s)]
*  Okay, 22 and a half years in state prison [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4296.12s)]
*  for unintentional second degree murder. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4298.4s)]
*  I don't even know how it was ruled, unintentional, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4300.04s)]
*  but the sentence exceeded the standard guideline [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4302.12s)]
*  due to Derek's abuse of authority and the cruelty displayed. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4304.72s)]
*  Then he got sentenced federally, the 21 years, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4308.6s)]
*  for violating George Floyd's civil rights, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4311.5199999999995s)]

*  even after he became unresponsive, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4314.76s)]

*  adding up to 43 years. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4319.4s)]
*  Hit maker, you don't even know, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4322.28s)]
*  you don't even need to know all those details, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4323.8s)]

*  George Floyd's killer was in prison, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4329.2s)]

*  He had a winning hand when he said that. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4342.4800000000005s)]
*  Like he said it like he had the big joker, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4344.12s)]
*  the low joker, the deuce of diamonds, ace of spades. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4345.88s)]

*  then find some cases that are the equivalent [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4357.5599999999995s)]
*  of Sean Combs'. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4360.32s)]

*  who was charged with sex trafficking [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4363.88s)]
*  and interstate prostitution, is a way better example, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4365.36s)]
*  but that's not the debate. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4368.04s)]
*  Hit maker, how you don't know Derek Chauvin is in prison? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4369.32s)]

*  I was gonna say it was off the top of the dome, but. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4508.88s)]
*  Look what you said in the story. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4510.96s)]
*  Now, I did see a video, before we get into politics, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4511.8s)]
*  I did see a video, you were in the video, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4514.04s)]
*  and you were in the video, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4515.8s)]
*  I did see a video, you were a rapper. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4517.200000000001s)]
*  You got a bop, you got a bop on your hand. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4519.0s)]
*  I was an aspiring rapper. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4521.400000000001s)]
*  Aspiring rapper. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4522.8s)]
*  Nobody would vote for you based off what I heard. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4523.8s)]
*  And that's why I'm not a rapper. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4526.64s)]
*  Based off the quality of that rap, nobody would vote for me. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4528.400000000001s)]
*  To be the mayor, you have to know what you know [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4532.0s)]
*  and know what you don't know. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4533.56s)]
*  And I learned quickly what I didn't know. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4534.92s)]
*  You really wanted to pursue a rap career at one point? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4536.240000000001s)]
*  There was a point, there was a point. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4538.88s)]
*  I mean, it was at the level, [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4540.320000000001s)]
*  so I was born in Kampala, Uganda, in East Africa. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4541.64s)]
*  And there was a point where there was a guy I grew up with, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4544.96s)]
*  he's like my brother, the two of us were rapping together. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4546.96s)]
*  And I was trying to sell mixtapes on a public bus, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4550.2s)]
*  which doesn't leave until it fills every single one [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4554.56s)]
*  of the 14 seats. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4556.4400000000005s)]
*  That's how much we were trying. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4558.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4559.68s)]
*  And here I am, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4560.6s)]
*  because it didn't really work out all that well. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4561.4400000000005s)]
*  It was kind of like yin-yang twins, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4562.8s)]
*  but they were his friends. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4564.0s)]
*  I liked it, I heard them. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4564.84s)]
*  I was surprised. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4565.68s)]
*  I liked it. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4566.52s)]
*  Was there an inspiration for you, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4567.36s)]
*  the yin-yang twins, the whisper song? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4568.56s)]
*  I have to say, that was an inspiration [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4569.88s)]
*  for the song I made called Nani. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4571.0s)]
*  But I think for me, it was also a way [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4573.4800000000005s)]
*  of just telling the different stories of what I grew up with. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4577.320000000001s)]
*  And especially in Kampala, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4579.8s)]
*  I'm Ugandan of Indian origin. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4582.160000000001s)]
*  The guy that I grew up with, his name is Abdul, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4584.76s)]
*  he is Ugandan by way of South Sudan. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4586.52s)]
*  It's all these different cultures coming together. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4589.200000000001s)]
*  We were trying to mix it all in. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4590.64s)]
*  And then when I was here in New York City, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4592.400000000001s)]
*  just trying to kind of, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4594.400000000001s)]
*  the song that I made was a testament to my grandmother, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4595.92s)]
*  how she's a real badass. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4598.56s)]
*  And how so often when we talk about our elders, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4599.8s)]
*  we put them in a box of a nice, gentle person [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4601.68s)]
*  who is very much constrained in how we imagine them. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4603.96s)]
*  And I wanted to just be a little more absurd [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4607.56s)]
*  in the celebration of a woman who gave me a sense [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4609.6s)]
*  of the world and was a social worker [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4612.4800000000005s)]
*  and should be a little more celebrated. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4614.52s)]
*  And disciplined you. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4616.16s)]
*  Love that. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4617.0s)]
*  And disciplined you. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4617.84s)]
*  A few slaps in Jackson Heights hurt nobody. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4618.68s)]
*  Oh, you got slapped? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4620.320000000001s)]
*  In the video. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4621.16s)]
*  You got old school discipline. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4622.0s)]
*  That's what's up. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4622.84s)]
*  In that video, not by my grandmother. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4623.68s)]
*  So question, in real life, when you do make the pivot [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4625.52s)]
*  to do what it is you're doing now, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4627.68s)]
*  do you say to yourself, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4629.4800000000005s)]
*  all right, scrub all that off the internet. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4630.599999999999s)]
*  We gotta get rid of that. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4631.719999999999s)]
*  No, because I think that it's about being a real person. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4632.839999999999s)]
*  Like I enjoyed that time in my life. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4636.08s)]
*  And ultimately I actually see a through line [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4638.24s)]
*  between that work and this work [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4639.919999999999s)]
*  in that you're trying to tell a story. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4641.759999999999s)]
*  And when you're trying to sell a mixtape [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4643.719999999999s)]
*  or you're trying to get somebody's signature [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4646.04s)]
*  to get on the ballot at 6.30 in the morning [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4647.36s)]
*  at the Broadway stop with an NW and Astoria, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4650.28s)]
*  it's the same thing where you're asking someone, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4652.599999999999s)]
*  can I have a moment of your time to tell you [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4654.4s)]
*  about my story or our story? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4656.719999999999s)]
*  And it also means learning how to deal [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4659.44s)]
*  with rejection very quickly. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4661.2s)]
*  Because once you've tried to be an artist, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4662.919999999999s)]
*  once you tried to be a rapper, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4665.679999999999s)]
*  you know what it means to be humbled [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4666.5199999999995s)]
*  on a regular basis. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4669.5199999999995s)]
*  You know what it means to be the opener to the opener [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4671.12s)]
*  to the opener to the opener to the opener. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4673.32s)]
*  And I think too often in politics, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4675.28s)]
*  there's a real sense of self [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4677.04s)]
*  as if people should be excited to see you [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4678.879999999999s)]
*  when in fact you should be excited to see them. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4681.24s)]
*  We shouldn't be lecturing people [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4683.0s)]
*  as much as we should actually be listening to them. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4684.4s)]
*  And I think that struggling through being an artist, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4686.4s)]
*  it was very helpful in learning that. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4689.5599999999995s)]
*  What got you into politics? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4691.2s)]
*  Because some of your policies that you want [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4692.44s)]
*  and we'll discuss, I don't see happening, but I love it. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4693.599999999999s)]
*  So let's start how you got into politics at first. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4696.599999999999s)]
*  So the first time I knocked on doors was in 2008 for Obama. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4698.92s)]
*  The first time I knocked on doors in New York City [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4703.2s)]
*  was when I picked up a copy of the Village Voice [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4705.32s)]
*  and I saw that one of my favorite rappers, Heems, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4707.04s)]
*  had endorsed his childhood friend for city council. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4709.4s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this guy would be the first [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4712.48s)]
*  South Asian elected official in New York City. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4714.12s)]
*  And I was like, oh, he's not gonna be in New York City. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4716.92s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's not gonna happen. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4718.84s)]
*  And I was like, oh, he's not gonna be in New York City. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4720.8s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's not gonna happen. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4722.96s)]
*  And then I got on the F train and I went to 169th [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4724.599999999999s)]
*  and I knocked on doors for Ali. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4726.96s)]
*  And that was the moment where I started to get involved [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4728.599999999999s)]
*  in local politics. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4730.96s)]
*  I joined a club called the Muslim Democratic Club in New York. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4731.8s)]
*  And then in 2017, I worked on my first race. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4734.639999999999s)]
*  That was for a Palestinian Lutheran minister in Bay Ridge [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4737.36s)]
*  called the Elia Team. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4740.44s)]
*  And that just changed my life [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4741.84s)]
*  because I moved to this city when I was seven. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4743.08s)]
*  And I had a place in New York City politics. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4746.4400000000005s)]
*  I thought those two things were separate. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4747.68s)]
*  And then there was this campaign which showed me [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4749.16s)]
*  that there was room for all of us. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4750.84s)]
*  And you didn't actually have to give up any of yourself [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4752.68s)]
*  to be a part of it. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4754.8s)]
*  And that inspired me to understand that politics [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4756.12s)]
*  isn't just something that you believe in, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4759.56s)]
*  it's also something that you do as an active thing. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4761.56s)]
*  And from there, I kept working on campaigns. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4764.68s)]
*  And then in 2020, I ran for the state assembly [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4767.08s)]
*  and now I represent a story in Long Island City. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4769.4400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4771.4400000000005s)]
*  The USA today asked a question. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4772.32s)]
*  And the question is simple. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4775.679999999999s)]
*  Can an AOC-backed socialist upset Andrew Cuomo [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4776.8s)]
*  in the New York City's mayor race? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4780.639999999999s)]
*  I want you to answer that question. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4782.2s)]
*  There's a short answer, which is yes. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4783.719999999999s)]
*  And there's a longer answer, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4785.599999999999s)]
*  which is the fact that New Yorkers are hungry [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4786.84s)]
*  for a different kind of politics. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4789.92s)]
*  We have seen the same politicians with the same ideas [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4791.759999999999s)]
*  lead us to the same results for decades. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4794.5199999999995s)]
*  And this is in many ways a question [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4796.719999999999s)]
*  of whether we want to go back to the past [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4798.28s)]
*  or whether we want to go to the future. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4800.6s)]
*  And our campaign is one that sees this city [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4802.4400000000005s)]
*  under attack in two ways. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4806.200000000001s)]
*  An affordability crisis on the inside, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4808.04s)]
*  we're the most expensive city in the United States of America. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4810.200000000001s)]
*  One in four New Yorkers are living in poverty. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4812.72s)]
*  The rest are living in a permanent state of anxiety [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4814.92s)]
*  about whether they can keep affording this city. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4817.360000000001s)]
*  And then we're under attack from the outside [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4819.160000000001s)]
*  from a Trump administration that is hell bent [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4820.52s)]
*  on going after not only New Yorkers, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4823.200000000001s)]
*  but frankly, democratic cities across the country, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4824.96s)]
*  like we're seeing in Los Angeles right now. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4827.84s)]
*  And I am going head to head with Andrew Cuomo, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4830.04s)]
*  a former governor who's the son of a former governor, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4833.68s)]
*  whose super PAC is funded in large part [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4836.36s)]
*  by the same billionaires [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4838.88s)]
*  who put Donald Trump back in the White House. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4840.04s)]
*  That's not the kind of person who can stand up [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4842.24s)]
*  to authoritarianism without seeing a reflection of themselves. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4846.4s)]
*  We need someone who will actually fight [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4849.68s)]
*  both of these crises at the same time. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4851.36s)]
*  And that's why I believe that I can win. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4852.84s)]
*  And I'm so excited to have Congressman Ocasio-Cortez's [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4854.8s)]
*  endorsement in doing that. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4857.16s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Zoran Kwame Mamdani. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4858.56s)]
*  He's running for mayor of New York City. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4861.200000000001s)]
*  If you were the mayor and you see what's going on in LA, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4863.160000000001s)]
*  how would you handle that problem? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4865.96s)]
*  If there was protesters, they were breaking stuff, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4867.160000000001s)]
*  looting, smashing police cars, vandalizing things, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4870.6s)]
*  of course, Trump sending the troops. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4874.68s)]
*  How would you handle that if you were mayor of New York City [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4877.200000000001s)]
*  and that actually happened here? [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4879.4400000000005s)]
*  I think first and foremost, you call it what it is. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4880.96s)]
*  It's authoritarianism. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4883.280000000001s)]
*  This is the way from his pregnant wife, Nora, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4884.72s)]
*  and has since been in an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4887.4s)]
*  It wasn't able to even witness the birth [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4889.599999999999s)]
*  of his first child, Dean. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4891.759999999999s)]
*  And we have another New York City public high school student [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4894.0s)]
*  named Dylan, who was snatched at a regular check-in [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4896.28s)]
*  at Federal Plaza, is now hundreds of miles away [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4900.5199999999995s)]
*  from his mother and his two siblings. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4903.28s)]
*  And this is personal for me because I got my citizenship [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4905.32s)]
*  just blocks from where those arrests are happening. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4908.44s)]
*  Those blocks used to be my favorite part of New York City. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4911.96s)]
*  It's where I got my citizenship, where I got married. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4914.08s)]
*  And those are now the same blocks where, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4916.24s)]
*  when I took my father for his immigration interview, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4918.599999999999s)]
*  this year, I hugged him so tight because I didn't know [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4921.16s)]
*  if I was gonna see him in the afternoon. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4923.96s)]
*  There are too many New Yorkers who are feeling that. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4925.88s)]
*  And so I think you call this what it is. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4927.679999999999s)]
*  You also make clear that Trump is reversing [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4929.8s)]
*  historical precedent in that calling the National Guard [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4932.48s)]
*  is typically something a governor requests of the president. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4935.08s)]
*  It's not something a president puts on a governor. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4938.04s)]
*  And Kathy Hochul is someone who, as the governor [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4940.4s)]
*  of our state, has been able to fight Donald Trump [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4943.8s)]
*  and defend a lot of his potential attacks on this state. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4946.64s)]
*  One of the first things I would do is work with her [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4949.72s)]
*  to make it clear that this has no room in our city. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4951.76s)]
*  And our police force should not be assisting ICE [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4957.08s)]
*  in what they are conducting. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4961.24s)]
*  We recently saw arrests where the NYPD [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4963.12s)]
*  was then arresting a pastor and other New Yorkers [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4966.56s)]
*  who were observing ICE arresting migrants [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4970.360000000001s)]
*  coming in for their check-ins. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4972.4s)]
*  We don't need to be accomplices to authoritarianism. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4974.5599999999995s)]
*  We need to show that there's another way [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4976.719999999999s)]
*  of running this city and this country. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4978.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's who I'm excited to be. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4979.96s)]
*  That's a question, right? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4981.44s)]
*  Why is Donald Trump the Democrats' boogie man? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4982.28s)]
*  Because none of y'all are running against Trump. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4985.5199999999995s)]
*  And to me, the biggest hurdle to the Democratic Party [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4987.44s)]
*  is the Democratic Party. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4989.92s)]
*  The inaction of the Democratic Party over all of these years [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4991.28s)]
*  is the biggest hurdle for the Democratic Party now. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4995.04s)]
*  I don't disagree with you. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=4998.679999999999s)]
*  That's part of my critique of Andrew Cuomo [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5000.2s)]
*  is that he's the very kind of leadership [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5001.76s)]
*  that helped give rise to Donald Trump. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5003.68s)]
*  You know, before Donald Trump was a president of this country, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5005.64s)]
*  before he was a reality TV show host, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5008.0s)]
*  he was a real estate developer in New York City. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5010.8s)]
*  And he was someone who both parties had room for and time for. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5013.240000000001s)]
*  And I think that our ability to accommodate [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5017.8s)]
*  the very kind of real estate developers [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5020.4800000000005s)]
*  that have broken law after law after law [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5022.400000000001s)]
*  is also part of what has given rise [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5024.92s)]
*  to an era of politics with no accountability. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5026.8s)]
*  I mean, Andrew Cuomo had a video of Donald Trump [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5028.96s)]
*  playing at his own bachelor party. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5030.92s)]
*  Like, that's the level in which all of this is a mesh together. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5032.64s)]
*  And I'm trying to chart a new course with this campaign [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5036.2s)]
*  alongside thousands of New Yorkers [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5040.6s)]
*  for a politics that is clearly distinct from that of Donald Trump. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5043.32s)]
*  And I think when New Yorkers are shocked at Donald Trump's record [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5046.8s)]
*  of cutting Medicaid, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5051.88s)]
*  of trying to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from the MTA, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5053.36s)]
*  of giving tax breaks to billionaires, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5056.6s)]
*  of hounding the many women who have credibly come forward to accuse him, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5059.28s)]
*  those are the same things you could say about Andrew Cuomo. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5063.5199999999995s)]
*  We don't need a reflection of that in New York City. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5066.8s)]
*  We need someone who is the opposite of that. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5069.28s)]
*  And as a progressive Muslim immigrant [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5071.76s)]
*  who's willing to fight for the things I believe in, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5074.679999999999s)]
*  that's what makes me Donald Trump's worst nightmare. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5076.679999999999s)]
*  But I saw you say that in the debate, you know, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5079.5599999999995s)]
*  you would be Trump's worst nightmare. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5081.92s)]
*  Once again, why should that matter to anybody voting for you now? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5083.719999999999s)]
*  You're not running against Donald Trump. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5088.56s)]
*  No, but you are running against the authoritarianism [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5090.080000000001s)]
*  that he's bringing to this city. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5092.6s)]
*  So you think Cuomo's an authoritarian? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5093.8s)]
*  No, I think that there's too many commonalities [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5095.76s)]
*  between him and Donald Trump's record. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5097.92s)]
*  And my point is that you don't want to have a mayor [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5100.200000000001s)]
*  who has to pick up a phone call [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5104.200000000001s)]
*  from someone who cut a $250,000 check to both him and Donald Trump. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5106.400000000001s)]
*  You want to have a mayor who's willing to fight for the city [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5110.400000000001s)]
*  and have that be the thing that he's ultimately responsible for. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5113.280000000001s)]
*  And I think to your point, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5115.92s)]
*  we also have to be honest about how we lost this presidential election. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5117.64s)]
*  You know, New York is the state that had the largest swing [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5121.52s)]
*  in the country towards Donald Trump, 11.5 points. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5125.08s)]
*  And it happened far from the caricature of Trump voters. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5128.360000000001s)]
*  It happened in the hearts of immigrant New York City. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5132.4800000000005s)]
*  I went to Fordham Road in the Bronx, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5134.4800000000005s)]
*  I went to Hillside Avenue in Queens, [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5135.92s)]
*  and when I asked New Yorkers there, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5137.320000000001s)]
*  almost all of whom were Democrats, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5138.92s)]
*  who did you vote for and why? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5140.68s)]
*  Many told me they didn't vote. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5142.320000000001s)]
*  Many told me they voted for Trump. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5143.6s)]
*  And they told me they voted for him [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5145.160000000001s)]
*  because they remembered having more money in their pocket four years ago. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5146.16s)]
*  For their rent, for their childcare, for their groceries, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5149.08s)]
*  even for their metrocars. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5151.5599999999995s)]
*  They remember how they feel. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5152.36s)]
*  And as insincere and ridiculous and horrific [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5153.5599999999995s)]
*  as we know Trump's policies to be, that is how people felt. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5156.32s)]
*  Those are the decisions that they made. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5159.599999999999s)]
*  And when I asked these same New Yorkers, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5160.84s)]
*  what would it take to bring you back to the Democratic Party? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5162.36s)]
*  They said a relentless focus on an economic agenda. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5164.92s)]
*  I said, what would you say to a candidate running to freeze the rent, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5167.76s)]
*  make buses fast and free, deliver universal childcare? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5170.5599999999995s)]
*  I said I'd vote for him. And that's when I introduced myself. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5173.08s)]
*  And that's my point here is that there are some Democrats like Andrew Cuomo [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5174.96s)]
*  who think that we went too far left in how we ran a campaign. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5178.52s)]
*  And my point is that we actually betrayed working class voters a long time ago. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5185.64s)]
*  And it's time to own up to that and finally fulfill the promises [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5188.84s)]
*  that were made decades ago. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5191.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's interesting, right? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5192.84s)]
*  Because, you know, you say Cuomo and Trump have so many similarities, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5194.2s)]
*  but Cuomo has been a career Democrat. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5197.08s)]
*  And that's why I feel like anybody who is going to be the future [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5199.4400000000005s)]
*  of the Democratic Party, you do have to throw that old regime under the bus. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5202.88s)]
*  Because it's not just Cuomo. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5206.8s)]
*  That bus is going to be free. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5207.6s)]
*  Oh, sure. But it's not just Cuomo in the Democratic Party. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5209.0s)]
*  It's a lot of old leaders. Absolutely. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5212.32s)]
*  It's the Chuck Schumers. It's the Bidens. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5213.76s)]
*  You got to throw all of that under the bus and run it over. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5216.4400000000005s)]
*  And people have to hear you say that because I keep hearing y'all, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5219.0s)]
*  you know, you keep talking about Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5221.04s)]
*  No, but you. But your party has been just as ineffective [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5223.0s)]
*  and just as corrupt in a lot of ways. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5225.56s)]
*  Trust me, I have. I hear you. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5226.92s)]
*  Because I've been critical about the style of leadership [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5228.88s)]
*  that gave rise to Donald Trump is also a style of leadership [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5232.0s)]
*  within the Democratic Party. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5235.56s)]
*  And I think for too long, it's been a party that has valued insider politics, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5237.04s)]
*  pay your dues, the words and advice of consultants over the people [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5241.2s)]
*  that are Democrats themselves. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5245.36s)]
*  And I do think it's time for a new generation of leadership. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5247.12s)]
*  You know, Cuomo would be the oldest mayor elected in New York City. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5250.48s)]
*  I would represent a completely new generation. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5255.56s)]
*  And I think it's important for that because it's not just about age. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5258.639999999999s)]
*  It's not just about vision. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5262.28s)]
*  It's also about what has your record been and who have you been fighting for? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5263.36s)]
*  And is that distinct enough from what got us here? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5267.36s)]
*  Well, if they want to support you, how can they go out and support you? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5269.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, what I would tell them is come to Zahran for NYC.com. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5271.84s)]
*  Don't donate to us. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5275.08s)]
*  We've already raised the maximum we can spend in this campaign. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5275.92s)]
*  But do give us something more valuable, which is your time. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5278.24s)]
*  We're building a team of 34000 people, New Yorkers from all walks of life [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5280.88s)]

*  It would be a joy to have you. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5287.4s)]
*  And I would also say that three of you want to come campus. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5288.96s)]
*  We'd love to have you as well. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5290.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5292.32s)]
*  Well, we residents of New Jersey. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5293.32s)]
*  But look, you know, just bring that corporate tax rate. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5294.5199999999995s)]
*  Bring that corporate tax rate over from New Jersey. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5297.599999999999s)]
*  When's the election? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5300.44s)]

*  And we're confident we can win this, but only with the help of New Yorkers. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5304.28s)]
*  Well, good luck. Thank you so much. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5307.5199999999995s)]

*  Let's get the polls up. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5320.84s)]
*  There you go. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5321.88s)]
*  It's the Breakfast Club. Good morning. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5322.96s)]
*  The Breakfast Club. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5325.12s)]
*  I'm the homegirl that knows a little bit about everything. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5346.0s)]
*  She'll be having the latest on this. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5348.4s)]
*  The latest with Lauren LaRosa. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5352.44s)]
*  Sometimes you have facts, sometimes you have details, sometimes you have a little bit of everything. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5354.16s)]
*  Oh, it's the latest. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5357.56s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5358.56s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5359.68s)]
*  So taking you out of court real quick. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5361.64s)]
*  R. Kelly is asking to be released. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5363.64s)]
*  He filed an emergency motion for prison release. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5366.32s)]
*  He says he's alleging that prison officials teamed up with a man who is a gang leader, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5369.0s)]
*  who has a terminal illness and a plot to kill him. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5374.44s)]
*  So he is currently in North Carolina serving his 30 years sentence for sex crimes. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5377.4s)]
*  In North Carolina? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5381.36s)]
*  Yes, he's in North Carolina right now serving his 30 year sentence for sex crimes. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5382.4s)]
*  And according to documents that R. Kelly's legal team just filed, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5386.12s)]
*  they're alleging that there is a man last name Stein, who is a gang leader, a big gang leader, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5389.639999999999s)]
*  and that he has provided a sworn statement to them that prison officials offered him his freedom [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5395.36s)]
*  to spend his last days free if he would allegedly kill R. Kelly. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5400.96s)]
*  Now, the way that this man says this was supposed to go down is that he was supposed to kill R. Kelly allegedly, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5405.36s)]
*  and then he would get charged for it. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5410.88s)]
*  And then he alleges that prison officials were going to fumble the evidence and ultimately bury the case. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5412.96s)]
*  They would then allegedly transfer him to another location where he would be allowed to escape and stay free. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5418.2s)]
*  Now, you might want to. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5424.28s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5425.0s)]
*  It does. It does sound crazy. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5426.04s)]
*  That sounds like a Trapped in the Closet series. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5427.68s)]
*  Okay, R. Kelly wrote that. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5429.6s)]
*  Well, you're probably wondering, well, why would all, why, if this has been alleged of the prison officials, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5431.4800000000005s)]
*  why would they want to do all this? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5437.4400000000005s)]
*  Why would they want to kill R. Kelly? [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5438.4800000000005s)]
*  So R. Kelly's team is saying that all this is happening because they've been investigating [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5439.64s)]
*  whether R. Kelly's rights were violated throughout the process of his trials and that they had, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5442.96s)]
*  they've alleged, they're alleging they recovered some information that the information they were [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5448.280000000001s)]
*  and that this information was going to come out. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5452.4800000000005s)]
*  So this is a response allegedly to that. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5454.400000000001s)]
*  And the information basically, Asriel Clary, who was a big witness for R. Kelly's sentencing [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5456.28s)]
*  and a woman named Lashonda, who was a big witness in the Chicago case, these two witnesses, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5462.2s)]
*  according to these documents and according to R. Kelly's legal team, were flipped on R. Kelly [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5466.719999999999s)]
*  based on this in-house informant. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5472.12s)]
*  This in-house informant by the government allegedly went to Asriel Clary, went to Lashonda, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5474.36s)]
*  showed Asriel Clary some communications at R. Kelly, emails, phone calls with another woman outside of Asriel, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5480.36s)]
*  because y'all know she was dating R. Kelly. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5485.76s)]
*  And they alleged that because of the communications that were shown, he then influenced her to [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5487.72s)]
*  be the government's key witness. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5491.4400000000005s)]
*  And then she was able, she was put together with this informant, with the woman Lashonda, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5493.400000000001s)]
*  who then did the same so that the rights were violated. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5498.92s)]
*  They alleged the government act like they didn't have anything to do with it, nor did [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5501.6s)]
*  they know what happened. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5504.16s)]
*  Although they alleged R. Kelly's team was told his communications were stolen during [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5505.320000000001s)]
*  the trial. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5509.52s)]
*  No one knew any details and now they know the details. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5510.72s)]
*  This whole plot has come out. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5512.72s)]
*  And the guy, his name is Mikell, Glenn Stein, he says he will take a lie detector test and [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5514.28s)]
*  he will testify if he has to. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5520.16s)]
*  I don't want to be disrespectful, I really don't care. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5523.0s)]
*  It just sounds like a lot of blah, blah, blah. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5524.8s)]
*  I've tried to get the attorneys on the phone, that's who I was speaking with when I came [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5527.639999999999s)]
*  in here, and I literally said to them, these are some really big claims, it seems like [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5530.36s)]
*  a movie, I would love to speak to someone, and I haven't gotten a call back. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5533.8s)]
*  But this is what they've alleged in these documents. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5536.92s)]
*  And which case is that? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5538.5199999999995s)]
*  Because didn't he have two cases that are concurrent? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5539.5199999999995s)]
*  So which case is that? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5541.76s)]
*  So it's both. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5542.76s)]
*  Both. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5544.280000000001s)]
*  But he's in North Carolina serving the 30, but both. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5545.280000000001s)]
*  Because Asriel was a huge witness in one and Lashonda was a huge witness in Chicago. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5547.56s)]
*  Dang. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5552.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5553.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5554.8s)]
*  Real quick, Diddy, because there's a lot that has been happening, I know we haven't actually [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5555.8s)]
*  been in court, but we've been talking about it. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5560.8s)]
*  That's what I'm interested in, yeah. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5561.8s)]
*  So which part do you want to start with first? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5563.320000000001s)]
*  So Jayden Doe has been on, I guess, she's been talking for the last four days, she's [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5564.88s)]
*  been on trial for four days. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5569.72s)]
*  That's not normal though. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5571.400000000001s)]
*  She's currently paying somebody's rent. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5574.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't even think Cassie had four days. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5575.4400000000005s)]
*  Why did she come in and get them? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5576.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5577.4400000000005s)]
*  They're going to be homeless tonight. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5578.4400000000005s)]
*  There's been a lot that has been said in court. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5579.4400000000005s)]
*  So yes, Jayden Doe is still the same Jayden Doe that we talked about last on Thursday, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5583.6s)]
*  with Thursday and Friday. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5588.160000000001s)]
*  Friday. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5589.160000000001s)]
*  And that's not normal. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5590.160000000001s)]
*  Like you can ask questions. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5592.320000000001s)]
*  There's no like, they don't have like a time limit. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5594.64s)]
*  Like they have to be able to present their cases equally and get their questions out. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5596.72s)]
*  It seems like nothing's new though. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5599.4800000000005s)]
*  It seems like it's the same thing that she's been saying for the last four days, right? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5600.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I think they're dead. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5604.04s)]
*  I mean, at this point, they're just, again, it's beyond a shot of a doubt. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5605.04s)]
*  So just want to add more context, more color to it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5608.0s)]
*  But it has come out that she talks about, you know, not wanting to do freak offs allegedly [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5610.12s)]
*  and you know, wanting to be with Diddy herself. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5614.48s)]
*  Her testimony is very similar to Cassie's where she's like, I didn't want to do these [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5617.759999999999s)]
*  things. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5621.28s)]
*  But she alleges that she did it because she was in love. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5622.28s)]
*  And she alleges that Diddy led her down this path of like drugs and this crazy lifestyle. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5624.44s)]
*  She did mention that Diddy, you know, pays her or was paying her rent. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5629.32s)]
*  And that she's still currently working with an attorney that Diddy originally got her [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5633.12s)]
*  allegedly because she was with him at the time that Cassie video dropped. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5637.96s)]
*  And she alleges that his team was scrambling to figure out an apology or basically what [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5642.6s)]
*  to say. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5646.08s)]
*  And then following that after like, you know, Cassie filed her documents and things of that [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5647.08s)]
*  nature, authority or the government approached her about being a witness or having a conversation. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5650.96s)]
*  So he got her an attorney. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5656.84s)]
*  All of Jane Doe's have been horrible. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5660.2s)]
*  All of Jane Doe's that I've heard, the last two Jane Doe's, they've been horrible. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5661.8s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5664.8s)]
*  Why you say that? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5665.8s)]
*  That one that you were talking about right now, she just sounded like a scorned girl. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5666.8s)]
*  Like a scorned girl. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5670.2s)]
*  She said that. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5671.2s)]
*  Yeah, she said that she was, you know, she wanted to be with him in a bigger way and [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5672.2s)]
*  she was, she felt like she was just used for his like sexual expectations. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5676.400000000001s)]
*  She also say things got a little difficult for them when he started dating Young Miami. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5679.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, she said that she would see Young Miami, you know, being taken out to buy a [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5684.6s)]
*  bag, basically living the life of his girlfriend. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5688.68s)]
*  Everything that she was doing before Young Miami came along. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5691.52s)]
*  And it was difficult for her, even though she alleges that he told her in the beginning [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5693.320000000001s)]
*  that he is dealing with multiple women. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5696.08s)]
*  She says that once she started seeing it, it was difficult for her and you know, that [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5698.320000000001s)]
*  they had their patches as well of like, you know, arguing and you know, different things, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5702.320000000001s)]
*  but she wanted more from him. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5707.76s)]
*  The prosecution should have left it after Capricorn Clock because now it's just like, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5709.400000000001s)]
*  can you find him guilty by a reasonable doubt after you listened to the last couple of weeks? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5713.6s)]
*  I'm not no lawyer. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5718.32s)]
*  I'm just saying, when you put a little bit of doubt in people's minds, that could have [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5719.32s)]
*  one person in that jury be like, eh. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5724.48s)]
*  Now also does it seem like everybody that Dady has dated... [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5727.679999999999s)]
*  That's what you used to call him? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5731.92s)]
*  That's what you used to call him, right? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5732.92s)]
*  Does it seem like everybody that Dady has dated has been involved with these free calls? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5733.92s)]
*  You didn't even say Puff Daddy, you should say Daddy. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5739.719999999999s)]
*  Everybody that Dady has dated. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5742.679999999999s)]

*  They did call him Puff Daddy. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5752.88s)]
*  Yeah, but you just said Daddy. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5753.88s)]
*  I didn't mean Daddy. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5754.88s)]
*  I meant you. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5755.88s)]
*  You're asking me were they all involved in free calls? [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5756.88s)]
*  Yes, that's what it seems like, right? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5759.88s)]
*  Father. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5761.44s)]

*  I can't answer that indefinitely, but the people that we've heard from, they said that [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5774.4s)]
*  like for instance they brought up Ken Porter and they said that he treated Ken Porter differently [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5778.4s)]
*  and that things were different. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5781.4s)]
*  But there have been women that... [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5783.08s)]
*  Cassie and this woman's story are the same. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5785.4s)]

*  And he's trying to get out because he won't talk about daddy no more. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5818.2s)]
*  It's the Breakfast Club. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05FJVkO1jlQ&t=5819.2s)]
