*  Yeah, and let me see that's a big deal for you because you are you know [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1057.34s)]
*  Probably one of the best field journalists out here if not the best the best 100 the best I think you're the best [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1059.98s)]
*  I'll take it. I do and you have the new one of fingers fingers fingers the post [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1065.34s)]
*  Fingers the post maga the next generation that has to affect you. It does. Yeah. Yeah [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1070.14s)]
*  No, I I mean literally if you watch the special right now, you will see i'm only shot from like the the halfway up [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1075.34s)]
*  And if anything gets awry like I can't move or get away from people [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1082.62s)]
*  So it was broke during the special was broke during the special. Oh, you can't do that when you run the magga crowd [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1086.6999999999998s)]
*  Now no offense to the magga crowd, but they're also slow movers too [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1092.22s)]
*  So, you know I can I can usually outmaneuver them [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1095.4199999999998s)]
*  I can use my privilege to lord it over them [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1098.54s)]
*  Or I use the four security guards to get between me and them if things get hairy I enjoyed the special [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1101.1000000000001s)]
*  Um, it's you talking to the the younger I guess generation of maga because 15% of what young men. Yeah [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1106.14s)]
*  Young men shifted right this election [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1113.74s)]
*  There was a shift there was a shift right from the entire youth generation like women shifted right? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1115.74s)]
*  But men especially moved into the magga camp [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1121.02s)]
*  And so we were we're curious why like what was it about that? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1123.5800000000002s)]
*  It doesn't it doesn't feel like the the cool thing on a campus to believe in, you know [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1126.62s)]
*  Anti-abortion reproductive rights or you know essentially the anti-hippie movement, but but there was a movement so we're like, let's get there [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1132.04s)]
*  Let's go to a turning points event. Let's go to a ufc fight. Let's like talk to some of these kids [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1138.86s)]
*  I watched it and I when I finished I was like, I still didn't hear a logical reason. It just felt like vibes [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1143.8999999999999s)]
*  I think yeah [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1150.54s)]
*  I think it still is vibes [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1152.22s)]
*  The large question was like is there an ideology behind this shift and I think the answer is no [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1154.22s)]
*  I don't think you have a lot of kids who have conservative ideals some there's some religion comes in or whatever those ideals are [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1160.0600000000002s)]
*  But I think mostly they see people finding success [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1166.7s)]
*  On tiktok and the social media space being conservative and that gives them an identity [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1170.38s)]
*  They see it as a little bit punk that gives it an identity [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1174.5400000000002s)]
*  So I think like they're moving towards vibes, which I think for the left [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1177.0200000000002s)]
*  They can get those vibes back, but they're just not engaging with that generation jordan [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1181.26s)]
*  I would have to ask why like why did you want to waste your time and talk to maga younger youngings? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1184.86s)]
*  I don't think it's a waste of time. I think it's I think it's a good exercise [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1190.1399999999999s)]
*  I think more people should do that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1193.1799999999998s)]
*  The reason I say that is because it you're not going to get the answers you like probably and then you're probably going to get [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1194.3799999999999s)]
*  Threatened a lot. Sure. Yes. I mean the first answer health insurance [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1198.62s)]
*  My job is to be able to talk to other people and if I don't do my job [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1202.54s)]
*  I don't have health insurance correct and I have weak bones [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1205.5s)]
*  So we've established that for this six foot nine frame I need that health insurance [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1207.9s)]
*  But I think what I what I like about it. I mean [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1213.5s)]
*  I'm lucky I get to go out there. I'm not a journalist. I'm a comedian. So I get to I get to push [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1217.02s)]
*  Um, I get to ask follow-ups. I get to cavort and try to find something that reveals right like [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1221.66s)]
*  My job out there isn't to convince people of one way or the other [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1227.1000000000001s)]
*  I think my job is to find something that is revealing like for this special [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1230.22s)]
*  We talked to a kid and I always find it fascinating to go to a campus and just see like what what actually is happening cnn [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1233.9s)]
*  We'll tell you one thing but until you go to texas annm and talk to a kid [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1238.94s)]
*  Do you actually understand what it is? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1241.98s)]
*  Like we talked to a kid about like why he was obsessed with charlie kirk and why he was [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1243.5s)]
*  He was going to a charlie kirk event. What is it about this this this guy? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1247.58s)]
*  And he literally articulated like I have a hard time with my words [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1251.34s)]
*  I like to listen to what he says [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1255.18s)]
*  I like to memorize it and then I have his words and his ideas and it's like [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1257.1s)]
*  It's comedic in the the special but I think above that it's it's just revealing like when you're like [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1261.5800000000002s)]
*  Why do these people why are they drawn to this? It's like that kid said it right there [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1266.54s)]
*  He didn't even know that he's he's being somewhat comical that you're just [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1270.14s)]
*  Memorizing ideas so you can regurgitate it, but it's it's very human. He was like he feels lost without that [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1273.96s)]
*  So for me, it's always always compelling to go where the the story is and to talk to folks about it [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1278.94s)]
*  I was gonna ask now the threatening part. Yeah, how many times have you been threatened whether it's calls people in person emails [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1283.9s)]
*  Texts, etc. Etc. I mean that happens a lot the the emails the calls [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1290.6999999999998s)]
*  There's been threats on on family members, which would ain't it's not super fun. I think out in the field [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1296.2199999999998s)]
*  uh [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1302.3s)]
*  10 years ago [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1303.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm not going out there with security guards [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1304.4599999999998s)]
*  You know [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1306.2199999999998s)]
*  You can go out there as a comedian talk about politics and not be afraid of getting punched but trump eric comes in people get more upset [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1306.4599999999998s)]
*  Upset trump says like you're you're a patriot fight back [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1313.6599999999999s)]
*  These are the enemy of the people and it was it was during his first uh first run for president that like we went to [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1316.6999999999998s)]
*  A school board meeting and having a conversation and I get bumrushed by somebody who's just mad that we have a camera there [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1322.3799999999999s)]
*  And since then we keep adding security guards. I was there on january 6th and that got hairy [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1328.78s)]
*  We got a security guard. They got pushed. There's flash bangs going off. They're like we can't stand here [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1334.1399999999999s)]
*  We need to get on a train like it's sort of the new reality and most people I talk to are great [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1338.62s)]
*  They want to talk they are they want to be on tv they want to engage [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1344.0600000000002s)]
*  but [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1347.8200000000002s)]
*  You have it now where people have been weaponized by the most powerful men on the planet [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1348.7s)]
*  And then who says like you can do something you should fight back [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1352.5400000000002s)]
*  These are the bad guys and all it takes is a couple bad ideas for those guys to to feel themselves and um [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1355.1000000000001s)]
*  And and go after you what's the crazy experience you that that you've had so far. I mean j6 was pretty wide [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1360.8600000000001s)]
*  He was out there for j6. I was up there for j6 [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1367.02s)]
*  I was working on j6. All right charlomane. I was working there. I was out there [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1369.1799999999998s)]
*  You know what the funniest moment on j6 [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1379.02s)]
*  Outside of the whole trying to overthrow the government and you know crapping on nancy pelosi's desk outside of that [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1381.02s)]
*  I'm literally interviewing people and we'd been there before and we knew sort of like we don't want to get trapped on the onslaught [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1385.82s)]
*  So let's stay outside of where everybody is [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1393.1s)]
*  And quite frankly we're like where's the one place nobody is uh [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1396.78s)]
*  Congregating and it was outside the african-american history museum. Nobody was going there [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1400.52s)]
*  So we were like we will meet up here and then we will go and find people to interview [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1404.3s)]
*  We start walking we find this guy swinging a pitchfork and I I go up to the man. I start talking to this man [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1408.22s)]
*  Oh, that's the guy you want to talk to that is swinging the pitchfork. We got to make tv here [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1413.74s)]
*  You know that guy's got a pitchfork. He's he's throwing it around lead with blood. All right [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1417.1799999999998s)]
*  I still find hilarious that nobody was outside the african-american [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1421.1799999999998s)]
*  Where are we gonna go? Yeah african-american museum. No, I'm going there. Do you want to engage with america sins of the past? No [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1426.46s)]
*  Let's take a crap on the desk of the capital. What do you say? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1433.4199999999998s)]
*  So we're talking to this guy swinging a pitchfork and he's ranting about revolution [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1437.02s)]
*  And another man comes up he sees the camera and he just starts he's just swearing [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1441.1799999999998s)]
*  He's just obscenity man, and he's yelling so loud that pitchfork man stops the interview [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1445.1s)]
*  He shushes him and then he says this man doesn't speak for me [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1450.86s)]
*  Which then leaves me grateful to the more level-headed man swinging a pitchfork [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1454.46s)]
*  And he he makes eye contact with me and he rolls his eyes as if to say like can you believe this heaven guy? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1458.86s)]
*  I was like, oh, yeah, that's it. Like even this guy is like these guys are too crazy for me [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1464.46s)]
*  Can we just have a conversation and you're like, right? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1467.74s)]
*  We can actually find a little bit of common ground if there is that crazier person there [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1469.8999999999999s)]
*  We got my man jordan clepper from the daily show here. Yo refresh my memory [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1475.42s)]
*  I don't what the hell was happening on january 6 before the insurrection. What was everybody there for? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1478.9399999999998s)]
*  Well, they were there to certify the vote certifiable [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1482.54s)]
*  But trump then preempts it by having a huge rally at 11 o'clock [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1485.1799999999998s)]
*  And so everybody comes out rudy juliani is there and so everybody comes to watch [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1489.4199999999998s)]
*  The the giant trump speech but everybody leaves halfway through not everybody half the folks leave halfway through to start moving towards [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1494.2199999999998s)]
*  The capital which then we saw we saw the proud boys march on the capital. I mean it was a it was a wild day [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1501.4199999999998s)]
*  It was not a surprise though as a a cable comedy show like we knew to be at the capital [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1506.38s)]
*  We were right there when they pushed in because we're like this is where everybody's going [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1512.0600000000002s)]
*  This is where they said they're going there's going to be something happen here [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1515.5800000000002s)]
*  We we didn't expect them to get inside but we knew they'd be there for the sake of content for the sake of clicks [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1518.5400000000002s)]
*  Did you think to yourself? Hey, we should go in with them [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1523.5s)]
*  Luckily like my inherent fear got in the way there [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1527.4s)]
*  I think it was it was confusing as to like what the rules were. I think even at the at the time [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1531.0200000000002s)]
*  There was a small fence that got pushed in and even as you're seeing this and you're watching this and it's again. It's it's half [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1535.9s)]
*  Tragic like this is the capital [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1542.78s)]
*  This is the seat of american governance and I see all these people acting like generals going in there and it's also completely absurd [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1544.46s)]
*  I saw I interviewed literally an old man on a segway trying to go up the hill while it's happening [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1550.14s)]
*  But i'm assuming they can't get in right? You're like they're going to get stopped at some point there [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1555.66s)]
*  But the people just kept coming and and and literally our security guys at one point were just like [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1560.78s)]
*  We're hearing explosions. This is an uncontrolled situation. It's time to get out people at the daily show [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1565.5s)]
*  And you said a little while ago everybody at the daily show always says something that I totally disagree with y'all say that [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1570.6200000000001s)]
*  Y'all not y'all not journalists. Y'all are comedians when the reality is y'all probably some of the best journalists out [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1575.26s)]
*  Because you do things like go and talk to the other side when other folks really don't right? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1581.1000000000001s)]
*  So when do you ever interview people that these rallies well first of all [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1586.5400000000002s)]
*  Do you think it's fair for y'all to be able to say y'all not journalists? Well, it's definitely a dodge [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1589.42s)]
*  So yeah, thanks for calling it out [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1593.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, I mean I think I say that in that the stories we get on the daily show [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1596.3000000000002s)]
*  Are stories that are brought to us by journalists putting in the work and so so that I I respect [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1599.8200000000002s)]
*  And and they work by the code of journalism. I think what we have we take it very seriously [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1604.6200000000001s)]
*  I I don't see myself as a journalist but I take going out and bringing back what we see to the show very seriously [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1609.2600000000002s)]
*  But I I do want an audience to understand the bias that we have towards comedy and that we're making a show with that [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1615.4199999999998s)]
*  Point of view, but I think all news has a bias and I do think like in modern journalism [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1619.8999999999999s)]
*  I don't think it should be a bunch of comedians going out there bringing the stories back far from it [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1624.54s)]
*  But I do think they could probably loosen up some of the rules in the ways in which they engage with people [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1628.22s)]
*  Because and sometimes you see people engaging with the old school rules of journalism not pushing people past their conspiracies or their bs or [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1632.78s)]
*  They're they're weighing both sides. We like no that that's bs [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1640.7s)]
*  You need to call that out [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1643.3400000000001s)]
*  You need to use some other way to knock that person off their talking point so they can reveal something truthful there [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1644.3000000000002s)]
*  I think as comedians we have that ability and at its best it works that way [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1649.5800000000002s)]
*  But we're you we're working in conjunction with with journalists who are actually bringing the story back [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1653.74s)]
*  So that we can have some commentary on comedy is disarming. It is that's the thing that a lot of the journalists [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1658.7s)]
*  Don't have a hundred percent. Yeah, and at its best it cuts to the quick faster [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1663.9s)]
*  Than than trying to argue with somebody else, you know when you do something like the magga the next generation [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1668.14s)]
*  Do you ever leave the rally thinking damn? Maybe i'm the one who doesn't get it. Yeah, I you know [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1673.5s)]
*  I mean, I think I always leave it with a little bit more empathy towards the folks that i'm talking with [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1678.86s)]
*  Because for every you know every five minutes on camera [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1684.22s)]
*  There's two minutes off camera where you're talking about something that's not political and you connect with them and they're interesting [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1686.6200000000001s)]
*  They're compelling you find music that you both care about or something [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1691.74s)]
*  I think like that that softens what you think about the people and the interactions that you have with those people [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1695.02s)]
*  I think I usually feel pretty steadfast in my opinions [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1700.22s)]
*  That being said I do think like no nobody has the certainty that they pretend to have on camera at these rallies [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1704.22s)]
*  like no, there's there's there's a lot of complexity to many many issues, but nobody has the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1710.22s)]
*  The guts are the vulnerability to be open about it usually in front of the camera [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1714.94s)]
*  Now you said you want to bring peace and harmony. God. Did I say that? Yes [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1718.38s)]
*  Really is that true? Oh boy, what did I say? I want to bring peace and harmony [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1722.3s)]
*  So you want to bring peace and harmony? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1725.6599999999999s)]
*  But but uh, how is that when every time a magma member comes you give them a little joke? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1727.4199999999998s)]
*  Give me a little just a little bit [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1731.6599999999999s)]
*  you know what? Yeah, I try to deliver peace through the lovely delivery mechanism of uh, of of a joke I [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1732.78s)]
*  You know, i'd love there to be some peace and harmony, but it is a constant balance of you know [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1739.34s)]
*  I want to empathize. I don't want to just be mean out there when I talk to other people but also it's [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1745.1s)]
*  I think life is pretty serious right now [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1750.06s)]
*  And I think when I go to some of these maga events you see donald trump playing to the masses in a way that [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1752.46s)]
*  Emboldens him to do pretty cruel things and so I don't mind pushing back hard in that direction [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1757.96s)]
*  Uh, but I often think the people I talk to I have sympathy for because I think they're being weaponized by other people who are trying [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1764.54s)]
*  To manipulate them. So that's that's where my empathy tends to lie. Do you ever struggle with where satire ends and responsibility? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1769.82s)]
*  Began yeah, I mean I think like that activist conversation is a tough one [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1776.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't I don't I don't love the hat [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1781.2800000000002s)]
*  I do think like john is somebody who always says like, you know, this is not activism [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1783.1200000000001s)]
*  We're comedians and I think like in some ways that is that that is a safety net [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1787.3600000000001s)]
*  But you also sort of need that to like not approach work every day to think of like [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1791.3600000000001s)]
*  What am I trying to change in the world? Like I understand where that comes from [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1795.5200000000002s)]
*  But it's like the job of the show is to find comedy [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1798.64s)]
*  To follow like your passions the things you care about where you see bs call it out [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1802.4s)]
*  But also like find a way to make it funny and interesting and reformat it [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1806.3200000000002s)]
*  I think that is the job you get you get in tough territory when you're like I need to [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1810.24s)]
*  I need to be an activist in that moment. I don't think that is the place [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1816.24s)]
*  But I think you have to be honest with like your desire to like be a part of that conversation [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1820.0800000000002s)]
*  But also be honest with like what your skill set is and what your platform is [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1824.24s)]
*  Have you ever spoke to somebody where you actually changed their mind by the things that you said and they understood what you were saying? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  No, okay [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1832.5600000000002s)]
*  I do tell the story though. It doesn't happen in front of the camera people don't change their minds in front of the camera, but [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1834.88s)]
*  Off-camera it gets close. I I [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1839.92s)]
*  I was heckled at a rally by a man who was dressed in a brick suit a suit that looked like trump's wall of the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1842.48s)]
*  Spokesuit he had a handlebar mustache. He's known as the brick suit guy trump brings him up on stage and lots of his rallies [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1848.24s)]
*  He's famous there. He trolled me at a rally [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1853.3600000000001s)]
*  He live streamed during our interviews to try to get people not to talk to us. He was paying the ass [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1856.0s)]
*  Uh, we get snowed in and all of us have to fly out the next day after this rally [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1861.44s)]
*  Uh on different flights and I show up at the green bay airport very tiny airport alone [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1866.8s)]
*  There's a three and a half hour delay and brick suit guy is there and I got in the brick suit [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1871.84s)]
*  He's not in the brick suit. He's wearing a maga hat. He's got he's got two extra hats on his uh case [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1876.16s)]
*  But no brick suit civilian clothes and he's like do you want to talk and of course I don't want to talk [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1881.36s)]
*  but we're there at an airport for three and a half hours and we get into it and [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1886.08s)]
*  I don't change his mind. He doesn't change my mind, but [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1891.6s)]
*  He is remarkably open about the things he's unsure about with donald trump [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1894.7199999999998s)]
*  He's unsure. He wishes donald trump didn't go on and on about the 2020 election being stolen [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1898.9599999999998s)]
*  Which is a huge thing to show any kind of weakness like I don't believe trump was honest about that in the maga movement [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1903.36s)]
*  You can't say that for the camera. He says that to me off camera [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1908.64s)]
*  He talks about like where he comes from and frankly he comes he's like a libertarian guy who likes to troll people online [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1911.2s)]
*  You'd like to think that the handlebar mustache guy who dresses in bespoke brick suit is an idiot not an idiot smart guy [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1916.5600000000002s)]
*  Feels like a history buff like the kind of person who has too many like world war two books [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1923.2800000000002s)]
*  But a smart guy has his own uh topics like we literally [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1927.76s)]
*  We laugh somebody recognizes me as we're talking [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1931.92s)]
*  And and ask for a selfie and he takes the photo which is like this he's open to all of this stuff [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1935.68s)]
*  We we talk all the way up until I get on the plane [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1941.12s)]
*  and i'm in an exit row and the woman who takes the ticket I ask if i'm willing to accept the uh, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1944.8s)]
*  The responsibilities of being an exit row. I say yes and then I turned to him and I was like [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1949.92s)]
*  I hope this freaks you out, man [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1953.12s)]
*  And he he laughs and i'm like that's it right there like you're not intimidated by me [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1954.8799999999999s)]
*  You're not i'm not so offended that I made a joke you laugh [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1959.68s)]
*  It's it's humor it's disarming and and it's for most of the people who i'm friends with even who I disagree with you find [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1963.2800000000002s)]
*  Things you can laugh at and and that happens all off camera and i'm not entering that conversation to try to change his mind [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  That's not gonna happen [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1976.48s)]
*  But i'm entering it with like an amount of uncertainty of like here's the things that i'm unsure about what the the left says or [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1977.2800000000002s)]
*  Or here's things that I think are okay about what trump does and he's like here's things that I doubt about what trump does [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1982.64s)]
*  You're like, oh there's there's the human behind that even in the caricature of a guy from the daily show mixed with the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1987.44s)]
*  caricature of a person from the trump universe like they can [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1992.54s)]
*  Talk, they can meet somewhere of an understanding and usually it's it's freaking away from those cameras in a green bay airport [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=1996.32s)]
*  It is memorial day. So we're not here to salute all our veterans out there [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2002.88s)]
*  But we do have some new conversations for you that you haven't heard yet. Uh, my man, Jordan clepper [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2005.76s)]
*  He's got a new special out Jordan clepper fingers the post maga and we're gonna talk to him all about it right here on the breakfast club [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2010.48s)]
*  I remember they had when you had you a late night show. Didn't they have you playing a character of like a [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2016.56s)]
*  Conservative right wing. I was playing like an alex jones style right wing character [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2021.5200000000002s)]
*  And so that that was and at that time too [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2026.24s)]
*  It was like info wars was so huge and big and the conspiracy mindset, which thankfully has gone completely away [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2027.8400000000001s)]
*  We don't see it anymore [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2034.72s)]
*  But that that was me playing a caricature to find humor in in going over the top [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2035.68s)]
*  Quite frankly as comedy has evolved and the politics situation has evolved so much over the last 10 years [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2041.6000000000001s)]
*  Like I think that's still a space to play in there's still humor to be found [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2047.1999999999998s)]
*  But I think audiences are like so tired of [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2051.6s)]
*  Of extreme caricatures you have one in the white house that like I think they're connecting more with comedians [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2055.04s)]
*  On a more authentic level and so that's sort of in some ways where the finger the pulse stuff has come out of trevor [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2060.3199999999997s)]
*  Was big on that. He was just like go out there. You're not you're not playing a parody of a journalist. You're you're yourself [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2065.8399999999997s)]
*  Bringing your wits about you and your opinions find humor in that but don't lean on the character [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2072.16s)]
*  Also, people are dumb so they'll believe you. They're like, uh, I didn't know you were playing the character [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2077.8399999999997s)]
*  You know what i'm saying? Yeah, we had we had at the opposition [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2082.48s)]
*  We had carter page who was a foreign advisor to donald trump and it was [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2086.16s)]
*  the center of the news cycle at one point because people are wondering he was if he was a russian asset because russia [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2091.12s)]
*  Had manipulated him in the past. He was working for the trump administration [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2097.52s)]
*  And he reached out to our show and took a meeting at our show because he wanted to work on our show as someone [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2100.7400000000002s)]
*  He didn't see it as a satire. He saw it as an opportunity which [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2105.78s)]
*  Which was hard for us to swallow. Where do you think satire fits in today's? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2110.42s)]
*  Media landscape when people numb to it are they addicted or are they still reachable? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2115.38s)]
*  Do they understand it? I mean, I think what what has shifted so much is like the the formatting of it all right? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2119.94s)]
*  I think like satire is all about context and that's hard if you're taking in seven second chunks on like tiktok [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2125.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it's easier if you have a 30 minute chunk if you have uh, uh an eight minute, uh rant [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2132.02s)]
*  I think people are drawn to comedy in many ways. It is like the language of [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2137.54s)]
*  Of I mean, it's a language of humor, but I think like it's the quickest way to get to to a truth [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2142.66s)]
*  So I do think I think satire is in in a boom. I think people are are drawn [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2147.3799999999997s)]
*  But I think but that being said the social media landscape has shifted the ways in which we consume all this stuff [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2152.18s)]
*  And that has kind of like it is made for long form [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2157.54s)]
*  Capabilities long podcasts. I think that has shifted where comedy lies and short form as well [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2160.48s)]
*  Which is more about the soundbites now speaking of future of mag. What do you think the future of mag is going to look like? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2165.06s)]
*  Especially in 2028. Oh boy. I think that I I think trump is such a singular [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2169.62s)]
*  Character that they think it can be passed on and that we've seen no proof of that yet [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2176.0s)]
*  Donald trump has been famous his whole life [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2182.34s)]
*  You know, he's you know referencing rap songs when I was coming up in a way that was like he is equated with wealth [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2184.18s)]
*  And I think that is nobody else has that and so I think they're going to try to pass it off [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2188.5s)]
*  Maybe that's to chady vance. Maybe it's to somebody who's even farther right but right now [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2192.82s)]
*  It's still a cult of personality that he's going to try to build around him [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2196.66s)]
*  Uh, we'll see if that baton goes anywhere else [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2200.7400000000002s)]
*  It's interesting when people say that though because to me it's not even about the individual of donald trump [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2203.06s)]
*  There's clearly a whole system that is perfectly okay with him doing everything that he's doing [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2208.98s)]
*  So that is what scares me [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2215.46s)]
*  It's the system that is allowing him to exist because they will allow somebody else to exist in that same way [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2217.54s)]
*  Yeah, they've attached a system and there's people behind it who have gotten [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2224.18s)]
*  Good at understanding how to use donald trump. I think this project 2025 [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2228.02s)]
*  The world of steve bannon's like like okay, we he's going to come in here [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2232.58s)]
*  He's a singular character in his ability to charm half a nation [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2236.74s)]
*  40 some odd percent of a nation. I think that is hard to pass off [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2241.2999999999997s)]
*  But I think you have you have a conservative movement who has sort of lost any [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2245.22s)]
*  Any desire to make a moral argument and just found a way in which to like attach [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2250.1s)]
*  Attach their wants to somebody who will just bulldoze all the way through who is about I mean the trump doctrine is [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2254.58s)]
*  He likes to make deals and he wants whatever is good for him [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2261.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes, and if they can attach conservative things onto the things that are deals and good for him that make him look [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2264.58s)]
*  Successful and popular then they will ride that and he has no problem riding that what's the moment? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2271.52s)]
*  I like a couple more questions. What's a moment that actually made you emotional while doing one of your man on the street? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2276.82s)]
*  I mean [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2283.06s)]
*  it's [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2285.06s)]
*  not to get dark about it all but like we cover news day in and day out and [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2286.58s)]
*  When I was hosting the show specifically like mass shootings [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2291.78s)]
*  Like you're like, oh, how do you find humor in it? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2296.98s)]
*  We find humor [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2298.9s)]
*  but like when you are when it's your responsibility late night has shifted into a place where people come to it to feel like a [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2299.7000000000003s)]
*  connection to what has happened during the days and [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2305.3s)]
*  We have such a mass shooting epidemic in this country and especially when I was [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2308.26s)]
*  Hosting a show. We're like what happened today? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2312.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, the big news is there was another terrible shooting in a school and we had people come on and i've covered like the gun movement [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2314.1800000000003s)]
*  With specials and in the past as well and i've talked to parents and i've talked to students who are affected by all of this [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2320.34s)]
*  and it's such [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2326.02s)]
*  It's such emblematic of what is what is what is wrong with our country? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2327.3s)]
*  Like most people just want safe basic guidelines to try to stop this and there's such inaction on on a federal level [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2330.9s)]
*  That it's constantly infuriating and so as that keeps happening and continues to happen like it's it's [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2337.94s)]
*  It's it's so heartbreaking also as someone who has a kid who's in school right now [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2345.14s)]
*  It's so scary to think of that happening to parents and beyond that it's so infuriating because it's like the system is broken [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2349.14s)]
*  When you have people who who scream out from the rafters? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2354.74s)]
*  80 some odd percent of people are like we just need basic stuff to try to help kids in schools [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2357.8599999999997s)]
*  And yet you have like a system of government that can't respond to that like that always it always pisses me off [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2362.18s)]
*  Hmm, what's your dream field piece that you haven't gotten to do yet? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2367.94s)]

*  According to charging documents the victim called 911 when state police arrived [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2502.18s)]
*  They found him walking along the shoulder of 95 with seven gunshot wounds to the arm and torso [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2506.98s)]
*  Court documents show he told police he was on his way into work and got a flat tire [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2514.34s)]
*  So he pulled over on the shoulder of 95 just north of the howard county line [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2519.14s)]
*  When he got out to inspect the tire his co-worker kevin gross pulled up behind him and got out wearing a mask covering his mouth [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2523.62s)]
*  Quote gross told him he must have hit a pothole or something [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2531.2200000000003s)]

*  Gross then produced a firearm and began firing numerous shots end quote [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2538.82s)]
*  Charging documents reveal the two were assistant managers at planet aid in elkridge [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2543.54s)]

*  Kevin you got the right last name because this was gross [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2555.06s)]

*  You going to prison. Okay. Now let's do the prison math. All right [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2633.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm making 50 60 grand a year in baltimore as a 46 year old man [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2636.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know about y'all [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2640.4199999999996s)]
*  But if I can afford to put some food on my table and have a roof over my head, i'm gonna be happy [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2641.3799999999997s)]
*  Okay, success is subjective and if you're a free man [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2645.9399999999996s)]
*  46 years old you can come and go as you please you got a job you maintaining that's a good life [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2649.54s)]
*  If you don't think it's a good life go to a prison right now and talk to these brothers doing 15 [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2654.66s)]
*  Doing 20 doing 25 some of them doing forever and ask them would they trade lives with the free man making 50 to 60 grand [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2659.54s)]
*  As an assistant manager at planet aid hell, even if he got demoted [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2666.82s)]
*  Okay, even if he got demoted the warehouse lead role at planet aid earns about 27 39 per hour [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2670.74s)]
*  According to chat gpt. That's almost 57 grand a year if you work in 40 hours a week [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2677.7s)]
*  All i'm saying is no matter how much I calculate [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2682.34s)]
*  This prison math, okay. I've done addition subtraction multiplication division. I tried to figure this out multiple ways and guess what? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2685.94s)]
*  It just don't compute [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2693.46s)]
*  Okay, it just doesn't add up. The victim is in critical condition [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2695.14s)]
*  He got seven times. He got shot seven times. Kevin gross is charged with attempted first-degree murder in maryland. That's life in prison [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2698.82s)]
*  First and second degree assault kevin gross is also charged with first degree assault is 25 years in maryland [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2706.3399999999997s)]
*  Second degree assault is 10 years in maryland and he got other related charges [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2712.1s)]
*  Moral of the story is kevin is spending the rest of his natural born life in prison [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2716.58s)]
*  Therefore the prison math ain't adding up. It's just not worth it [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2721.94s)]
*  You have to calculate it in your head. You got demoted [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2725.94s)]
*  You don't even know if this person you shot had anything to do with it [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2728.74s)]
*  But even if they did as soon as you started formulating this plan in your head, just think about it [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2731.54s)]
*  I'm gonna cut his tires. I'm gonna shoot him a bunch of times at some point your brain has to say no [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2736.98s)]
*  No, no, no, no [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2742.34s)]
*  This prison math ain't mathin. This is not a situation that's worth having to eat jail food for the rest of your life [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2743.86s)]
*  Or having an inmate treat your bunkie like a bowl of cereal [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2750.7400000000002s)]
*  So please let remi ma give kevin gross the biggest hee haw [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2754.9s)]
*  You stupid mother fucker, are you dumb you got demoted take the l [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2761.54s)]
*  How do you get demoted from like a salvation army place? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2766.26s)]
*  That's a goodwill place. And what could you do wrong? Yeah, I don't know [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2770.1s)]
*  But he didn't even ask no questions. He just assumed it was just the other this other person and shot him seven times [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2775.14s)]
*  Now he's gonna spend the rest of his life in prison [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2780.66s)]
*  for that [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2783.06s)]
*  No add up, they don't need to play and you also [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2784.82s)]
*  I mean we can if you want to what you want to play a game? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2788.1000000000004s)]

*  Always do prison math though whenever you about to make a choice that you think gonna get you in some type of trouble [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2812.7400000000002s)]
*  Especially if it's involving any type of crime. It's just just calculate it in your head. Is this worth the time you're gonna get? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2818.1800000000003s)]

*  So I wasn't able to smuggle [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2972.7400000000002s)]
*  My mascot into the building. Oh, that's right. Yeah, a chicken is my cultural totem like the animal that represents my culture is a rooster [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2975.22s)]
*  And it's because arusa is a timekeeper arusa is a caregiver arusa is [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2983.06s)]

*  Okay, I know you didn't I didn't know the animal laws in New York [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=2998.66s)]
*  I had to drive all the way to Pennsylvania like [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3002.34s)]
*  Yeah to get the queens [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3004.98s)]
*  They wouldn't sell it to me in queens. Nobody would give me a live chicken in New York because it's against the law [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3006.98s)]
*  So I had to go all the way to Pennsylvania across state lines to look for the chicken [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3012.9s)]
*  But yeah, I think it's about the wording because you know in america [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3017.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if y'all say this in kenyan america didn't say so you have to say I want to bring my [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3020.02s)]

*  Like lease of life. So now i'm a solo artist. I've been a solo artist for two years now [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3062.42s)]
*  And everything's looking up. I'm at the breakfast club mama. I made it [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3067.1400000000003s)]
*  Nice why does sauti soul take such a long hiatus for music y'all y'all last? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3070.58s)]
*  Um the last thing I made in 2005. Yeah, we're like new addition from kenya. Yeah, all the boys too man [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3075.54s)]

*  What made you just want to go solo now? Yeah, just trying something new, you know after doing something for a long time [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3086.42s)]
*  I think it was time for us to try and see what the other side looks like and it's been beautiful so far [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3091.06s)]
*  I think we needed this break so that our next season will be just as glorious even better [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3096.1800000000003s)]
*  And what is the other saudi soulers doing? Like what they're making music. They're doing interesting things [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3101.62s)]
*  My brother polycap just launched his guitar jawaya, which is an amazing guitar chimano is on tour [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3106.5s)]
*  Savada is putting out music as well. So we're all busy and we're all working together [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3111.3s)]
*  Like we're all writing for one another we're all producing for one another. We're still friends. Oh great friends. Great friends amazing [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3115.38s)]
*  Why do you think um, east african music hasn't seen a surge and I guess mainstream the way artists from the western [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3121.14s)]
*  south [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3128.5s)]
*  Well, there's many aspects to it including the fact that it's just never been funded any music that you hear [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3129.86s)]
*  Uh in the west is marketing dollar spent to get that music there [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3135.38s)]
*  So for a long time east africa hasn't had that limelight [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3139.14s)]
*  Also, our numbers in the diaspora don't come anywhere close to nigeria [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3142.02s)]
*  So the dominant culture in the diaspora is going to be nigeria but the next logical sound to listen to after you've gone [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3145.78s)]
*  North east west and northern north west and south is east and so here we are, you know, we're taking the stairs [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3152.9s)]
*  But we're getting here anyway [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3159.7s)]
*  No, why is it? I noticed with with international artists. They always want to win in the u.s [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3161.62s)]
*  Why is that so important because when you win in the u.s, the reward is too high [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3167.46s)]
*  Being the biggest artist in kenya is nowhere close being the biggest artist in the u.s [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3172.58s)]
*  When you win in the u.s, you win in the world [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3176.18s)]
*  So for a long time this market has dominated the world like that. Also you guys have the structures you have the venues [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3178.4199999999996s)]
*  The ticket masters and all these, you know, all of these infrastructure that makes music what it is in the world [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3185.14s)]
*  Yeah, so you're the thought leaders your global leaders. Why not? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3189.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, remember when uh, your your love for music first hit you. Yes [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3193.06s)]
*  I was like maybe five or six [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3198.1s)]
*  I was watching bob marley's song [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3200.3399999999997s)]
*  And that's the first time I was like, whoa, what is this like I feel like doing this thing [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3205.86s)]
*  And i've been doing it since i'm 37 now guys. I've been singing 31 years [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3210.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, wow since six years old since I was six [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3214.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I joined the choir and church and I always say the church is the best artist development program in the world [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3217.62s)]
*  Because that's where all the great musicians especially for black music come from [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3224.3399999999997s)]
*  How was it in Kenya because you know, you know you hear stories people from nigeria their parents like no [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3228.34s)]
*  You're not gonna go into music. You're not going to go on entertainment [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3232.34s)]
*  You're gonna be a doctor, you know like like in kenya when you said you wanted to do music [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3234.5s)]
*  How was it? My mom said as long as you finish school as long as you finish college [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3237.78s)]
*  You can do whatever you want and music has been a kind master to me music paid me through college [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3241.54s)]
*  Like I put in my first single with sautissier with my band when I was a freshman and just like that my life changed [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3247.46s)]
*  I had to finish school [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3253.46s)]
*  But I started to be a journalist so i'll probably be working here [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3255.14s)]
*  I did communications and did you know that moment where you knew you were gonna make it like oh this is [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3259.7799999999997s)]
*  This is what I was here to do [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3264.42s)]
*  I told also my cousin when I was six that i'm going to be a superstar [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3266.5s)]
*  And she laughed it off [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3270.42s)]
*  But I remind her to this day that this is written like I always knew that this is what i'm gonna do [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3271.7s)]
*  yeah, even though sometimes life pushed me in directions where [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3276.74s)]
*  I wasn't in my direct journey. Like for example, like when I studied communications [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3279.94s)]
*  It wasn't me studying music, but it came back now to make sense, you know, like [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3284.6s)]
*  My auditory skills are different. I understand how to interview how to there's just things I learned in uni that are very vital for me right now [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3289.6400000000003s)]
*  And you and back then you was just like i'm i'm think i'm training to be [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3296.44s)]
*  On the other side of the microphone, but then you end up being an artist so you got it [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3300.28s)]
*  I was actually just finishing school to clock out something in life [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3303.6400000000003s)]
*  Say that I have a degree but I wasn't very passionate about it. What'd you major in? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3306.84s)]
*  communications [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3311.38s)]
*  Okay, you just said that yes, he communicated that day he just [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3313.0s)]
*  Not as effective. I just wanted to be clear [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3317.16s)]
*  It is memorial day [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3320.2000000000003s)]
*  So we're not here but we do have some conversations that you haven't heard [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3321.48s)]
*  You know, we all are fans of afro beats and you know all the sounds that are coming out of the continent right now [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3324.6s)]
*  So I want to introduce you to somebody you may or you may not know his name is bn [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3330.12s)]
*  Okay bn is an artist from kenya [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3335.32s)]
*  An afro pop musician and we're going to talk to him because he's currently on tour here in the states [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3337.32s)]
*  And we're going to talk to him right now. I saw something where they were saying you uh, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3342.36s)]
*  The grammys was donating some money to kenya. That was political. So the grammys are doing an africa grammys [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3346.52s)]
*  You know like same way you have the latin grammys. So there's been talk about africa doing [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3353.6400000000003s)]
*  A grammys and kenya had put in a bid to be the host for the grammys [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3358.6800000000003s)]
*  3.8 million was something like that. Yeah, and the bid the whole I think the news came out at a very bad time [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3363.1600000000003s)]
*  Because at that time economically and even now we're not doing so well as a country [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3371.1600000000003s)]
*  So a 3.8 million dollar spent on the grammys feels like an impulse spent [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3376.5200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's like come on that the grammys would bring in would be quadruple that i'm sure [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3383.48s)]
*  You know not a lot of people have the insights of the music business to understand [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3388.1200000000003s)]
*  The value of the grammys coming to kenya like that, you know [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3392.2s)]
*  But so the people were just up in arms because they felt like there's many more ways to spend the 3.5 million dollars [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3395.08s)]
*  Yeah, why did you agree with it? I was an artist and I understand what it's going to do for my constituency for my people [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3401.56s)]
*  Like this is future future, you know investments for the artists who are coming, you know [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3407.3199999999997s)]
*  They're going to thank us one day for hosting the grammys in kenya [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3412.44s)]
*  So I think it's not a bad thing. Maybe the communication behind it should have been better [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3415.16s)]
*  Maybe they should have been told about the financial degree in communications [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3419.08s)]
*  Yes, I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. Maybe just the communication only should have been better [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3423.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3428.36s)]
*  They should have said what nvr said about the profit and what we stand to gain as a country [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3429.32s)]
*  And this and this and this and many people would have been like, okay, we see it. I mean it would the visitation [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3434.12s)]
*  Yeah hotels restaurants foods tourism. Yeah [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3438.36s)]
*  I mean, it's just so much that you get the development programs for the different facets of the music industry that the grammys comes with [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3441.8s)]
*  Yeah, you know the grammy is like a good artist development program as well second to church [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3447.6400000000003s)]
*  So yeah, it would be nice if they came through. Yeah, i'm still hoping they do [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3452.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, does that put a lot of pressure on you knowing that kenya is a country that isn't doing that well financially? [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3455.88s)]
*  But you may be doing better than most [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3461.08s)]
*  Yes, it puts pressure on me [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3463.48s)]
*  To make art that speaks to those people [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3465.7200000000003s)]
*  And tells their story to the world [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3468.76s)]
*  Like I want people to see the pain and the struggle in my art [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3471.32s)]
*  I want them to listen to the lyrics and I want them to I want the lyrics to take them to places in kenya [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3475.24s)]
*  That they've never been to and I want the human experience to connect [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3479.56s)]
*  So right now we're not going to a very easy time. Our government has no opposition [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3483.08s)]
*  The opposition is the youth and for the last year or so there have been so many abductions [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3487.96s)]
*  Uh, there's been so many there's been freedom [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3493.3199999999997s)]
*  Of expression but not freedom after expression [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3496.36s)]
*  And I just think it's important for us to know that or the leaders to know that I have more faith [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3499.64s)]
*  In the children who are coming than their leadership in terms of the power they used to oppress [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3505.24s)]
*  I don't have any fear to the current like uh regime. I have more faith in the kids and I think the kids are [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3511.16s)]
*  Going to save us. Do you feel comfortable living there? I feel comfortable living in kenya. Yeah, I would say to a large extent [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3517.64s)]
*  Uh, kenya is a beautiful country [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3524.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's many experiences you can get and if and and we're generally very peaceful people [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3526.28s)]
*  But the recent times have been very tough economically, but we are not a basket case. That's right [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3532.28s)]
*  Yeah, we are proper people kenyans are fighters [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3537.32s)]
*  Africans are fighters and the people of africa will keep the lights on the people of kenya will keep the lights on [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3540.6600000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah, what is one of your favorite songs from the album? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3545.0s)]
*  Mashari [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3548.0400000000004s)]
*  Mashari. Yeah, it's a tribute to you. Just I wrote it to you. Yeah, she's married [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3549.2400000000002s)]

*  There's such complex issues that I can't really address right now in the brass bass club, but i'm not doing it [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3571.56s)]

*  I know you are happily married. I'm just saying yeah based off [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3587.72s)]
*  African tradition in a lot of countries. Yeah, you are allowed to have another wife constitutionally in kenya [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3591.7999999999997s)]
*  You're allowed do I want another wife? No, I don't yeah, not now. I know I don't [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3597.48s)]
*  Because just because you're in trouble just because that's you know, culturally like y'all can do that [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3603.32s)]
*  Doesn't mean you always want that right there. Yeah, I so I come from a polygamous family. My dad has [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3609.64s)]
*  10 kids from six different women legend. I am the last of 10 [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3616.2799999999997s)]
*  I am the last [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3620.6s)]
*  You mean you've been troubled. I know you by the way, he's married. Yeah, was he married to him or just um [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3622.6s)]
*  Informally you one would argue that yeah, so formally he's been married to two [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3628.42s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, my mother is the last of the 10 and i'm yeah [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3632.2799999999997s)]
*  Of the six they all know about each other they all know about each other when he bought a spoon for our house [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3636.04s)]
*  He bought a spoon for the other house [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3639.96s)]
*  You know like yeah [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3642.52s)]
*  If you guys really understand how polygamy works, maybe it's not going to be a very touchy subject [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3644.04s)]
*  I think just when you listen from the west and how people speak about it. It's just really [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3649.0800000000004s)]
*  Given the vibe that it's unfair [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3654.44s)]
*  But it's everything it has everything to do with society and how society was set up back then it may not work now [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3656.92s)]
*  I agree, but back then it had everything to do with community [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3662.6s)]
*  And looking out for one another you know in some cases a guy was polygamous because maybe his first wife couldn't get kids [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3666.52s)]
*  You see and she'd be like, let me bring a helper to see how we can do this [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3672.7599999999998s)]
*  Also, the more kids you had the more labor you had [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3677.16s)]
*  Because we were farmers [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuFbISC8l2Q&t=3680.84s)]
