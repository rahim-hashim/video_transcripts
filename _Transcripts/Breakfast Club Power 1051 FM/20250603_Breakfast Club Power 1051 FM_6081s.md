*  Oh nice. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=179.22s)]
*  Different agencies and this and the other. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=180.06s)]
*  Are they checking on me? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=181.62s)]
*  No, they were saying that that was positive. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=182.46s)]
*  The fact that we let that young man, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=184.22s)]
*  or I don't know how old he is, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=185.66s)]
*  let that brother come up here and rap, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=186.66s)]
*  and let him know, talk to you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  Talk to me, did they see the striptease? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=190.66000000000003s)]
*  Did they see the dance? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=193.9s)]
*  And nobody cares about you, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=195.78s)]
*  Yeah, they weren't calling a check on me, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=196.94s)]
*  or apologized to me. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=198.5s)]
*  They called to say all the positivity. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=199.94s)]
*  By the way, Big Chris wasn't up here [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=202.22s)]
*  because he got Down Syndrome. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  Big Chris was up here because he's entertaining. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=205.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=206.82s)]
*  And Big Chris be with Ricky Smiley, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=207.66s)]
*  and if you ever heard Ricky Smiley and Big Chris together, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=208.82s)]
*  Big Chris is just an entertaining person. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=211.06s)]
*  Correct. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=212.62s)]
*  You can't just come up here because you got Down Syndrome. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=213.9s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=215.66s)]
*  You got to be kidding me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=216.5s)]
*  But that's true. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=217.34s)]
*  That ain't gonna get you in the door by itself. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=219.18s)]
*  Something else gotta be happening. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=221.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=222.5s)]
*  But all the blogs and all the places [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  that represent a lot of kids that have Down Syndrome, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=225.78s)]
*  we're very excited the fact that we had Big Chris up here, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=228.02s)]
*  we let him express himself, we let him rap, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=230.26s)]
*  and we let him talk, and they were just so excited about it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=232.34s)]
*  I enjoyed Big Chris. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  I always enjoyed Big Chris. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=235.5s)]
*  I was happy to even see him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=237.06s)]
*  That's why Ricky brought him up here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=238.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  Because last time Ricky was here, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=240.14s)]
*  we was talking about Big Chris. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=240.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=241.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=242.66s)]

*  We love to hear that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=271.46000000000004s)]
*  First off, front page, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=272.78000000000003s)]
*  more updates on this attack out of Boulder, Colorado. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=273.70000000000005s)]
*  Now the FBI says Mohammed Sabri Salman [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  planned the attack in Boulder on Sunday. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=279.14000000000004s)]
*  For over a year, in court documents, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=281.98s)]
*  Salman said he researched on YouTube [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  how to make Molotov cocktails. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=286.78s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=288.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he's a husband and a father of five [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  and he allegedly planned [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=291.82s)]
*  or said that he had planned the attack for one year [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=293.26s)]
*  but waited until his daughter graduated to carry it out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  Now documents claim he also said [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=298.73999999999995s)]
*  he wanted to kill all Zionist people [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=300.82s)]
*  and wished they were all dead. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  Now meanwhile, the White House is pointing out [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=304.09999999999997s)]
*  the immigration status of the suspect. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt noted [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=308.26s)]
*  that the Egyptian man overstayed his tourist visa [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=309.82s)]
*  and the Trump administration is taking a look, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=312.65999999999997s)]
*  a hard look at these types of attacks [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=314.72s)]
*  saying they should never happen. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=317.52s)]
*  Let's take a listen to White House Press Secretary [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=319.04s)]
*  Caroline Levitt. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Any individual, especially illegal criminals [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=322.8s)]
*  who engage in acts of terrorism [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=325.68s)]
*  will be held accountable under this president. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=327.68s)]
*  This terrorist came into our country [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=329.88s)]
*  under the previous administration, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=332.04s)]
*  Joe Biden's administration, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=333.6s)]
*  foolishly gave him a tourist visa [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  and that allowed him to unlawfully remain in our country. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=337.76s)]
*  She went on to say this person [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=342.6s)]
*  should have been deported a long time ago [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=343.84s)]
*  and of course, President Trump said the attack [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=345.76s)]
*  will not be tolerated in the United States of America [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=347.41999999999996s)]
*  and he added that the suspect came in through Biden's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=350.44s)]
*  quote, ridiculous open border policy [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  and he quote, must go out under Trump policy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=356.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, meanwhile, Colorado Governor Jared Polis, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=361.4s)]
*  he spoke yesterday in Denver saying [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=365.2s)]
*  there doesn't appear to be an extended conspiracy [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=367.12s)]
*  involving the Boulder fire attack suspect [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=370.41999999999996s)]
*  and he's confident the suspect will have his day in court. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Colorado Governor Jared Polis [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  and his comments. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=379.36s)]
*  At this point, we have no reason or information [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=381.12s)]
*  that there was any type of extended conspiracy [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=383.56s)]
*  although that investigation continues. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=385.76s)]
*  I'm confident he'll be prosecuted [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  to the full extent of the law. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=389.56s)]
*  Of course, the suspect Mohammed Sabri Salman, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=391.94s)]
*  as mentioned before, is accused of using [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  in Sunday's attack, which seriously injured eight people. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=400.64s)]
*  He's already been charged with a federal hate crime [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  and the 45, as mentioned before, as well, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=406.52s)]
*  the 45 year old, a Jim Shaman, was in the US illegally. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=409.12s)]
*  Let me ask you guys a question. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=413.08s)]
*  When it comes to a lot of this, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  I know this is a small part of the problem, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=414.97999999999996s)]
*  but the fact that people can actually [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  Google some of these things, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=418.8s)]
*  like Google how to make a cocktail, whatever you call it, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=420.0s)]
*  or Google how to make a ghost gun, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=422.64s)]
*  or Google how to make a bomb, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=424.4s)]
*  certainly be cutting some of these things off online [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=426.36s)]
*  where people just can't get access to it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=428.96s)]
*  It's true, and then to your point, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=431.32s)]
*  as you were saying in previous days [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=433.8s)]
*  about how they're going to, moving forward, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  some students will be vetted on social media. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=439.56s)]
*  I'm sure that could be a thing as well. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=441.64000000000004s)]
*  It's like, what have you been looking up? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=443.56s)]
*  What have you been Googling? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=444.92s)]
*  What have you been researching? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=446.0s)]

*  that vetting process, but yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=450.36s)]
*  People who wanna kill you, people who wanna harm you, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=452.72s)]
*  they're gonna find a way. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=454.8s)]
*  And this is a sad, sad situation. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=455.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't know how to combat this level of bigotry. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=458.56s)]
*  I don't know how to combat this level of prejudice. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=461.6s)]
*  If I did as a black person, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=463.68s)]
*  I would've made it stop a long time ago. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=465.0s)]
*  Just make it a little more difficult, though. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=466.52s)]
*  The fact that you can Google how to make a bomb, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=467.96s)]
*  and it'll give you step-by-step. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=470.08s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm talking about the bigotry, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=471.44s)]
*  and the prejudice, and the racism, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=472.8s)]
*  and the anti-Semitism that fuels people [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=474.28s)]
*  to do these type of things. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=476.28s)]
*  I don't know how to make that stop. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=477.32s)]
*  Like I said, if I was, as a black person, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=478.56s)]
*  I would've made this stop a long time ago for us. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=481.24s)]
*  And this is just who some people in this world are. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=484.12s)]
*  Sad. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=486.64s)]
*  This is very sad. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=487.76s)]
*  Very sad, very deep-rooted. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  But I will keep you guys posted [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=491.0s)]
*  as to what happens with that story. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=493.08000000000004s)]

*  so-called big, beautiful bill. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=500.48s)]
*  And we're still on the topic, for whatever reason, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=502.04s)]
*  of Joe Biden's mental health decline. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=504.76s)]

*  You know why we're still on that topic? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=508.0s)]
*  Because we're on that topic [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=509.6s)]
*  because the Trump administration is here [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=510.84000000000003s)]
*  because of that mental decline. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=512.44s)]
*  And I also wanna say, this is why, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  whenever you see bigotry or you see prejudice [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=515.5999999999999s)]
*  or you see racism or antisemitism of any kind, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=518.04s)]

*  Because Martin Luther King Jr. said, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=522.64s)]

*  I'm from North Carolina. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=921.36s)]
*  Now, first thing, number one, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=923.12s)]
*  Ethiopia was the only country in Africa [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=925.32s)]
*  that wasn't colonized. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=928.92s)]
*  Russia helped them. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=930.48s)]
*  How? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=931.96s)]
*  Because, if a woman elect the second of Ethiopia [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=932.88s)]
*  in the 1800s, she saw how Japan had kept their country [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=937.52s)]
*  updated so that they could keep up [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=941.32s)]
*  with the Western countries. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=943.92s)]
*  As if a woman elect the second, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=945.6s)]
*  one of the same for Ethiopia. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=947.84s)]
*  It was Russia that sent people to help them solve [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=950.1999999999999s)]
*  with their educational system and their healthcare system. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=953.4s)]
*  And they sent some generals also [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=956.52s)]
*  for their military strategy. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=958.6s)]
*  And it's because of that that they were able to defeat [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=960.4s)]
*  the Roman invaders or the Pope [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=963.28s)]
*  during around the Berlin conference. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=967.04s)]
*  Russia also helped the slaves gain their freedom. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=970.56s)]

*  push your tea clips conversation. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1144.1999999999998s)]
*  So, push your tea and his brother, Malice, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1145.6s)]
*  sat down with GQ and they had a conversation [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1147.6799999999998s)]
*  about everything, where music is now [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1150.36s)]
*  and the fact that they have their first album coming out. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1151.8400000000001s)]
*  It's been 15 years. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1155.52s)]
*  But one of the biggest questions that a lot of people had [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1157.2s)]
*  is why has it taken so long? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1159.52s)]
*  And according to Push Your Tea, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1162.04s)]
*  he says that Def Jam tried to censor [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1164.3600000000001s)]
*  Kendrick Lamar's verse on a song that they have on the album. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1168.04s)]
*  And eventually it turned into a back and forth of [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1172.04s)]
*  censor it, take the song off, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1175.28s)]
*  and then from there it went to them [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1177.16s)]
*  eventually dropping clips and Push Your Tea solo [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1178.92s)]
*  and then them moving on. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1182.0s)]
*  Well, it hasn't been 15 years because of that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1183.3200000000002s)]
*  It was 15 years because the one brother gave up rap [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1185.0s)]
*  at one time and wanted to do Christian rap. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1188.0400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1190.0s)]
*  And now they got back together doing rap. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1190.8400000000001s)]
*  But I mean, they dropped the press release over the summer [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1191.68s)]
*  and over the summer when they dropped the press release [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1195.0s)]
*  and remember they teased the song at the LB Fashion Show? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1196.6000000000001s)]
*  People thought that it was gonna be like [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1199.3200000000002s)]
*  a lot sooner than right now than today. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1201.2800000000002s)]
*  So, that's what I'm referring to. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1203.5600000000002s)]
*  So what happened was when that press release dropped, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1205.6000000000001s)]
*  a lot of people realized that there was no mention [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1207.48s)]
*  of Def Jam, which was a thing because clips, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1209.8s)]
*  their whole deal with Def Jam was new. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1212.92s)]
*  It happened over like the last year or so. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1214.84s)]
*  So people were like, what is going on? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1216.96s)]
*  Instead, they actually attributed the distribution [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1219.04s)]
*  and the marketing to Jay-Z's rock nation. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1222.44s)]
*  So in the GQ article, Push Your Tea talks about, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1224.92s)]
*  they were really excited. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1228.4s)]
*  They went to Def Jam, they were proud, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1229.52s)]
*  they thought that, you know what I mean? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1231.84s)]
*  Like everything was moving, how it was supposed to move. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1232.84s)]
*  And then Def Jam heard the song Chains and Whips, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1235.16s)]
*  which is the song that Kendrick Lamar is on. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1238.3200000000002s)]
*  And they weren't going for it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1240.24s)]
*  Specifically, there was an attorney with Def Jam [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1243.72s)]
*  and they are claiming that this attorney is the person [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1247.76s)]
*  who said, okay, we have to censor the song. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1250.64s)]
*  And then it was the person who said, well, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1252.68s)]
*  what if we just remove the song altogether? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1254.6000000000001s)]
*  And then came back and said, okay, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1256.8000000000002s)]
*  let's move away from the clips, let's drop the clips. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1258.24s)]
*  So Push Your Tea is like, well, the issue is- [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1261.0400000000002s)]
*  That was dumb. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1262.92s)]
*  Well, you know why they censor it. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1263.76s)]
*  I'm sure Def Jam wanted to censor Kendrick [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1265.0s)]
*  because they're in the middle of this lawsuit with Drake. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1267.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1268.8s)]
*  I guarantee you that something to do with that lawsuit. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1269.64s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1270.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1271.52s)]
*  So according to Push Your Tea, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1272.34s)]
*  the lawyer's name was Steve Gauley. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1274.1200000000001s)]
*  And he says that what he believes is their issue was that, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1275.84s)]
*  you know, you got two of Drake's biggest, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1278.84s)]
*  like arch enemies, right? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1281.88s)]
*  Who were on this song and UMG is in the middle of, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1283.8s)]
*  or Def Jam, they're in the middle of this lawsuit. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1287.28s)]
*  So they're like, no, we can't, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1288.72s)]
*  like we don't want any more fire. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1290.48s)]
*  Let's just sit back. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1291.76s)]
*  And Push Your Tea is like, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1292.66s)]
*  well, basically that has nothing to do with us. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1293.5s)]
*  So yeah, so they're like, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1295.64s)]
*  well, we'll just drop the clips and then Push Your Tea. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1296.56s)]
*  It's like, well, the issue is I'm still here [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1298.72s)]
*  as a solo artist. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1300.56s)]
*  So if you're going to let clips go, let me go as well too. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1301.96s)]
*  And it got to the point where that's what they did. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1305.76s)]
*  So. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1307.44s)]
*  Def Jam should be ashamed of themselves. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1308.28s)]
*  Okay. Record label censoring artists. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1309.48s)]
*  What happened to my freedom of speech? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1311.2s)]
*  Russell Simmons would never. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1313.36s)]
*  That'd be it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1314.6399999999999s)]
*  Jay-Z would never when he was president. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1315.48s)]
*  Leo Cohen would never when he was president. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1317.08s)]
*  Kevin Lyles would never. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1319.6799999999998s)]
*  Like he said, that's freedom of speech. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1320.6799999999998s)]
*  Allow him to say what he wants to say. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1322.76s)]
*  That's the stuff. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  That's it all. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1325.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1326.56s)]
*  I mean, I agree, but. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1327.4s)]
*  And by the way, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1329.48s)]
*  albums like the clips are the type of albums Def Jam [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1330.32s)]
*  should be putting out. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1332.32s)]
*  I call that adult contemporary hip hop. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1333.16s)]
*  Like artists that you know are just timeless and classic. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1335.72s)]
*  Def Jam is supposed to represent a timeless classic label. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1339.68s)]
*  That's the type of project they should be a hundred percent [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1342.64s)]
*  behind. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1344.84s)]
*  Well, that was the origin of Def Jam, the streets, right? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1345.68s)]
*  When you see artists like, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1347.2s)]
*  we can go back from Jay-Z to GZ to the clips. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1348.28s)]
*  Like that's the origin of Def Jam. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1353.72s)]
*  That's what built Def Jam. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1356.24s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1357.0800000000002s)]
*  That's why this is really, really weird. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1357.92s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1359.6000000000001s)]
*  And I also think too, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1361.0s)]
*  I think it's certain artists that you can kind of [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1362.68s)]
*  play around with like this. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1364.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't think that it was smart for them to even approach [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1365.88s)]
*  them directly, indirectly, whatever, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1369.8600000000001s)]
*  with something like this, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1371.3600000000001s)]
*  as if they're going to care and they're going to be quiet [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1372.2s)]
*  about it. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1374.3200000000002s)]
*  It's just bad press for a label that doesn't need it. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1375.16s)]
*  Not right now. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1378.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's just bad press for no reason. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1379.16s)]
*  Not right now at all. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1381.0s)]
*  Well, I do, I grabbed one of the photos and for the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1381.8400000000001s)]
*  listeners, please go take a look at the GQ interview [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1384.24s)]
*  because they look so good in their photo shoot. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1386.36s)]
*  They're all black. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1389.04s)]
*  They have a ton of different photos and in the interview, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1390.36s)]
*  they're actually in a Sprinter with the writer of the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1392.4s)]
*  article, trying to just find food. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1395.2s)]
*  And they're just having a conversation about music and [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1396.6s)]
*  where music is now. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1398.36s)]
*  And they've aged very well, not just as artists, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1399.44s)]
*  but as humans. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1402.92s)]
*  Like, you know, when you get to a certain age, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1403.76s)]
*  that's what you look at. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1405.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't care about your designer. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1405.96s)]
*  I don't care about your cause, your jury. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1406.8s)]
*  What do you look like? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1408.32s)]
*  Is your skin clear? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1409.16s)]
*  Eyes white? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1410.32s)]
*  Are you mentally and physically in shape? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1411.16s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1412.64s)]
*  I agree. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1414.14s)]
*  And they've always been like that. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1414.98s)]
*  They've always been on their workout regimen. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1415.82s)]
*  They've always been on their eating good food regimen [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1417.38s)]
*  and they're all about family. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1419.66s)]
*  So that's the main purpose of the clips. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1420.74s)]
*  Salute to the clips. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1422.54s)]
*  I also appreciated Malice's perspective when he was [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1423.38s)]
*  talking about how you don't have to address everything [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1425.8600000000001s)]
*  and how artists feel the need to talk back to their fans. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1429.3400000000001s)]
*  And he was like, you know, you talk about, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1432.22s)]
*  you can see people's egos taken over and folks never [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1433.58s)]
*  learn to sit down. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1436.54s)]
*  And he said, you can rise above that eternally if you are [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1437.46s)]
*  at peace with yourself. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1440.02s)]
*  They plan out, they plan out. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1440.9s)]
*  If you don't know them and you know, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1442.1399999999999s)]
*  hopefully they'll come up here. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1443.98s)]
*  They plan out everything. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1445.1s)]
*  They plan out the next five years of where they want to be [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1446.3799999999999s)]
*  with fashion and music and their investments. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1448.58s)]
*  They plan out everything. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1451.1799999999998s)]
*  They are very methodical when they come to the way [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1452.1399999999999s)]
*  that they think about things. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1455.5s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1456.34s)]
*  And one of the other things too, well, first of all, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1457.54s)]
*  I thought that that was a good take for Malice [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1459.4199999999998s)]
*  cause he's the type, he just sits back. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1460.78s)]
*  He doesn't really get involved in anything whatsoever. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1462.1799999999998s)]
*  But even in this article, he's talking a lot more about, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1464.8999999999999s)]
*  he talks about like, he feels like he's watched the engine [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1467.4599999999998s)]
*  leave rap where like he left and he took a step away. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1471.26s)]
*  He came back and things are exactly where they are. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1474.34s)]
*  But they also talk about whether this new collaboration [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1476.18s)]
*  with rock nation means we're going to get more [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1478.66s)]
*  Pusha T, Jay-Z music. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1480.18s)]

*  thinking he can't do this anymore. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1691.58s)]
*  He was always on top of his brief. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1693.1s)]
*  I saw president Biden not very long ago [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1695.6599999999999s)]
*  and I thought he was in good shape. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1698.1399999999999s)]
*  So what are your thoughts there? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1699.4599999999998s)]
*  Clinton was actually on the show promoting his new book, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1701.06s)]
*  The First Gentleman. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1704.06s)]
*  I think Bill Clinton is holding the party line. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1705.82s)]
*  And we don't need anybody that's continuing [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1708.1799999999998s)]
*  to hold the party line to the detriment of the country. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1710.9399999999998s)]
*  Because that's what happened with President Biden. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1714.1799999999998s)]
*  People held the party line so much [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1715.54s)]
*  to the detriment of the country. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1718.06s)]
*  Because if President Trump was the threat [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1719.3799999999999s)]
*  that everybody said he was going to be, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1721.9399999999998s)]
*  then they should have governed like a threat [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1724.02s)]
*  and they should have been doing things [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1725.86s)]
*  to ensure that threat doesn't get back into power. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1728.26s)]
*  And running Joe Biden, keeping him in that position, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1730.54s)]
*  definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1733.78s)]
*  didn't ensure that Trump wasn't gonna get back [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1736.7s)]
*  in that position of power. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1738.62s)]
*  But the sad thing about it is we said it, right? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1739.46s)]
*  We seen it and we got ish for people saying [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1741.3799999999999s)]
*  that that's not true, this, that and the other, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1743.74s)]
*  that's not happening. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1745.78s)]
*  But we all seen it with our eyes. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1746.74s)]
*  We ain't never met him. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1748.46s)]
*  I ain't never met the man. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1749.82s)]
*  So you mean to tell me that those of us [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1750.86s)]
*  who never met the man saw it, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1752.46s)]
*  but people that used to see him on the regular [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1753.8999999999999s)]
*  didn't see it? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1755.82s)]
*  Cut it out. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1756.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it's just a matter of what you saw [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1757.5s)]
*  and where you might've saw it. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1759.34s)]
*  Because I was around and very heavily involved [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1760.58s)]
*  with the Biden administration [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1763.1799999999998s)]
*  and covering the Biden administration. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1764.34s)]
*  I had been around him during the time [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1765.86s)]
*  where people were saying he was on his mental decline. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1767.9399999999998s)]
*  And I will say from a personal perspective [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1771.1s)]
*  that he was just old. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1774.1399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't giving that he wasn't sharp. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1775.34s)]
*  He just was old and slow moving. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1777.26s)]
*  That was just my, and that was just. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1779.1s)]
*  Hey Morgan, you know the contradiction [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1781.06s)]
*  that Bill Clinton said in that interview, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1784.1799999999998s)]
*  because I watched that whole interview this weekend. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1785.5s)]
*  He said that, he said that, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1787.4199999999998s)]
*  but then he turned around and said, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1788.98s)]
*  but you know, I did question if he could do that job [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1790.86s)]
*  until he was 86. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1793.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1794.46s)]
*  He was saying that anybody could do the job [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1795.3s)]
*  until they were 86, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1796.6599999999999s)]
*  because Biden was the oldest person to do it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1797.58s)]
*  I mean, that's just anybody. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1799.4199999999998s)]
*  But he's the person, he's the guy. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1801.06s)]
*  And you can't just say anybody. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1803.02s)]
*  He was the guy that was closer to 86. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1804.26s)]
*  And nobody was attacking him. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1806.02s)]
*  I think if you had a family member that had dementia [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1807.1399999999999s)]
*  and like, you seen signs from that Joe Biden had [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1810.06s)]
*  that I seen Gia's mom had, right? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1814.1399999999999s)]
*  I see no same type of signs. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1815.98s)]
*  So that's worried me. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1817.34s)]
*  And if you voted me somebody, you have questions. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1818.58s)]
*  And the fact that I feel like they were lying, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1820.86s)]
*  you know, concerns me a lot. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1823.62s)]
*  Of course, the concern for sure was legitimate, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1825.02s)]
*  but you know, whether or not, you know, what was going on. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1827.54s)]
*  But I'm, where I'm standing right now is trying to figure [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1829.74s)]
*  out why is it still the topic of conversation, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1832.3799999999999s)]
*  but you're saying it is because we are [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1834.94s)]
*  where we are right now. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1836.82s)]
*  So I think it's a topic of conversation [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1837.78s)]
*  because you shouldn't learn from history. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1839.8600000000001s)]
*  And you know, they just put out the book, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1840.9s)]
*  the original sin, but based off Bill Clinton's logic, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1842.26s)]
*  if that's the case, then we should never discuss [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1845.06s)]
*  what any president does after they are no longer president. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1847.14s)]
*  We shouldn't discuss Barack Obama's legacy. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1849.9s)]
*  We shouldn't discuss Clinton's legacy. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1852.42s)]
*  We shouldn't discuss George Bush legacy. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1854.06s)]
*  Based off what Clinton is saying, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1856.02s)]
*  once a person is out of office, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1857.5800000000002s)]
*  we shouldn't be talking about them no more. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1858.82s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1860.5s)]
*  This is when Democrats sound ridiculous to us. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1861.42s)]
*  This is when politicians sound ridiculous to us. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1864.3s)]
*  Cause they're so busy trying to hold the party line [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1867.06s)]
*  that they sound foolish. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1869.06s)]
*  Tell them how you really feel. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1870.74s)]
*  All right. Well, moving on another news, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1871.82s)]
*  house minority leader, also a Democrat, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1873.3s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries is among lawmakers raising alarms [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1875.4199999999998s)]
*  over president Trump's so-called [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1878.02s)]
*  one big beautiful bill act. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1879.34s)]
*  Now Jeffries was in attendance at a rally [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1881.94s)]
*  in Brooklyn on Sunday, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1883.7s)]
*  alongside New York governor Kathy Hochul [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1885.26s)]
*  to detail concerns about what will happen [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1887.1s)]
*  if the U S Senate passes the act. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1889.7s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1891.54s)]
*  You know, the GOP tax scam is not one big beautiful bill. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1893.86s)]
*  It's one big ugly bill that will hurt everyday Americans, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1898.02s)]
*  hurt everyday New Yorkers. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1901.94s)]
*  And it's designed to reward their billionaire donors [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1904.3799999999999s)]
*  like Elon Musk. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1907.22s)]
*  So Jeffries also warned and others warned [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1908.86s)]
*  that it would impact federal funding to Medicaid [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1912.1399999999999s)]
*  causing many of those to lose health insurance. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1914.1399999999999s)]
*  Now Trump has said that cuts are targeting waste [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1916.34s)]
*  and fraud and abuse. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1919.18s)]
*  And the U S Senate is expected to take up the bill this week. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1920.78s)]
*  They are officially back in session today. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1923.74s)]
*  Now New York governor Kathy Hochul [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1926.3s)]
*  also heavily criticized the Trump administration [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1928.1399999999999s)]
*  and Republican lawmakers over a number of issues. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1929.62s)]
*  She says the Republican led plan to make steep cuts [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1932.34s)]
*  to Medicaid is taking from the poor [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1935.46s)]
*  and giving to the rich and a reversed, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1937.22s)]
*  what's the, I'm sorry, a reverse, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1940.46s)]
*  what is it, not Peter Pan, who does, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1942.6999999999998s)]
*  who takes from the rich and gives to the poor? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1944.1399999999999s)]
*  Robin Hood. Robin Hood. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1945.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1947.3s)]
*  And a reverse Robin Hood type of situation. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1948.1399999999999s)]
*  She says she can't promise that all of her hospitals [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1950.06s)]
*  will stay open in New York. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1952.1s)]
*  So this is gonna impact New Yorkers [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1953.58s)]
*  if this bill to cut Medicaid becomes law. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1955.14s)]
*  Let's take a listen to New York governor Kathy Hochul. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1957.94s)]
*  This is a level of attack that is unforeseeable [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1960.3400000000001s)]
*  but it has to be stopped. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1965.3400000000001s)]
*  What they're proposing is basically reverse Robin Hood. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1966.5400000000002s)]
*  They're taking from the poor to give to the rich [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1971.3400000000001s)]
*  and people need to rebel against that. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1975.18s)]
*  If we lose $3 billion for hospitals, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1977.46s)]
*  I can't say we're going to be able to keep [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1980.42s)]
*  all of my hospitals open. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1982.38s)]
*  I cannot say that right now. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1983.82s)]
*  They have to back off. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1985.6599999999999s)]
*  So Hochul also went on to say that it's hard [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1987.1399999999999s)]
*  to protect people from disease if COVID vaccines [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1989.06s)]
*  are no longer being recommended for healthy children [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1991.4199999999998s)]
*  and pregnant women, as just stated by health secretary, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1993.54s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1996.78s)]
*  And she also says she'll stand up for immigrant rights [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=1998.02s)]
*  when testifying at a house oversight committee [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2000.3799999999999s)]
*  in about a week. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2002.8999999999999s)]
*  So as I mentioned, that big, beautiful bill [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2004.3s)]
*  is now being taken up in the Senate. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2006.4199999999998s)]
*  After the Senate vote, house lawmakers will have a chance [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2009.1399999999999s)]
*  to approve changes to the bill. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2011.78s)]
*  And like I said before, Congress is officially back [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2013.6200000000001s)]
*  in session today. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2015.98s)]
*  So I will keep you posted as to what happens with that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2016.86s)]
*  I had one more story. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2020.46s)]
*  I'm not gonna get too much into it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2021.42s)]
*  I'll just say that updates and improvements [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2022.54s)]
*  at Newark, New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2026.58s)]
*  are underway and it does appear that things are moving [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2030.02s)]
*  in a positive direction per transportation secretary, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2033.7s)]
*  Sean Duffy, who was there this earlier this week. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2037.3s)]
*  So it looks like one of the runways has been, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2040.74s)]
*  that was shut down for maintenance, has reopened. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2043.6200000000001s)]
*  So it looks like things are moving in a positive direction [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2045.5800000000002s)]
*  for Newark Liberty Airport. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2048.18s)]

*  Thanks for having me, y'all. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2090.46s)]
*  How you feeling this morning? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2091.94s)]
*  Nice being in the room. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2092.7799999999997s)]
*  Goodness. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2093.98s)]
*  Man, nice having you. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2094.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, you're one of those people, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2095.66s)]
*  people always say, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2096.8599999999997s)]
*  who would you ever want to interview? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2097.7s)]
*  And you'd really be like, I don't know, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2099.18s)]
*  because you can't really think of nobody. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2101.7s)]
*  But then when you see you on the schedule, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2102.7s)]
*  you're like, oh, shit, Candace Parker. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2104.3799999999997s)]
*  I'd love to have a conversation with Candace Parker. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2106.2599999999998s)]
*  I appreciate you. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2108.3399999999997s)]
*  I really enjoyed your book, The Can Do Mindset, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2109.22s)]
*  How to Cultivate Resilience, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2112.1s)]
*  Follow Your Heart, and Fight for Your Passions. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2113.18s)]
*  Can you break down why you called it The Can Do Mindset? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2115.02s)]
*  Yeah, growing up, nickname Can, short for Candace, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2118.14s)]
*  you know that. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2121.1s)]
*  But my mom, I grew up with two older brothers, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2121.94s)]
*  eight and 11 years older than me. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2123.8599999999997s)]
*  And fast forward, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2125.22s)]
*  my oldest brother played 10 years professionally, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2127.18s)]
*  played alongside LeBron for years. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2129.2599999999998s)]
*  My middle brother became a doctor. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2131.66s)]
*  And so I just saw these enormous role models [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2133.22s)]
*  that were doing so many great things. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2136.18s)]
*  And I think sometimes I doubted myself. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2137.8199999999997s)]
*  And so my mom, from the time I was little, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2140.18s)]
*  two, three years old, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2141.8599999999997s)]
*  she'd always see the doubt in my eye [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2143.02s)]
*  and she'd always be like, can do. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2144.66s)]
*  And it just became my mantra [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2146.02s)]
*  and it became my voice in my head. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2148.2999999999997s)]
*  And I mean, it took me through high school, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2150.3799999999997s)]
*  knocking down game winning free throws [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2152.4599999999996s)]
*  to shoot, even now. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2154.2599999999998s)]
*  And so then it became an acronym for community, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2156.22s)]
*  authenticity, navigating negativity, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2159.4599999999996s)]
*  loving the dash, which is the journey in between, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2162.22s)]
*  and seizing and creating opportunity. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2164.54s)]
*  Well, congratulations on August 25th, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2166.8999999999996s)]
*  your jersey will be retired, well deserved. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2168.4599999999996s)]
*  How does that feel? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2170.4599999999996s)]
*  To go back home to Chicago, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2171.2999999999997s)]
*  I grew up in Naperville, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2173.3399999999997s)]
*  and I grew up a Chicago Bulls fan. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2175.02s)]
*  I mean, they won six championships in the 90s [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2176.8199999999997s)]
*  when I was living there. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2180.22s)]
*  And so it became synonymous with winning. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2181.2599999999998s)]
*  So to go back and play basketball [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2183.22s)]
*  in front of the people that first saw me pick up a ball [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2184.8999999999996s)]
*  and then to win a championship [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2187.4599999999996s)]
*  in front of the people that first saw me play basketball, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2189.5s)]
*  I don't think, I mean, that was super special. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2192.62s)]
*  I couldn't have written it any better. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2194.98s)]
*  And I think first, you dream of a championship [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2196.4199999999996s)]
*  being up in the rafters, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2199.2799999999997s)]
*  and second, you dream of your jersey as well. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2200.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it was in the authenticity section of the book [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2202.8599999999997s)]
*  you were talking about being competitive, right? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2204.74s)]
*  And how people don't let women be competitive [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2207.2999999999997s)]
*  the way that the men are. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2210.9399999999996s)]
*  When you see, and I know you get this all the time, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2212.34s)]
*  when you see the Caitlyn Angel rivalry [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2213.9s)]
*  or whatever you wanna call it, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2216.0200000000004s)]
*  isn't that just women being competitive? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2216.86s)]
*  I think it's women being competitive, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2218.38s)]
*  but honestly, I think that the more visibility you get, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2220.0600000000004s)]
*  the more scrutiny you're gonna get. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2223.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's just nature. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2225.34s)]
*  As women, I think society always tries to put you in a box. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2227.3s)]
*  So as athletes, we fit outside that box. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2230.5800000000004s)]
*  You're either too muscular, you're not competitive enough, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2233.46s)]
*  but then when you show competitive nature, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2236.2200000000003s)]
*  it's not ladylike. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2238.38s)]
*  So whatever you do, as a woman, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2240.0s)]
*  I feel like until we break that mold in society [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2242.76s)]
*  where it's okay for us to be fierce competitors, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2246.72s)]
*  I think you're always gonna have a different narrative. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2250.04s)]
*  And so, yeah, I look at it like it's competitive [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2253.32s)]
*  and it's two people going at it, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2256.48s)]
*  and sometimes I think it's overblown. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2258.88s)]
*  Sometimes I think that you're making a basketball play [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2263.04s)]
*  and then there's 15 angles from different cameras [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2265.6s)]
*  that try to make it something it's not. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2268.0s)]
*  So I don't know, I'm just excited [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2270.64s)]
*  where women's sports is in general right now [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2272.84s)]
*  because people are talking about it, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2275.72s)]
*  people know the names, people are following the brands, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2277.04s)]
*  and a lot of it has to do with the visibility of it. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2279.44s)]
*  Women's sports has always been there. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2282.18s)]
*  It's just a matter of people tuning in [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2283.56s)]
*  and paying attention, and I think organizations, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2285.96s)]
*  broadcasters, all that, giving it a chance to succeed, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2289.04s)]
*  not putting it head to head up against NFL, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2291.98s)]
*  not putting it head to head up against finals [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2294.32s)]
*  or MLB or whatever, and so I think now [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2297.16s)]
*  we're seeing more women's basketball, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2299.64s)]
*  and because of that, I think that's why it's grown. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2301.08s)]
*  The reason I ask, I watch a lot of women's basketball [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2303.68s)]
*  and I've been watching angels since college, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2306.44s)]
*  so since even that Caitlin incident, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2307.72s)]
*  I've seen her and Aaliyah Thomas have a little kerfuffle. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2309.9s)]
*  She's always getting into it with somebody, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2312.08s)]
*  but it's not the same reaction from people. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2314.32s)]
*  It's just, to me, it's just like women out there [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2316.96s)]
*  playing ball, they're being competitive. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2318.92s)]
*  And I think ball players know that, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2320.44s)]
*  but now you're getting the casual fans [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2321.96s)]
*  that don't understand that type of basketball. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2323.44s)]
*  So I think it's a competitive nature. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2326.28s)]
*  Now, are there things that cross the line? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2328.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes, are there comments and discussions [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2330.3s)]
*  behind things that cross the line? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2333.84s)]
*  100%, and I think we have to get that under control, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2335.2000000000003s)]
*  but to me, I think half the time [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2338.28s)]
*  it's more competitive than anything. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2340.88s)]
*  But there's rivalry as well. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2342.52s)]
*  I remember Reggie Miller with the choke sign, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2343.8s)]
*  we still want action with him regardless. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2346.6000000000004s)]
*  There's still things that's gonna make the press [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2348.2000000000003s)]
*  push it a little more. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2350.34s)]
*  You said we hit Nick Tran. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2351.1800000000003s)]
*  By the way, I'm sorry, man. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2353.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry about what happened. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2354.44s)]
*  It's okay though. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2356.56s)]
*  Can I see you say maybe next year? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2357.4s)]
*  Listen, I'm a Bulls fan, so you know where we're at. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2358.8s)]
*  Oh, y'all been about it. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2360.64s)]
*  Y'all better can't cool. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2361.48s)]
*  But listen, what is the saying if you're not first or last? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2362.32s)]
*  So technically, we weren't even in the playoffs, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2364.44s)]
*  so it was okay. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2367.68s)]
*  And I wanted to ask, you dominated the WNBA broadcaster, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2368.52s)]
*  mom, author, which was the most difficult journey? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2372.36s)]
*  Motherhood is a journey that is the greatest gift, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2375.72s)]
*  gives you the most rewarding feeling, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2379.82s)]
*  but it's also the hardest job that you can have. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2381.98s)]
*  You think you have it figured out [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2385.4s)]
*  and then you have another kid, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2386.6s)]
*  or you think you have it figured out [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2387.6s)]
*  and there's another stage of life. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2388.76s)]
*  I have a 16-year-old daughter, a three-year-old son, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2390.56s)]
*  and a one-year-old son. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2392.96s)]
*  And they are all different, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2394.94s)]
*  and they have all taught me so many different lessons. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2396.84s)]
*  And I'm just super grateful for not only what I'm able [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2399.52s)]
*  to bring to the table and what I teach them, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2402.62s)]
*  but the lessons they've taught me. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2405.6s)]
*  They have humbled me so many times. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2407.6800000000003s)]
*  They have checked me so many times. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2409.88s)]
*  They have made me look myself in the mirror [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2411.5s)]
*  and ask myself, am I doing what I'm asking them to do? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2414.6s)]
*  And so I think motherhood is one of those things [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2417.64s)]
*  where I'm just so grateful for it. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2420.4s)]
*  I'm so grateful for my daughter [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2423.16s)]
*  and us being able to kind of go through my career [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2425.24s)]
*  and grow up together and fumble and bump [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2428.4s)]
*  and live across the water and all of those things. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2430.5s)]
*  And then I'm super grateful to be able to now [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2433.68s)]
*  take a moment with my sons [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2435.6s)]
*  and be able to have a different type of perspective [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2436.96s)]
*  in motherhood and parenthood. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2439.2599999999998s)]
*  What part of your personality do you think [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2440.7599999999998s)]
*  was misunderstood the most during your playing career? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2442.66s)]
*  And this book helped you to, I guess, reclaim that. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2445.2599999999998s)]
*  What's so crazy to me is I think when you're going through [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2447.98s)]
*  just trying to figure stuff out, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2451.1s)]
*  you're just trying to figure out. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2452.86s)]
*  That's what you're trying to do, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2454.5s)]
*  but you're going through life trying to mask it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2455.72s)]
*  And for so many parts of my life, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2458.4s)]
*  during some of my greatest triumphs, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2460.2599999999998s)]
*  winning championships, winning MVPs, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2462.94s)]
*  I was going through struggles behind the scenes [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2465.58s)]
*  within motherhood and balancing that, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2468.9s)]
*  within relationships, within trying to figure out [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2470.84s)]
*  how to be authentic in who I am. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2474.04s)]
*  And I think the person that I became in that process [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2476.48s)]
*  and who I was for my teammates wasn't always great. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2479.1600000000003s)]
*  It wasn't always who I was. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2481.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I think through writing this book, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2483.0s)]
*  it has helped me better understand who I wanna be, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2485.0s)]
*  who I commit to be, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2488.08s)]
*  but also giving myself grace through those moments. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2490.02s)]
*  Because I think sometimes we show up [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2493.0s)]
*  and we feel like we have to be this at work, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2494.36s)]
*  but we're still not ourselves. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2496.8s)]
*  And the people around us know that. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2498.7000000000003s)]
*  And then they start treating us [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2500.32s)]
*  like those people that we aren't. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2501.6400000000003s)]
*  And then it just snowballs out of control. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2503.7400000000002s)]
*  So I think who I am, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2505.52s)]
*  people may have had a different idea. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2507.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2511.1600000000003s)]
*  And I wasn't always proud of the way [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2512.0s)]
*  that I treated my teammates [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2513.82s)]
*  or how I showed up to work every day. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2515.0800000000004s)]
*  But sometimes when you're just trying to show up [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2517.36s)]
*  and you're trying to make it, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2519.2000000000003s)]
*  that's the best that you can do. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2520.8s)]
*  So I think I kinda went through that [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2522.02s)]
*  and processed that in writing this book. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2523.96s)]
*  What was the most difficult thing [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2525.76s)]
*  you had to write in the book? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2526.84s)]
*  The one difficult thing was like, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2527.84s)]
*  you thought about maybe I should take out. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2529.6s)]
*  Or you cried, or it was that hard. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2531.2799999999997s)]
*  It's really difficult to tell stories [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2533.44s)]
*  that need to be told [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2536.2799999999997s)]
*  that aren't going to paint certain people [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2537.64s)]
*  in a positive light. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2539.92s)]
*  And I think I struggle with that [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2541.68s)]
*  because I like to take the blame. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2542.92s)]
*  I like to take the onus on myself [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2544.68s)]
*  in games and losses and missed shots and whatever. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2546.52s)]
*  I like to say that I've always had a part [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2549.12s)]
*  in whatever happens. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2551.2s)]
*  And so writing this, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2552.2799999999997s)]
*  it's trying to figure out how do you tell these stories [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2553.68s)]
*  and how do you tell it [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2557.24s)]
*  where it's your story to tell. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2558.12s)]
*  Whereas you're not telling somebody else's story [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2560.48s)]
*  because I was very conscious of that. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2562.3199999999997s)]
*  So just kinda talking about my parents' divorce [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2563.74s)]
*  and talking about leaving the LA Sparks [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2566.7599999999998s)]
*  and deciding to go to Chicago, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2570.2799999999997s)]
*  talking about my wife. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2572.44s)]
*  And then also near and dear to my heart, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2574.08s)]
*  like Coach Summit. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2576.6s)]
*  My coach in college passed away in 2016 [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2577.8399999999997s)]
*  and kind of navigating that [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2581.3199999999997s)]
*  and what to share, what's intimate [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2582.68s)]
*  that I need to keep to myself [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2584.72s)]
*  and what can I share [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2586.88s)]
*  and would I have her blessing in sharing. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2587.92s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Candice Parker, Charlemagne. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2591.08s)]
*  Has your greatness ever made you feel isolated? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2593.92s)]
*  Like people only saw Candice Parker the player [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2596.1600000000003s)]
*  but not Candice Parker the person? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2598.2400000000002s)]
*  You know what's so crazy? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2599.7200000000003s)]
*  In basketball, there's like a finite time. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2601.08s)]
*  The ball is gonna eventually stop bouncing. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2603.52s)]
*  Father time, I mean, LeBron has kind of proven [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2606.56s)]
*  that's not the case, but for most of us. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2608.2000000000003s)]
*  But it's like your identity becomes the game. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2610.6800000000003s)]
*  You keep the main thing, the main thing. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2613.48s)]
*  That's been my gift my whole life. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2615.2799999999997s)]
*  Basketball has been the main thing. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2617.2799999999997s)]
*  I gave up prom, like left prom to go to basketball, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2619.52s)]
*  lived abroad to play basketball. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2622.64s)]
*  But it's like when you retire, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2624.4399999999996s)]
*  your identity of the who and the what is separated. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2627.0s)]
*  And you realize like the people that really saw you [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2629.7999999999997s)]
*  for who you are versus what you did. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2632.8399999999997s)]
*  And so I think that was the biggest struggle for me [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2634.8399999999997s)]
*  is like everybody has that morning, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2637.56s)]
*  that death after you retire. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2639.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I love basketball. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2641.52s)]
*  It was my first love. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2642.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I think, yeah, like separating my identity from that. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2644.48s)]
*  And I was very conscious of trying to show people [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2648.52s)]
*  like I am a history buff. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2651.12s)]
*  I love to travel. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2652.36s)]
*  I'm a foodie. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2653.2400000000002s)]
*  I love wine, tequila, connoisseur, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2654.08s)]
*  like all of those things. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2655.96s)]
*  I'm so much more than just basketball. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2657.44s)]
*  And so having that separation, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2659.76s)]
*  I know it's like huge for athletes. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2661.8s)]
*  It is a struggle, like talking to people that have retired [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2664.72s)]
*  and have gone and walked that path [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2667.68s)]
*  because it is a death a little bit. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2669.68s)]
*  Jealousy. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2671.76s)]
*  My family, honestly, my wife, I'll say my brother as well. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2673.24s)]
*  My oldest brother went through this [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2678.0s)]
*  and he seamlessly transitioned. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2679.3199999999997s)]
*  I planned the transition ahead of time. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2681.3199999999997s)]
*  I started commentating, gosh, way back in 2015, 2016. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2683.6s)]
*  I started transitioning. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2689.36s)]
*  I started doing more business and paying attention [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2690.52s)]
*  and wanting to be at the table [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2693.04s)]
*  and in meetings and things like that. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2694.48s)]
*  So the transition occurred before it officially, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2696.16s)]
*  the ball officially stopped bouncing. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2699.24s)]
*  But boy, there were days where I'd wake up [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2701.32s)]
*  and it's just like, you miss that feeling of walking in [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2703.8s)]
*  and 18,000 people are screaming your name [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2706.0800000000004s)]
*  and the feeling of your family's identity is that. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2708.36s)]
*  They plan their summers around when my games were, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2712.7200000000003s)]
*  or trips or, you know. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2715.44s)]
*  You've been doing it since a kid though. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2717.2400000000002s)]
*  You've been doing it since, and it's crazy [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2718.0800000000004s)]
*  because you realize, although I don't like attention, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2719.88s)]
*  that's not what I play basketball for, it's an event. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2723.36s)]
*  You go play, everybody watches you play. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2726.48s)]
*  It is the attention your parents give you. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2728.6800000000003s)]
*  It is, and then afterwards, everybody's like, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2730.36s)]
*  where are we going to eat? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2732.28s)]
*  You go eat. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2733.2400000000002s)]
*  Then it's like, you know, and it's like, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2734.1200000000003s)]
*  you don't realize how much of that is a part of your life. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2735.6400000000003s)]
*  And so for me, I think that was the hardest thing. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2738.44s)]
*  But like I said, I had my family. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2742.2400000000002s)]
*  We had my son last year and he just was like, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2744.48s)]
*  he had the ability to make me stop and realize [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2747.1200000000003s)]
*  that's where I was supposed to be. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2749.52s)]
*  I've always been 15 million different places. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2750.8s)]
*  And so I think, honestly, my son Hart [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2753.08s)]
*  made me really appreciate retirement [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2756.2000000000003s)]
*  because I got to enjoy all the little things. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2758.84s)]
*  Jealous is not the right word, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2761.2400000000002s)]
*  but do you ever get jealous or feel away [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2762.6800000000003s)]
*  when you look at the way WNBA players are treated now [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2765.2000000000003s)]
*  than when you guys played? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2769.2000000000003s)]
*  I just remember like two, three years ago, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2770.1200000000003s)]
*  and I was on a plane flying from Atlanta [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2772.04s)]
*  and there were some players from their Atlanta team. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2773.84s)]
*  They were on the back of the plane [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2776.36s)]
*  and they couldn't get first-class seats [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2778.0s)]
*  and they were riding and they were struggling. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2779.6400000000003s)]
*  And they even said, talk about this on the radio. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2781.1600000000003s)]
*  And now when you see them, they're starting to fly private [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2784.5600000000004s)]
*  and they're starting to make a little more money. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2787.04s)]
*  They're starting to make endorsements. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2788.44s)]
*  Do you ever feel away like, damn? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2789.4s)]
*  You got to feel a little bit of that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2790.76s)]
*  I don't want them to have to go through [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2793.8s)]
*  what we went through, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2795.36s)]
*  but I also know that Cheryl Miller, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2796.84s)]
*  who never got to step foot in the WNBA, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2798.8s)]
*  didn't want me to not have a lead to play in. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2801.56s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2804.4s)]
*  And so I think like, yes, sometimes would it have made, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2805.28s)]
*  would I have scored more points [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2808.84s)]
*  if we had a private flight waiting for, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2809.88s)]
*  would I have made more school performances [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2811.4s)]
*  if I could get back the night of the game [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2815.76s)]
*  and been able to sleep and rest and recover? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2817.52s)]
*  Would I probably had a lot fewer injuries? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2819.28s)]
*  100%. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2821.76s)]
*  But I feel like I'm proud because I know [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2822.88s)]
*  my name will be mentioned in the conversation [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2826.0s)]
*  of those that made it possible today. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2829.48s)]
*  Like made the things possible today. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2831.52s)]
*  I remember flying commercial in premium plus [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2833.04s)]
*  in a middle seat next to Sylvia Fowles [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2837.48s)]
*  going to play them in the game five of the WNBA finals. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2840.1200000000003s)]
*  We like wrestled over the armrest. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2843.7200000000003s)]
*  I won, but like they won the game, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2845.84s)]
*  but I won the armrest battle. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2849.1600000000003s)]
*  And I remember thinking like, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2850.6000000000004s)]
*  this isn't how it's supposed to be. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2851.5600000000004s)]
*  But now on the other side, I want ownership. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2854.2000000000003s)]
*  Like I want to own a team. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2857.7200000000003s)]
*  Like I want to be a part of that [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2859.36s)]
*  in making it better as well. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2860.6800000000003s)]
*  So I can't count another woman's pocket. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2862.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't want to, I've done one myself [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2865.1200000000003s)]
*  and the ability to take care of my family [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2867.1600000000003s)]
*  and have all the opportunities I have today [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2869.32s)]
*  because of the Cheryl Millers and the Nancy Liebermans [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2871.76s)]
*  and Shemeco Hostgals and all those that came before me. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2874.76s)]
*  Do you think the world has truly reckoned [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2878.2000000000003s)]
*  with how different your career would be [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2880.2400000000002s)]
*  if you were a man with the exact same time? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2882.5600000000004s)]
*  I talk about it a lot. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2884.7200000000003s)]
*  McDonald's All-American 2004, Dwight Howard and myself, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2885.96s)]
*  we were the number one players. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2889.4s)]
*  I was woman's, he was men's. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2891.48s)]
*  And I actually, there's a blurb in the book [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2893.1200000000003s)]
*  where him and I went to prom when I was in high school [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2895.0800000000004s)]
*  and our trajectories were so different after that day. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2898.1600000000003s)]
*  And I was angry. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2901.2400000000002s)]
*  I remember being angry because like inside my house, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2902.44s)]
*  I was like, I'm gonna go to prom with my mom and dad. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2905.44s)]
*  You can do and be anything. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2907.68s)]
*  And at that point you couldn't have NIL money. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2908.92s)]
*  So I'm watching my quotes be on shirts sold. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2910.72s)]
*  I'm watching everybody in Knoxville wearing my jersey [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2913.7999999999997s)]
*  and I'm eating Papa John's before games [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2917.0s)]
*  because the school can't even pay for my meal [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2920.2799999999997s)]
*  because it was illegal at the time. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2922.72s)]
*  And so in the book I talk about, [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2924.4s)]
*  I was really upset because yes, he's 6'10", big, strong, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2926.24s)]
*  but he had this league laid out that was already growing, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2930.24s)]
*  and I was going through the growing pains [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2933.68s)]
*  of what I was about to go through. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2934.96s)]
*  And then I just was like, my left hand is better than his. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2936.3999999999996s)]
*  And so I was mad because I was like, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2938.7999999999997s)]
*  he has this league to go develop [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2941.3599999999997s)]
*  and use his name and image and likeness. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2943.68s)]
*  And I have to wait four years, go abroad [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2946.08s)]
*  and compete in a league that was geez, 20 years young. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2948.16s)]
*  Wow, wow. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2952.9199999999996s)]
*  Another part of the book I love, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2954.7599999999998s)]
*  it was interesting to read about how you came to grow [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2956.3199999999997s)]
*  to love your wife, right? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2959.24s)]
*  And it had me thinking, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2960.96s)]
*  because you did it like that. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2964.16s)]
*  It had me thinking, what else about yourself [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2965.7200000000003s)]
*  did you realize, this just isn't me? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2968.6s)]
*  What's so interesting is I think [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2971.7200000000003s)]
*  I've spent my entire life standing out [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2973.96s)]
*  and somehow in that process, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2976.4s)]
*  sometimes I did things just to stand out [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2978.6s)]
*  and not really listen to myself and who I wanted to be. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2981.32s)]
*  And that's kind of opposite of what I've always [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2984.96s)]
*  tried to live by. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2987.8s)]
*  And for a long time, it took my daughter really being like, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2988.96s)]
*  are you happy? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2993.44s)]
*  For me to really look myself in the mirror [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2995.0s)]
*  and say, am I just going through the motions? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2996.76s)]
*  I always grew up envisioning myself [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=2998.76s)]
*  with a Prince Charming, always. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3001.04s)]
*  I never, in a million years, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3003.2s)]
*  when I do those little trashy magazine things, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3005.76s)]
*  I would always talk about Prince Charming. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3008.2s)]
*  And it's crazy because sometimes life hands you things [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3010.88s)]
*  and packages that you least anticipate it coming in. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3013.64s)]
*  And that's what happened with my wife. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3017.96s)]
*  I mean, she's my best friend [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3019.2000000000003s)]
*  and she's been there through the ups and downs. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3020.92s)]
*  And I think it was about her and I both being like, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3022.88s)]
*  wait a minute, are we allowing other people's judgments [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3026.28s)]
*  to dictate the next 30 or 40 years? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3029.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna allow my Instagram followers [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3032.04s)]
*  to really determine who I say good morning to [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3033.6800000000003s)]
*  and who I say good night to every single night. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3036.12s)]
*  And I had to take a step back [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3038.52s)]
*  because I really don't care what people think, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3039.92s)]
*  but then I really did. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3041.88s)]
*  And so it was kind of just like that evaluation [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3043.16s)]
*  and looking myself in the mirror. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3045.28s)]
*  When did you realize? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3046.44s)]
*  When I didn't fight it? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3047.7200000000003s)]
*  I would say we were at a museum. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3050.48s)]
*  I'm a big nerd. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3052.84s)]
*  I love all types of museums. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3054.36s)]
*  And it was her mind. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3057.16s)]
*  It was her knowledge and just her ability [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3058.44s)]
*  to carry a conversation. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3061.52s)]
*  And my brother says something. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3062.52s)]
*  When her and I got married, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3063.84s)]
*  my brother said something that really stuck out to me. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3065.28s)]
*  And he said, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3067.96s)]
*  Candace needs somebody that's strong enough [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3068.8s)]
*  to put her in her place, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3071.02s)]
*  but soft enough where she feels vulnerable [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3072.36s)]
*  and an ability to kind of lay her head on her shoulder [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3075.8s)]
*  and be that vulnerable person. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3078.36s)]
*  And when I realized I was doing that, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3080.96s)]
*  she would say stuff and I wouldn't have any response. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3084.1600000000003s)]
*  And at first, some of my friends were like, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3086.76s)]
*  hold on, who is she? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3088.2000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3089.28s)]
*  Because that's not normally what happens. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3090.6400000000003s)]
*  And then the same thing where I would confess things [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3092.44s)]
*  that were bothering me or have issues [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3095.4s)]
*  and be comfortable enough to share. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3098.92s)]
*  I think that's when I noticed. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3100.76s)]
*  We're still kicking in with Candace Parker, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3102.88s)]
*  ex-WNBA player, two-time Olympic gold medalist. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3105.04s)]
*  And her new book, The Can Do Mindset is out right now. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3107.6800000000003s)]
*  Charlamagne? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3110.52s)]
*  Did the people in your life know how difficult it was [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3111.36s)]
*  for you to keep, I guess, her a secret? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3114.7200000000003s)]
*  Because I mean, in the book, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3117.0s)]
*  I got frustrated when you was talking about [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3118.6400000000003s)]
*  how you wanted to tell your brother, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3121.96s)]
*  but you didn't tell your brother. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3123.0s)]
*  I'm like, just tell him, he loves you. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3124.32s)]
*  But did they know or are they gonna read this book [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3126.56s)]
*  and realize for the first time? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3128.36s)]
*  Like damn, I didn't know it was that serious. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3129.56s)]
*  I've been on the other side of it [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3131.52s)]
*  where I've been the person that has been like, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3133.08s)]
*  everybody knows, just say it, just tell him. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3135.36s)]
*  But I think everybody comes to grips with it [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3138.4s)]
*  at a different time. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3140.48s)]
*  I know we live in a world that has Pride Month [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3141.4s)]
*  and has all of these things, but it is scary [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3144.36s)]
*  because you are put in another category. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3147.28s)]
*  You know, I'm already in two. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3150.32s)]
*  So now I'm gonna be put in a third [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3152.84s)]
*  and with someone that isn't black. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3154.6s)]
*  She's Russian and white. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3157.64s)]
*  And so- [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3159.08s)]
*  You wrote that in the book, yeah? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3159.92s)]
*  I mean, I think it's one of those things [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3160.8s)]
*  where it's like, what am I getting myself into? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3162.6400000000003s)]
*  And I know my family's gonna love me. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3164.6800000000003s)]
*  My brother was amazing throughout the entire process. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3166.8s)]
*  My family was great, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3169.88s)]
*  but my wife's parents didn't talk to her [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3171.2400000000002s)]
*  for almost a year. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3173.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, like we had family members [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3174.76s)]
*  that we have separated ourselves from [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3176.92s)]
*  because in front, with my family and with my kids, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3179.1600000000003s)]
*  this is the standard. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3182.88s)]
*  Like this is how we're gonna be treated. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3183.92s)]
*  And so we couldn't go through this process ourselves [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3185.5200000000004s)]
*  and help others go through it. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3188.2400000000002s)]
*  So we had to do it ourselves, be okay with it, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3190.04s)]
*  be strong enough, and then, you know, go forward with it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3192.6s)]
*  You can't rush it. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3195.48s)]
*  The sexuality part was one aspect of it, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3196.56s)]
*  but you also talked about the race aspect of it. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3198.56s)]
*  Like you really cared what Dr. Umar thought that much? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3200.52s)]
*  No, but it's a different dynamic when you walk it. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3206.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3210.48s)]
*  Like, first of all, like even with our kids, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3211.32s)]
*  it's like, you know, they have a black mom and a white mom. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3214.4s)]
*  And, you know, it's like navigating the race element [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3217.68s)]
*  and the conversations we've grown up in [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3221.2799999999997s)]
*  two completely different countries. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3222.68s)]
*  So having those conversations, like, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3225.24s)]
*  she's not coming from a place of understanding [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3227.24s)]
*  through experience. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3229.68s)]
*  And so like, even so, we're confident [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3230.7599999999998s)]
*  and we're cool within our household, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3234.2s)]
*  but it's like you don't understand the other noise [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3236.16s)]
*  that could mess that up, if that makes sense. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3238.16s)]
*  Have there ever been a time where you dimmed your light [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3241.12s)]
*  to make others feel comfortable, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3243.12s)]
*  especially in rooms full of men? [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3244.72s)]
*  100%. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3246.12s)]
*  You know, it's so funny. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3247.04s)]
*  I was sitting on the shop and it was with Draymond Green, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3247.88s)]
*  Bron was there, Mav was there. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3252.12s)]
*  And they were like, you know, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3255.2s)]
*  people don't understand what it's like to be a black man [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3256.36s)]
*  and be the only one in the meeting. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3258.52s)]
*  And I was looking around like, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3260.04s)]
*  like what? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3261.4s)]
*  Y'all really just said that, like read the room. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3265.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3267.52s)]
*  So I think sometimes you have to pick your battles [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3268.4s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3271.32s)]
*  As a teammate, my job is to make those around me better. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3272.24s)]
*  So same thing when you're sitting at these tables. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3275.56s)]
*  Like the point isn't to make people feel stupid [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3277.84s)]
*  or feel small. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3280.88s)]
*  The point is to make them understand the need [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3281.88s)]
*  for different voices at the table. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3285.48s)]
*  And I would say diversity of thought. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3288.08s)]
*  I've sat at so many tables and been the only, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3290.88s)]
*  I'm comfortable, but I'm tired of being the only. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3294.2799999999997s)]
*  When I went into TNT as the only female on that set, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3297.4s)]
*  a lot of people think, hey, I want you, you know, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3301.92s)]
*  you trying to be one of the guys. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3305.32s)]
*  Like, no, I'm trying to be one of the players. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3306.6000000000004s)]
*  That's it. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3308.6800000000003s)]
*  So treat me as such. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3309.5200000000004s)]
*  The way I see the game is way different than Shaq. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3310.6800000000003s)]
*  Shaq, throw the ball down low. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3312.76s)]
*  Barbecue chicken. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3314.1600000000003s)]
*  Shaq, other people have to do moves. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3315.0s)]
*  We can't just- [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3316.8s)]
*  We just can't. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3317.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes, but like the way he played was just so dominant [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3318.8s)]
*  that he doesn't understand [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3321.76s)]
*  that people have to do stuff to score. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3323.1600000000003s)]
*  He's like, just throw it down there and score. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3325.1600000000003s)]
*  And it's like, Cat can't do that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3327.1200000000003s)]
*  He's not, do you know what I mean? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3328.88s)]
*  I'm not saying, but Cat can't do that. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3330.5200000000004s)]
*  D-Wade and I, we can't do that. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3333.16s)]
*  We have to do moves and use the mental aspect [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3334.7999999999997s)]
*  and element of it. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3338.2799999999997s)]
*  But I feel like the value that is brought to the table, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3339.3199999999997s)]
*  if you had 15 Shaqs, what? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3342.12s)]
*  At, you know, as analysts, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3344.3999999999996s)]
*  but he brings value to the equation [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3346.04s)]
*  because he was so dominant. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3348.96s)]
*  And it gives you a bird's eye view of like dominance. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3350.96s)]
*  And so I just think anytime you have different people [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3353.48s)]
*  at the table, you're gonna bring different perspectives. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3356.56s)]
*  Like, why not? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3358.96s)]
*  And so it just drives me crazy. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3360.04s)]
*  I watched first tape. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3362.48s)]
*  I liked Stephen A. Smith. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3363.52s)]
*  He's super knowledgeable about the game, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3364.76s)]
*  but like the people that comment under my posts [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3366.32s)]
*  about how I'm a woman, I never played the NBA [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3369.96s)]
*  and I should shut the F up and blah, blah, blah. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3372.12s)]
*  But they are like, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3374.36s)]
*  Stephen A. Smith has the Bible for the NBA. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3375.48s)]
*  And it's like, he hasn't even played either. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3377.96s)]
*  But it's just because, you know, he's a man. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3380.28s)]
*  And so I just am continuing to fight that stigma. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3383.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm open for the challenge. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3385.92s)]
*  I'm up for it. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3387.08s)]
*  Grew up with two older brothers. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3388.16s)]
*  All we did was make fun of each other. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3389.2s)]
*  So I'm game. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3390.68s)]
*  I can speak that language, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3392.2s)]
*  but it's just having the opportunity to like [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3393.3599999999997s)]
*  separate myself, like don't like me as an analyst, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3395.4399999999996s)]
*  but don't not like me because I'm a woman. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3398.3199999999997s)]
*  That's my thing. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3400.2799999999997s)]
*  Is there a WNBA teammate you didn't appreciate [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3401.12s)]
*  in the moment, but now you realize [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3403.3199999999997s)]
*  that person was vital to your growth? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3404.7999999999997s)]
*  That's a really, really, really great question. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3406.6s)]
*  I would say I appreciated her in the moment, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3409.6s)]
*  but I don't think I appreciated her enough in the moment. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3413.12s)]
*  I would say definitely Delisha Milton Jones. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3416.08s)]
*  I think she's someone that was in the league [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3419.12s)]
*  for such a long time. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3421.34s)]
*  She had such an amazing career, longevity, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3422.3s)]
*  won championships with the Sparks, played different roles, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3425.36s)]
*  played key roles, came off the bench. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3427.6600000000003s)]
*  Like she did it all. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3429.06s)]
*  And so I think she genuinely wanted me to succeed. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3430.58s)]
*  And you know, I was a rookie when she was there [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3433.82s)]
*  and you know, we got in some brawls alongside. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3436.06s)]
*  She beat me up in practice coming off screens. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3438.7000000000003s)]
*  And it was like all that was tough love [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3440.78s)]
*  because she loved me. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3442.3s)]
*  And you know, you talk about a lot of things in the book, [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3443.1400000000003s)]
*  but what's something you haven't forgiven yourself for yet, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3444.82s)]
*  even if nobody else knows about it? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3447.78s)]
*  I would say I struggled for a long time [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3450.1s)]
*  in the closing seconds of games mentally. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3452.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3455.62s)]
*  I did because the results didn't work out for me. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3456.44s)]
*  I talk about that a lot in this book [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3459.06s)]
*  about how naive I was my rookie year. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3461.1s)]
*  We lost by a last second shot. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3463.38s)]
*  Nine years later, I was still losing by last second shots. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3465.02s)]
*  And I felt myself in those moments tense up [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3467.64s)]
*  when prior I would relish in those moments. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3470.22s)]
*  Like I would be, I'd want the ball [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3472.8199999999997s)]
*  and I would find myself shying away from those moments [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3474.62s)]
*  because I had conceded to the fact [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3477.2999999999997s)]
*  that it was just not gonna work out. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3479.34s)]
*  And it took my brother, it took me finally realizing [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3480.9s)]
*  how to relinquish results and just live in the process. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3485.9s)]
*  The dash, right? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3489.1400000000003s)]
*  Enjoying the journey. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3490.78s)]
*  It took a Kobe Bryant text message to me [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3491.98s)]
*  that was like, it's better the hard way. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3494.7000000000003s)]
*  You don't die with bullets in the chamber, right? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3496.1000000000004s)]
*  Like you go down shooting. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3499.3s)]
*  It was that text message and just the support [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3501.38s)]
*  from my family and friends that allowed me [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3504.0s)]
*  to win the championship. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3505.48s)]
*  And it came down to the closing moments. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3506.5s)]
*  And in those moments, I just played [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3508.22s)]
*  and it could have not worked out. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3510.4599999999996s)]
*  It could have worked out. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3511.7s)]
*  But I just, since that time when I lose, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3512.62s)]
*  I'm not in bed for four or five days. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3515.4599999999996s)]
*  Like I'm gonna commit to the process. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3517.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm gonna commit to the grind. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3519.14s)]
*  I'm gonna honestly try to stay at that [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3520.56s)]
*  like even keeled mentality. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3522.02s)]
*  And that's in life as well. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3523.98s)]
*  And I wholeheartedly believe things will work out [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3525.4199999999996s)]

*  the back and forth questioning [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3648.2200000000003s)]

*  And they came back and was like, listen, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3651.92s)]
*  the way that you are having a conversation with her, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3654.64s)]
*  it's hostile, like it's too much. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3656.92s)]

*  Like I'm not gonna lie. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3668.96s)]
*  He's saying it like I say it. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3669.8s)]
*  100%, everything was being objective, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3671.6800000000003s)]
*  but he still kept going. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3673.36s)]
*  Did it look like it helped or it hurt? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3674.7200000000003s)]
*  At first I thought it was hurting [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3677.6s)]
*  because she's up there talking about [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3679.04s)]
*  she can't remember certain things [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3681.32s)]
*  when it comes to her sexual assault [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3683.0s)]
*  or she doesn't know why she kept reaching back out [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3684.36s)]
*  to Diddy via text and different things [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3687.1200000000003s)]
*  after she was no longer an employee with him. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3689.28s)]
*  And after she received a settlement, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3691.36s)]
*  after they decided to go split ways as an employee [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3692.52s)]
*  because of mental health. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3695.6800000000003s)]
*  Like she was blaming a lot of things on mental health, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3697.0800000000004s)]
*  not blaming, but she was referring to her mental health [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3698.84s)]
*  and her conditions and not really understanding herself [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3701.04s)]
*  why she was still in such a hold. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3702.96s)]
*  And I'm like, yo, he's being so aggressive. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3705.2000000000003s)]
*  But then I'm watching it and I'm like, wait, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3706.96s)]
*  if all you got is like her account of things [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3709.7599999999998s)]
*  because there's no text messages or no emails, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3712.0s)]
*  there's no anything written where she's telling a friend [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3713.9599999999996s)]
*  about the alleged events, not even just sexual assault, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3716.68s)]
*  but like having to get on a boat and paddle away from Diddy [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3719.24s)]
*  and in the water at one point. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3722.08s)]
*  Where the hell was they at? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3723.9199999999996s)]
*  Last week she talked about that, like having to get on, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3725.9199999999996s)]
*  it wasn't a boat. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3728.0s)]
*  She said it was like a, those little boards, like a- [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3728.8399999999997s)]
*  Canoe, paddle board? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3732.04s)]
*  Yeah, paddle board. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3733.12s)]
*  She said she had to get on a paddle board at one point [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3734.3599999999997s)]
*  to get away from him doing like one of his like [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3736.2s)]
*  alleged like crazy- [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3738.2799999999997s)]
*  Rant, nepotism. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3739.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and then the Prince party incident, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3740.6s)]
*  that alleged incident when Diddy came out [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3744.2799999999997s)]
*  and was trying to drag her and Cassie back into the party [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3746.24s)]
*  because he was mad she was there. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3748.9599999999996s)]
*  Brian still was like, so all of these things happen, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3751.04s)]
*  like these big events, there's no photo, there's no video [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3753.72s)]
*  and you used to document everything for Diddy. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3756.2s)]
*  You didn't text a friend, you never emailed anybody. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3758.3199999999997s)]
*  There's nothing written in solid. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3761.12s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, so now you just gotta hang on [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3763.7599999999998s)]
*  what she's saying. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3765.56s)]
*  And it's like, do you believe her or not? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3766.3999999999996s)]
*  But she's very timid and Brian still was like, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3767.44s)]
*  nope, that's a lie, nope, that's a lie. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3769.96s)]
*  And I'm like, well, if I'm a juror, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3771.7200000000003s)]
*  now you gotta believe him or her. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3773.52s)]
*  And he is bringing these things around full circle. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3774.76s)]
*  So I think, not even think, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3777.96s)]
*  I have a friend that was actually in the court [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3779.92s)]
*  because I was in the overflow room. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3781.6s)]
*  In the actual court where you could see the jurors [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3783.12s)]
*  who said that the jurors were reacting to the questioning, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3784.68s)]
*  the line of questioning, like openly reacting, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3788.0s)]
*  like they would, you know, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3789.96s)]
*  when she couldn't answer certain questions, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  it's like, okay, wait, like they're not saying it, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3792.64s)]
*  but you can see in facial inspections and things like that [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3794.64s)]
*  that they were like, oh wow, okay, what's happening? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3796.56s)]
*  Because that's how we all felt in the overflow room, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3799.48s)]
*  like, wow, Brian still is destroying her right now. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3801.32s)]
*  So I thought it was kind of effective, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3804.7999999999997s)]
*  but up next on the stand, you have a video expert [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3806.2799999999997s)]
*  who's gonna talk about that video [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3809.88s)]
*  from the Intercontinental Hotel [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3810.7599999999998s)]
*  because Diddy's team is saying that that video [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3812.0s)]
*  was like sped up. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3813.48s)]
*  You have, you know, a witness, Jane Doe, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3814.64s)]
*  who's also gonna speak to some allegations as well. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3818.84s)]
*  But at this point, again, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3822.18s)]
*  I really think that it's time for Diddy's team [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3823.72s)]
*  to be like the government, the rest, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3825.44s)]
*  Diddy's team to come up and bring their witnesses on [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3827.36s)]
*  because- [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3829.36s)]
*  Do we know who Diddy's witnesses are? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3830.28s)]
*  No, and I've been trying to figure that out. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3831.8s)]
*  Who, how, who's gonna get on that stand? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3833.6800000000003s)]
*  Because that- [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3836.12s)]
*  They said if Diddy's gonna get on the stand? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3836.96s)]
*  They have not said- [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3838.48s)]
*  He should. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3839.64s)]
*  I think Diddy should get on the stand [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3841.0s)]
*  and Diddy should be the defense's number one witness. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3842.52s)]
*  Diddy should get on the stand [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3844.92s)]
*  and basically throw himself at the mercy of the court. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3846.0s)]
*  He should be as, he should just be honest [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3847.92s)]
*  about everything that has happened in his life [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3850.08s)]
*  from day one. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3851.8s)]
*  They should basically just lay out a bio for Diddy [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3853.7999999999997s)]
*  from the time he lost his father [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3856.16s)]
*  to losing his best friends like Wolf and Biggie [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3858.44s)]
*  and Kim Porter and Andre. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3863.44s)]
*  Just lay it all out. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3865.8799999999997s)]
*  Just lay out a story of trauma and sadness [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3866.72s)]
*  and how he turned to drugs and alcohol and everything. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3870.8799999999997s)]
*  He should just get on the stand and just lay it all out. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3875.96s)]
*  Just lay it, just throw yourself on the mercy of the court. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3879.2799999999997s)]
*  Well- [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3882.4s)]
*  Face down, ass up. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3883.2400000000002s)]
*  I knew that was coming out. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3885.6800000000003s)]
*  I was like, come on, bring it on. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3886.52s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3887.84s)]
*  Lay yourself out, spread him and just- [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3888.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes, I'm not even joking. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3890.76s)]
*  He should be- [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3892.2000000000003s)]
*  Spread him. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3893.1600000000003s)]
*  He should be the star witness for the defense [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3894.0s)]
*  and he should just go out there [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3896.96s)]
*  and just throw himself on the mercy of the court. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3898.1600000000003s)]
*  Talk about all the tragedy, all the trauma he's been through, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3900.04s)]
*  how he had to turn to drugs and alcohol and everything else [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3902.88s)]
*  and he was wild. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3906.0s)]
*  Well, he's gonna do something [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3907.52s)]
*  because they bring in so much difference. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3909.6s)]
*  I have a friend of mine who's a home grabber [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3911.08s)]
*  brought up R. Kelly. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3911.88s)]
*  She said she had a- [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3912.72s)]
*  R. Kelly? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3913.56s)]
*  I saw that, I saw something. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3914.4s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3915.24s)]
*  After talking about, you know, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3916.08s)]
*  because she alleged she had been raped and all these things [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3917.44s)]
*  and Brian still is like, wait, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3919.32s)]
*  but all these years later, you're texting Diddy talking about [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3920.88s)]
*  you had a dream about R. Kelly that she was in an elevator [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3923.36s)]
*  and that he saved you from R. Kelly allegedly. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3925.44s)]
*  Why would you text someone who you're saying raped you [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3928.0s)]
*  about saving you from another person? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3931.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's like- [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3933.6s)]
*  And I'm really crying like, I didn't even meet you. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3934.44s)]
*  How he save you from me? [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3937.32s)]
*  It was a dream. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3939.44s)]
*  It was a dream. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3940.32s)]
*  It was a dream. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3941.1600000000003s)]
*  But there are psychologists who've been breaking us down [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3942.0s)]
*  and said that's like, you know, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3943.2000000000003s)]
*  that can be like her innermost thoughts and I don't know. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3944.48s)]
*  It's a lot. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3947.6800000000003s)]
*  But real quick, as we wrap up, I know we, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3948.8s)]
*  Envy, we got the Clips record now. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3951.0800000000004s)]
*  Yes, I always had the Clips record. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3953.1600000000003s)]
*  I always had the Clips record. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3955.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I had the double check. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3956.6800000000003s)]
*  We talked about earlier in the last hour, the latest, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3957.6800000000003s)]
*  the Clips sat down with GQ Magazine and talked about, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3960.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, a ton of different things. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3962.96s)]
*  We didn't mention the Kanye stuff that they spoke about [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3964.88s)]
*  and Pusha T seemed really heartbroken in the article [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3966.88s)]
*  talking about splitting ways with Kanye [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3969.2799999999997s)]
*  and where they are now and saying that they good. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3971.68s)]
*  It's not gonna, it ain't there for him no more. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3973.6s)]
*  And you don't even look at Kanye as a man. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3975.7999999999997s)]
*  But I say all that to say, please go read that article. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3977.72s)]
*  And now we have the music. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3979.7599999999998s)]
*  I always had the Clips record. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3980.9599999999996s)]
*  It was in my Serato. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3982.2s)]
*  Just wasn't in the station's computer. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3983.04s)]
*  Could you shut up and play it [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3983.8799999999997s)]
*  so we can have time to hear it before donkey of the day? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=3984.72s)]

*  to disasters and emergencies, both natural and manmade. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4076.88s)]

*  You can't tell me DEI hires have no qualifications, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4112.16s)]
*  but then turn around and hire people with no qualifications. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4115.5599999999995s)]

*  Of course you have. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4127.2s)]
*  It started on June 1st and ends November 30th. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4128.04s)]
*  I am from Moncks Corner, South Carolina. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4130.48s)]
*  I lived through Hurricane Hugo, 1989, okay? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4132.24s)]
*  I was 11 to 12 years old, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4134.76s)]
*  so I know all about a hurricane season. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4135.8s)]
*  Well, if I know about hurricane seasons, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4137.44s)]
*  and Envy and Jess know about hurricane seasons, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4140.16s)]

*  What are you talking about, Uncle Sharla? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4148.08s)]
*  Well, let's go to CBS News for the report, please. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4149.76s)]
*  Multiple sources say staff at FEMA were left surprised [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4151.72s)]
*  when the agency's new acting head said he didn't know [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4154.88s)]
*  the US had a hurricane season. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4158.12s)]
*  David Richardson reportedly made the comments [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4160.04s)]
*  during a briefing Monday. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4162.4s)]
*  A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson says [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4164.0s)]
*  it was made in Jess. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4166.76s)]
*  But some staffers are concerned since Richardson [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4168.68s)]
*  has no prior experience managing natural disasters. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4172.0s)]
*  The acting administrator for FEMA just found out [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4179.280000000001s)]
*  that America has a hurricane season. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4182.08s)]
*  Wait until he finds out that water is wet [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4185.320000000001s)]
*  and the sky is blue, okay? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4187.08s)]
*  Can you imagine if the head of NASA said out loud, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4188.360000000001s)]
*  wait, we go to space? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4190.72s)]
*  These are the same people rebelling against DEI [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4192.8s)]
*  because the people they feel are hired through DEI [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4195.48s)]
*  are unqualified. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4198.759999999999s)]
*  They don't believe your identity should be the reason [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4199.919999999999s)]
*  you get hired for a job, and I agree. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4202.2s)]
*  But that should also apply to old white males as well [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4204.36s)]
*  because damn it, from Pete Hegsep to David Richardson, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4208.639999999999s)]
*  we just keep getting examples of mediocre, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4211.5199999999995s)]
*  unqualified white males, okay? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4214.32s)]

*  That's like the surgeon general saying, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4220.879999999999s)]
*  wait, people have organs? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4222.639999999999s)]
*  Yes, there are some seasons we just know. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4224.84s)]
*  Pumpkin spice lattes in the fall, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4227.84s)]
*  egg dog and coquito during the holidays, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4230.12s)]
*  hurricanes now, okay? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4232.6s)]
*  This isn't some random guy on YouTube. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4235.24s)]
*  This isn't a podcaster. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4237.4400000000005s)]
*  This isn't some essay standing outside of Home Depot. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4239.0s)]
*  This is the head of FEMA, okay? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4241.56s)]
*  This man is supposed to be the one warning us [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4244.76s)]
*  to brace for impact, not asking, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4246.92s)]
*  wait, we have a hurricane season? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4249.12s)]
*  We are doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, I tell you. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4251.68s)]
*  You know what else David Richardson did in this meeting? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4255.8s)]
*  According to CNN, he announced that FEMA [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4257.84s)]
*  will not release an updated disaster plan [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4260.360000000001s)]
*  for this hurricane season as previously promised. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4263.4800000000005s)]
*  Instead, FEMA will largely default back [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4266.16s)]
*  to its operating procedure from last year. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4268.68s)]
*  Though the agency enters this hurricane season [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4271.56s)]
*  in turmoil with a dramatically smaller workforce, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4274.16s)]
*  what could go wrong? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4277.72s)]
*  Just our luck, it will be the worst hurricane season [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4279.88s)]
*  in years, I pray not. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4282.6s)]
*  I pray, pray, pray not. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4284.16s)]
*  But some life lessons we must learn the hard way. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4285.36s)]
*  And oh, this big, beautiful country [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4288.08s)]
*  we call America is gonna learn now. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4290.2s)]

*  saying, Charlamagne, you idiot, he was joking. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4294.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, as I just said, he is considering reverting FEMA [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4297.5199999999995s)]

*  So the only joke here will probably be [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4305.08s)]
*  the agency's preparation for a natural disaster, okay? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4307.5599999999995s)]
*  They are really just planning to recycle [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4311.32s)]
*  last year's plan. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4313.28s)]
*  FEMA officials' hurricane training this year [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4314.24s)]
*  consisted of Control plus C, Control plus V, okay? [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4317.599999999999s)]
*  America, I am completely flabbergasted. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4322.08s)]
*  As long as David Richardson is the head of FEMA, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4324.88s)]
*  FEMA should stand for forget every major alert. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4327.32s)]
*  Don't even worry about the category four [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4330.38s)]

*  Let it sneak up on us, okay? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4334.5199999999995s)]
*  FEMA should stand for forget expectations. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4336.0s)]
*  Make assumptions. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4338.98s)]
*  Since David Richardson just assumed [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4340.92s)]
*  that we didn't have a hurricane season, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4342.64s)]
*  America, if the head of FEMA doesn't know [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4344.280000000001s)]
*  we have a hurricane season, we are doomed, okay? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4346.400000000001s)]

*  I'd read a quote once, and the quote was, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4353.84s)]
*  "'When you're willing to do what you're unqualified to do, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4356.56s)]
*  "'that's what qualifies you.'" [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4360.96s)]
*  I must say I disagree, okay? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4364.04s)]
*  Certain positions, certain jobs, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4365.96s)]
*  you just have to simply be qualified for. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4368.12s)]
*  You have to be simply qualified to do. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4371.48s)]
*  And if you don't know that there is a hurricane season, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4373.879999999999s)]

*  Congressman Eric Swalwell, welcome. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4476.799999999999s)]
*  Hey, thanks for having me on. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4478.5599999999995s)]
*  How you feeling today? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4479.4s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4480.24s)]
*  I'm good. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4481.08s)]
*  You got such an interesting story [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4482.04s)]
*  because you're a Democrat out of California, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4483.16s)]
*  but you were raised, your parents were Republican. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4485.92s)]
*  So you were a Republican at one point. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4488.759999999999s)]
*  What made you switch sides, so to speak? [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4490.32s)]
*  They would tell you, they would blame college. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4492.32s)]
*  I was the first to go to college. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4494.5599999999995s)]
*  And so they're like, oh, he got brainwashed [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4495.639999999999s)]
*  by those college liberal professors. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4497.28s)]
*  But no, the truth is my dad was a cop. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4500.08s)]
*  My mom worked a number of odd jobs. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4501.879999999999s)]
*  Made wedding cakes, did ceramics, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4504.5599999999995s)]
*  ran like a very large, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4506.48s)]
*  probably unlicensed daycare facility [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4508.04s)]
*  with me and my little brothers. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4510.16s)]
*  And I was the first one to be able to kind of get out. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4511.4s)]
*  And when I left the town I grew up in, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4514.28s)]
*  it was called Dublin, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4517.92s)]
*  and everyone around us called it Scrublin. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4518.96s)]
*  I started to realize that, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4521.92s)]
*  and I think very much resented, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4523.68s)]
*  that it felt like there were two paths of opportunity [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4526.08s)]
*  in America, certainly in my community, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4529.400000000001s)]
*  which was if your parents knew someone [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4531.12s)]
*  or they had means or they had connections, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4533.4400000000005s)]
*  you could go and try and be anything. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4536.88s)]
*  And if they didn't, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4539.08s)]
*  then you had to work your ass off [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4540.24s)]
*  probably twice as hard as anyone else. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4541.68s)]
*  And so I started looking at different political parties [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4544.36s)]
*  and I thought, well, Democrats believe [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4547.96s)]
*  in kind of a free market approach, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4551.2s)]
*  which is like when we're at our best, I think, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4553.6s)]
*  that if you work hard, no matter who you are, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4556.24s)]
*  you should do better and dream bigger. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4558.28s)]
*  And Republicans, I saw, was like a free for all approach. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4561.32s)]
*  But yeah, my parents are still Republicans today. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4564.6s)]
*  I have three little brothers. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4566.64s)]
*  They don't talk about it that much, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4567.88s)]
*  but I'm pretty sure I know who they voted for. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4569.2s)]
*  And I married a girl from Southern Indiana [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4571.92s)]
*  who grew up in the same town as the Pences. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4573.64s)]
*  Her mom was the Pence family dentist [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4576.6s)]
*  until she retired last year. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4578.68s)]
*  So I have to go on Fox News [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4579.84s)]
*  if anyone in my family is gonna see me on TV. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4581.92s)]
*  Was it a particular moment or situation [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4584.4800000000005s)]
*  that made you be like, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4587.240000000001s)]
*  I don't lean towards conservative anymore? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4588.160000000001s)]
*  It was in the Bush presidency, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4591.360000000001s)]
*  seeing a lot of people that I grew up with go off to Iraq [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4594.92s)]
*  and feeling like it was bullsh**, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4600.8s)]
*  like what they were being told [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4603.64s)]
*  and that it was really more just a power grab [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4605.44s)]
*  and an oil grab. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4608.24s)]
*  And it wasn't about the reasons that they were being told. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4609.5599999999995s)]
*  I think that was kind of, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4612.4s)]
*  that completed for me the transformation, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4613.5199999999995s)]
*  but it was really more about opportunity. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4615.639999999999s)]
*  Because as I said, like I grew up [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4617.08s)]
*  in a very like working class home [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4618.599999999999s)]
*  and the towns that were around us were very wealthy. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4621.24s)]
*  And so because I played competitive soccer, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4624.96s)]
*  I got to see, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4627.08s)]
*  and our town didn't have a competitive soccer team. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4628.24s)]
*  So I played in like the wealthier towns teams. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4630.24s)]
*  And I got to see like what the richer kids thought [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4633.12s)]
*  of the poor kids by playing on their teams. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4635.88s)]
*  And honestly, it was a little bit of just like [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4638.32s)]
*  resenting that they were able to take shortcuts [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4640.72s)]
*  and people who worked hard, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4643.44s)]
*  like they just, they had to do it twice as hard. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4645.24s)]
*  And I thought, well, one party actually thinks [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4647.28s)]
*  if we all have about the same opportunity, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4649.72s)]
*  and then you're defined by how hard you work, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4651.92s)]
*  not by who you know. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4653.88s)]
*  And I thought the democratic party [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4654.92s)]
*  embodied that more than the Republican party. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4656.6s)]
*  You think we'll ever get back to [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4658.5599999999995s)]
*  centrist politics ever again? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4660.88s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4662.68s)]
*  I mean, I was also, you know, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4663.52s)]
*  I came of age when Bill Clinton was president [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4664.76s)]
*  and I thought, you know, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4666.64s)]
*  he was very good at trying to find like what's possible. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4667.88s)]
*  And I see myself as wanting to do this job, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4670.88s)]
*  you know, to solve problems [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4672.92s)]
*  and be in the solutions business. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4674.240000000001s)]
*  And today it feels very like just zero sum, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4675.76s)]
*  like whoever wins the other side says that this is it. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4680.0s)]
*  And that actually goes back, you know, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4683.52s)]
*  you had the search and destroy under Bill Clinton, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4685.4400000000005s)]
*  when they wanted to do anything [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4687.8s)]
*  over a sex scandal to destroy the guy. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4690.44s)]
*  And then George Bush comes in [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4693.12s)]
*  and I would say Democrats are probably guilty [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4694.28s)]
*  of saying like, this is, you know, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4696.36s)]
*  the most existential threat to our country. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4697.839999999999s)]
*  You know, we're gonna lose our country [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4700.12s)]
*  if George Bush is reelected. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4701.839999999999s)]
*  And then Obama comes in [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4703.24s)]
*  and you get like this birtherism bull. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4704.28s)]
*  And then when the real threat came in Donald Trump, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4706.28s)]
*  I think most Americans were like, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4708.759999999999s)]
*  okay, that's just what you guys say. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4709.92s)]
*  Every time. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4711.4s)]
*  That's just what you say. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4712.24s)]
*  So when the real threat was there, [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4713.0599999999995s)]
*  we probably didn't appreciate it. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4715.04s)]
*  I wanna ask, what do you think the biggest thing [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4716.799999999999s)]
*  that the Democrats got wrong in the last election? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4719.12s)]
*  Immigration and public safety. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4721.12s)]
*  40% of my constituents were born outside the United States. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4722.92s)]
*  It's probably one of the largest [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4725.4s)]
*  like groups of immigrant communities you'll find in America. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4726.92s)]
*  And we also happen to be today, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4730.96s)]
*  because we've embraced immigration, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4734.32s)]
*  one of the wealthiest districts now in America. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4735.68s)]
*  So there's a straight line between [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4738.4s)]
*  having people who left everything, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4740.24s)]
*  showed resilience, created something [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4742.48s)]
*  and like the wealth they can create in their community. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4744.66s)]
*  Right? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4746.48s)]
*  Legal immigration channels, there's no end. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4747.5199999999995s)]
*  But the American people, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4750.04s)]
*  they're not gonna let you solve the workforce crisis [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4751.5599999999995s)]
*  in agriculture, in hospitality, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4754.44s)]
*  in restaurants, food and beverage. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4756.759999999999s)]
*  They're not gonna let you attack that [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4758.799999999999s)]
*  until they see security at the border. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4761.12s)]
*  And the perception that the border was out of control [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4763.24s)]
*  and the reality that the border was out of control [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4765.88s)]
*  was a problem. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4767.96s)]
*  So I think if we had just doubled down and said, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4768.799999999999s)]
*  yeah, we want border security. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4770.4s)]
*  We want, if people are gonna make asylum claims, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4771.84s)]
*  we're gonna put resources there [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4774.4s)]
*  to adjudicate those claims as quickly as possible. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4776.64s)]
*  But if it's seen that all you have to do [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4778.96s)]
*  is just come to the United States [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4780.72s)]
*  or like cross an insecure border [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4782.04s)]
*  and then you can have access to resources, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4784.68s)]
*  people aren't gonna want to hear your plan [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4788.200000000001s)]
*  to have a million people come here and work [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4790.52s)]
*  on the jobs that really need to be filled. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4793.52s)]
*  And so I think we just weren't seen strong enough [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4795.68s)]
*  on that issue. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4798.360000000001s)]
*  And then on law and order, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4799.200000000001s)]
*  I think we rightfully fought for criminal justice reform. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4800.76s)]
*  Rightfully. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4804.200000000001s)]
*  But we were too much identified [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4805.24s)]
*  as like a defund the police party. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4807.92s)]
*  And I think you can have both. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4809.96s)]
*  People want safety in their community. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4811.44s)]
*  They also don't want like the wrong person going to jail [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4813.24s)]
*  or people going to jail for petty, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4815.84s)]
*  but they wanna feel safe in the community. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4817.88s)]
*  And we weren't perceived as a party [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4819.32s)]
*  that was gonna keep you safe. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4821.16s)]
*  I think Democrats miss people though, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4822.36s)]
*  because when you talk about home ownership [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4823.8s)]
*  and small businesses, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4826.4s)]
*  that's literally like a middle-class thing. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4828.24s)]
*  Like, you know how hard it is [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4830.44s)]
*  to be able to afford a home? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4832.08s)]
*  Like some people I'm talking about are just folks [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4834.400000000001s)]
*  who wanna find an apartment that's not $3,000 a month. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4836.64s)]
*  You know, they just wanna have a couple of meals [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4840.4400000000005s)]
*  on their table, you know, throughout the day for their kids. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4841.96s)]
*  Like this, that, like we never speak to that. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4845.0s)]
*  It feels like we always talk to the middle-class [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4847.4400000000005s)]
*  and above that, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4850.72s)]
*  but we never talk to who's Lord in the middle-class. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4851.56s)]
*  But I want us to be aspirational. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4852.88s)]
*  And I think a weakness of the Democratic party is, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4854.280000000001s)]
*  my parents would tell you when people told them [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4857.320000000001s)]
*  that as Republicans, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4860.52s)]
*  they were voting against their interests, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4861.4400000000005s)]
*  because we lived in 13 different houses. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4862.8s)]
*  I went to 11 different schools [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4864.8s)]
*  before I graduated high school. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4866.0s)]
*  And people would say, well, you're Republican [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4867.64s)]
*  and you're voting for Republicans. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4869.92s)]
*  The Democrats are the ones that are gonna protect people [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4872.92s)]
*  in your economic class. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4874.76s)]
*  And my parents, my mom would say, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4876.16s)]
*  my interest is not being poor. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4878.12s)]
*  And so she saw the Republican party [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4881.0s)]
*  as talking to her as we are aspirational for you. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4882.8s)]
*  And I think Democrats at our best, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4886.72s)]
*  yes, I want us to have more inventory and housing [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4888.88s)]
*  so that the cost of housing comes down. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4891.96s)]
*  And in California, frankly, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4894.04s)]
*  a lot of the laws in California get in the way [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4895.8s)]
*  of builders and developers bringing more inventory [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4899.12s)]
*  on stock so that you can have more affordable housing. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4902.32s)]
*  Yes, I want that for people, just basic housing. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4904.6s)]
*  Yes, that is a need. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4907.04s)]
*  But I want people to aspire for ownership. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4908.56s)]
*  Because I think when you own a piece of America, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4913.28s)]
*  that fulfills the American promise, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4916.16s)]
*  that if you work hard, you can own something. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4918.16s)]
*  And for most Americans, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4920.48s)]
*  the greatest source of wealth is their home. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4922.12s)]
*  But more and more Americans, especially my generation, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4924.759999999999s)]
*  homeownership is out of reach. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4927.4s)]
*  Believe it or not, I'm still paying off student loan debt. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4928.639999999999s)]
*  I've got about $80,000 in student loan debt today. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4930.799999999999s)]
*  And many people like me who chased that dream [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4933.599999999999s)]
*  of being the first to go to college, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4936.12s)]
*  they're just in the quicksand of student loan debt. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4937.799999999999s)]
*  And they think that the American promise is bull. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4940.959999999999s)]
*  Because they don't own a piece of it. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4942.959999999999s)]
*  So I want us to be more aspirational, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4944.919999999999s)]
*  put more housing in America so that you increase [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4947.52s)]
*  the inventory and you increase the ability of people, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4950.72s)]
*  as I said, to have skin in the ownership game. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4953.320000000001s)]
*  But how do we get those poor and disenfranchised people [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4955.96s)]
*  to even get to a mindset of aspirational? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4958.320000000001s)]
*  Because right now they're just trying to survive. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4961.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it starts in school. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4962.400000000001s)]
*  And it's gonna get worse with AI. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4963.4400000000005s)]
*  So what we're seeing right now with AI [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4965.64s)]
*  is that you're gonna have people who learn the skills of AI [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4968.120000000001s)]
*  and they will do better for themselves [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4972.88s)]
*  because they know it. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4975.360000000001s)]
*  And you're gonna have a whole generation of people [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4976.24s)]
*  who never even had it in their classroom. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4978.12s)]
*  We still have Congressman Eric Swalwell in the building. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4979.76s)]
*  Now I wanted to ask, we look at Donald Trump [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4982.72s)]
*  and Donald Trump has been signing executive orders, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4984.92s)]
*  pardoning his people, his core. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4986.84s)]
*  To the people in the public, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4988.92s)]
*  it looks like he looks out for his own. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4989.88s)]
*  Democrats don't look like they look out for their own. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4991.88s)]
*  Talk about that a little bit. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4994.8s)]
*  Because somebody who sees that says, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4995.76s)]
*  well, why am I messing with Biden [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4997.12s)]
*  where Biden wouldn't pardon his best friend? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=4999.12s)]
*  He would pardon his son. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5001.48s)]
*  Wouldn't pardon his best friend. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5002.639999999999s)]
*  Would Donald Trump pardon anybody that rides for him? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5003.5599999999995s)]
*  He'd definitely pardon a lot of his best friends. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5006.56s)]
*  He wouldn't pardon Maryland. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5007.68s)]
*  I think the issue is Democrats are weak with power. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5008.52s)]
*  Say it again. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5012.52s)]
*  Democrats are weak when we have power. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5013.4800000000005s)]
*  So we had the White House, the House and the Senate [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5015.56s)]
*  and not a mom in America would say [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5019.0s)]
*  that her kid was safer at school. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5022.2s)]
*  So I have three little kids, my two oldest, [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5025.4800000000005s)]
*  they do mass shooter drills. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5027.52s)]
*  They're eight and they're six. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5028.84s)]
*  And so they would look at Democrats and say, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5030.72s)]
*  wait, we gave you that, holy trinity, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5032.36s)]
*  White House, Senate, House, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5034.56s)]
*  and y'all couldn't pass background checks [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5036.96s)]
*  or an assault weapons ban. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5039.400000000001s)]
*  And you let what, like the filibuster get in the way of it. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5040.76s)]
*  So if Democrats, and Republicans by the way, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5044.280000000001s)]
*  they will lean in with thin power [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5047.080000000001s)]
*  and pass unpopular positions. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5051.76s)]
*  So if we were as strong with power to pass popular positions, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5053.8s)]
*  imagine how people would perceive us. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5058.360000000001s)]
*  Almost 80% of gun owning Republicans [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5060.68s)]
*  believe in background checks. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5063.68s)]
*  And we couldn't even get that done. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5065.400000000001s)]
*  So I think the next president and the next Democratic [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5066.8s)]
*  majority has to flex when we have power. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5069.96s)]
*  I was reading the Wall Street Journal yesterday [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5072.72s)]
*  and they asked the question about David Hogg. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5074.64s)]
*  We had David Hogg a couple of weeks ago. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5076.84s)]
*  The question was, is David Hogg Democrats' [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5079.240000000001s)]
*  worst nightmare or their savior? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5080.88s)]
*  I'm on David's board. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5082.56s)]
*  And I was on his board when he founded it. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5083.84s)]
*  I've known him since Parkland [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5085.400000000001s)]
*  because that's the issue I care the most about. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5087.200000000001s)]
*  Look, David's not wrong that the question is not, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5089.360000000001s)]
*  are you far left or center left? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5093.4s)]
*  It's will you bring old tactics or new tactics? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5095.36s)]
*  I agree. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5098.5199999999995s)]
*  And if you're not up to bring new tactics [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5099.36s)]
*  to take on what's happening, [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5102.5599999999995s)]
*  then these times are revealing who should lead [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5104.36s)]
*  and who should leave. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5107.48s)]
*  I agree. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5109.04s)]
*  Why should we ever trust the Democratic party [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5109.879999999999s)]
*  after they lied to us so long about President Biden? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5111.28s)]
*  And I'm big on this because I just read the original sentence. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5113.839999999999s)]
*  I'm just like, I think that Democrats have tried [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5115.719999999999s)]
*  every strategy except for two things, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5119.839999999999s)]
*  honesty and courage. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5121.48s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of people who are courageous right now [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5124.16s)]
*  in the Democratic party. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5126.5199999999995s)]
*  Our bread and butter issue, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5128.04s)]
*  our dance with the one that brought you is healthcare. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5129.16s)]
*  People have always trusted us on healthcare. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5132.04s)]
*  That's our issue from President Johnson to President Obama [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5134.36s)]
*  to when Donald Trump tried to take it away. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5137.88s)]
*  That's how we won the house in 2018. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5139.44s)]
*  And now this reconciliation bill is gonna take [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5141.4s)]
*  14 million people off their healthcare. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5143.639999999999s)]
*  We're not only gonna protect healthcare [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5145.639999999999s)]
*  because I think protecting healthcare is not enough. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5147.12s)]
*  We need to invest in cures. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5149.48s)]
*  Cures are firing cancer doctors. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5151.92s)]
*  So we have a real clean contrast. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5153.72s)]
*  We're for cures, they're for cancer, right? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5156.56s)]
*  So that's why you should trust us [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5159.320000000001s)]
*  because 40% of Americans are gonna get a phone call [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5161.2s)]
*  from a doctor to say, I'm sorry, you have cancer. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5164.12s)]
*  And so you're gonna, if it doesn't come to you, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5167.4400000000005s)]
*  it's gonna come to someone you know. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5169.400000000001s)]
*  And so you want the party that believes in your healthcare [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5171.04s)]
*  and that you have a right to fight it and not go broke. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5175.04s)]
*  And I think we have a chance to do that. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5178.16s)]
*  You think, well, I know Democrats do have [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5179.88s)]
*  a messaging problem because it's almost like Democrats [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5182.56s)]
*  love facts and figures, but Republicans talk to people's [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5184.72s)]
*  gut, their emotion. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5188.6s)]
*  When will y'all learn to hit back emotionally? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5189.68s)]
*  We think messaging is winning a Harvard Law School [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5191.6s)]
*  moot court competition. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5195.64s)]
*  And I think messaging is winning a gut check [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5198.2s)]
*  at the bar or the bus stop. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5202.36s)]
*  And so it means just speaking plainly. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5204.4800000000005s)]
*  And when you see the other side elect a 34 count felon, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5208.52s)]
*  you should probably see yourself as liberated [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5214.08s)]
*  to just say what you believe and not be so polished [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5216.400000000001s)]
*  and scripted and try and project what you think [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5219.76s)]
*  a politician should sound like. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5221.88s)]
*  Cause people can call bull. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5223.64s)]
*  And they're calling bull. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5225.08s)]
*  And so I hope what you're seeing now is more and more [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5226.160000000001s)]
*  of my colleagues liberated. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5229.400000000001s)]
*  Can it produce some cringe moments? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5231.360000000001s)]
*  Yes, but the other part of this is to always be on. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5233.4800000000005s)]
*  Cause if you're not always on, you're gonna get defined. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5236.6s)]
*  And this happened to us in the last election on issues [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5238.64s)]
*  that we weren't talking about that much, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5241.320000000001s)]
*  but they would define and exaggerate. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5243.400000000001s)]
*  And then we found ourselves on defense [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5245.8s)]
*  cause we were too scripted and we were too cautious. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5247.240000000001s)]
*  Is there anything Democrats can do to stop the GOP mega vote? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5249.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes, continue to go to Republican districts [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5252.6s)]
*  and put pressure on. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5255.76s)]
*  I'm getting 700 to a thousand people in these districts [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5256.6s)]
*  when I go and do town halls. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5259.360000000001s)]
*  And that downward pressure, we only need to flip [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5260.96s)]
*  three of them in the house. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5263.92s)]
*  If it comes back again, same thing in the Senate. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5265.88s)]
*  And we have Senate seats that we did not think were in play [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5268.360000000001s)]
*  that are gonna be in play. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5270.68s)]
*  Not just North Carolina, but also Florida, Iowa. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5271.68s)]
*  I mean, look at the Senator of Iowa. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5275.64s)]
*  Two weeks ago, you would not have said that Iowa [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5276.88s)]
*  was gonna be a threat. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5279.320000000001s)]
*  And then the Senator of Iowa went out and said, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5280.160000000001s)]
*  well, who cares if we're cutting Medicaid? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5282.160000000001s)]
*  We're all gonna die anyway. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5284.280000000001s)]
*  So like going to those States, doing these town halls, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5285.320000000001s)]
*  bringing out not just Democrats, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5288.68s)]
*  but Republicans and independents, that works. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5290.0s)]
*  And it's also an organizing tool, a muscle for us, [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5292.240000000001s)]
*  to exercise so that we're ready to flex it [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5296.16s)]
*  at the midterms next November. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5297.88s)]
*  Is your Democrats who support this bill be shamed? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5299.08s)]
*  No Democrats who support this bill. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5302.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5303.4s)]
*  Yeah, do not support this bill. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5304.24s)]
*  Is this the same bill that Chuck Schumer said [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5306.28s)]
*  he wanted to support, right? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5308.5599999999995s)]
*  No, no, no. That was a spending bill. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5309.799999999999s)]
*  That was a spending bill, yeah. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5311.24s)]
*  And that's gonna come back up in September. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5312.08s)]
*  I hope we learned our lesson from what happened in March. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5313.5199999999995s)]
*  That we should not be helping these guys get well. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5316.48s)]
*  Because as I said, they're firing cancer doctors. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5319.719999999999s)]
*  That's when you fund their government, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5321.759999999999s)]
*  you're funding a government that is firing cancer doctors. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5323.36s)]
*  Are they really cutting Medicaid? [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5325.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5326.96s)]
*  So they say they're not. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5327.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, they say a lot of that they're actually doing. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5328.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, we don't reach a bill, so I don't know. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5330.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, they're really cutting Medicaid. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5331.96s)]
*  It's really in it, they wanna cut Medicaid. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5332.799999999999s)]
*  Yes, it will kick 14 million people off Medicaid. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5334.48s)]
*  Wow. 14 million people. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5337.679999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5339.04s)]
*  Well, Congressman Eric Falwell, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5339.88s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5341.28s)]
*  And don't be a stranger. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5343.12s)]
*  I'll be back. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5343.96s)]
*  All right, it's the Breakfast Club, good morning. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5344.84s)]

*  Lauren becoming a straight face. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5354.88s)]
*  Tell us, man! [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5356.8s)]
*  She gets into somebody that knows somebody. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5358.12s)]
*  She gets the details. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5359.92s)]
*  I'm the homegirl that knows a little bit about everything. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5361.32s)]
*  Everybody. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5363.92s)]
*  She be having the latest on this. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5364.759999999999s)]
*  The sound of things. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5366.08s)]
*  The latest. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5366.92s)]
*  The latest with Lauren LaRosa. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5367.759999999999s)]
*  Sometimes she have facts, sometimes she have details, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5369.36s)]
*  sometimes she have a little bit of everything. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5371.36s)]
*  Well, it's the latest. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5372.8s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5373.639999999999s)]
*  Talk to me, man. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5374.88s)]
*  Breakfast Club. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5376.76s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5377.56s)]
*  Well, in case anybody was wondering, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5379.240000000001s)]
*  Vanessa Bryant is not pregnant. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5380.76s)]
*  So Vanessa Bryant had to go to her Insta story [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5383.92s)]
*  and post to clear up rumors. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5387.4400000000005s)]
*  There have been things, I guess, spreading online. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5389.84s)]
*  I didn't even see the rumors. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5392.280000000001s)]
*  I just saw her post about it. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5393.56s)]
*  I didn't see the rumors either. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5394.84s)]
*  Yeah, and I was actually confused [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5395.84s)]
*  because I saw the Insta story in real time [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5397.400000000001s)]
*  when she posted it on her Insta story. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5398.96s)]
*  And I'm like, why is she posting that? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5400.4800000000005s)]
*  She doesn't, like, it threw me off. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5401.84s)]
*  But yeah, so she posted the meme of Rihanna [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5404.2s)]
*  where Rihanna's like swimming and she has the goggles on [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5407.0s)]
*  and she has a little finger up. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5408.92s)]
*  And the caption of the meme said, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5410.2s)]
*  me protecting my peace, not pregnant, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5411.679999999999s)]
*  and having a fun all summer. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5413.639999999999s)]
*  And then she posted another meme, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5415.4s)]
*  another Rihanna meme that says, I'm not mean, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5416.88s)]
*  I'm just not the one. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5418.96s)]
*  So there was enough going around online [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5420.16s)]
*  that I assumed that she had to tell people [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5422.08s)]
*  that she is not pregnant. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5425.08s)]
*  Please leave that lady alone. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5426.04s)]
*  But Kobe passed away in 2020, right? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5427.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5428.8s)]
*  So if she's dating or she's seeing somebody, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5429.639999999999s)]
*  that's her business. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5431.28s)]
*  That's nobody's business. Exactly. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5432.12s)]
*  But her and her family. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5432.96s)]
*  So please leave her alone. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5434.360000000001s)]
*  Regardless of what she is doing, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5435.2s)]
*  she should not have to say anything about anything at all. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5436.320000000001s)]
*  Like she, yes. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5439.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, she really didn't have to. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5441.320000000001s)]
*  She didn't have to, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5442.52s)]
*  but I think it bothered her enough that she felt like she did, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5443.360000000001s)]
*  especially because she's so protective over, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5445.360000000001s)]
*  like Kobe's legacy and all these things. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5447.28s)]
*  I think- [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5449.12s)]
*  The girls, of course. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5449.96s)]
*  Yeah, and her daughters. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5450.8s)]
*  And it's just- [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5451.64s)]
*  By the way, your algorithm is not the world. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5452.4800000000005s)]
*  Like just cause people are tweeting you something [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5454.0s)]
*  or sending you stuff, don't mean that everybody saw it. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5455.88s)]
*  Cause I didn't, I didn't, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5458.56s)]
*  that's the first time I'm hearing any of this. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5459.400000000001s)]
*  But it probably bothered her. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5460.8s)]
*  I figured it bothered her because she does not [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5462.52s)]
*  normally address things of that nature, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5464.200000000001s)]

*  But yes. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5468.240000000001s)]

*  When people say that you pregnant and you not pregnant. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5473.68s)]

*  What happened with Shola? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5551.4800000000005s)]
*  What happened? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5552.320000000001s)]
*  So this story is a couple of days old, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5553.72s)]
*  but people were still arguing about it. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5555.96s)]
*  So I figured let's jump on into the argument. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5557.160000000001s)]
*  So Tinder, the dating app, now has a feature. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5558.92s)]
*  It's a hype feature to help people date more intentionally. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5562.08s)]
*  So a spokesperson for Tinder came out [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5565.4800000000005s)]
*  and talked about the fact that they, you know, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5567.64s)]
*  they want to help their users be more intentional, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5569.280000000001s)]
*  especially navigating the algorithm on these dating apps, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5572.04s)]
*  because a lot of times, no matter, you know, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5574.84s)]
*  who you're responding to, what your preferences are, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5576.64s)]
*  it's taking you to people that you don't want to date. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5578.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't know the height. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5580.08s)]
*  You don't. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5581.04s)]
*  A lot of short men on Tinder. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5581.88s)]
*  Go ahead, break it down. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5582.96s)]

*  So if you have a platinum level of Tinder, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5585.28s)]

*  And I actually made a Tinder account [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5605.88s)]
*  cause I was trying to see what this was like. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5607.12s)]

*  They gave me like 10 different options of woman. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5616.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5618.759999999999s)]
*  So you, you, you, you, that's where you going now? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5619.599999999999s)]
*  No, they asked me my, like, am I a man or a woman? [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5621.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, I thought you said your preference and you said woman. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5625.44s)]

*  So then they give you the selection of heights. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5630.759999999999s)]
*  How tall is your daddy? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5632.96s)]
*  They can give you, oh, he's like 6'3". [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5634.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5636.28s)]
*  You could never. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5637.12s)]
*  She got a big father. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5637.96s)]
*  Yes, big father. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5639.24s)]
*  This is nasty. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5640.52s)]
*  Not a little quark. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5641.36s)]
*  Nasty, yeah, continue on. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5642.2s)]
*  All right, so then it goes from height to any height. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5643.16s)]
*  So you can have taller or shorter. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5646.24s)]
*  But you know, people are seeing that this whole height thing [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5648.72s)]
*  and putting this preference in is heightism [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5651.68s)]
*  and height supremacy. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5654.76s)]
*  And I looked up heightism. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5656.56s)]
*  Did you know that is a thing? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5657.96s)]
*  No, but continue. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5659.12s)]
*  I'm gonna let you cook. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5659.96s)]
*  Keep going. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5660.8s)]
*  Heightism is the prejudice or discrimination [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5661.64s)]
*  against someone on the basis of their height. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5663.16s)]
*  I did not know that these were real things, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5664.96s)]
*  but the people are upset at Tinder. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5666.48s)]
*  So short man can't get no dates. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5668.28s)]
*  This is what all the short kings out there. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5669.12s)]
*  Here's the thing, my brothers. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5670.719999999999s)]
*  When you a short king, just understand [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5672.12s)]

*  shouldn't be a determining factor in dating apps [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5746.92s)]
*  because that's a badly styled or poorly maintained wig [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnfvXvji7wA&t=5748.84s)]
