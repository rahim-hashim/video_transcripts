*  Did your grandmothers ever tell you all right, because I'm trying to figure out if I should do this tonight, put a little bit of cognac on a rag and then slide across her gums. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=75.92s)]
*  My grandmother never said that but I've heard that before. But I don't know if you should do that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=85.92s)]

*  What up Morgan? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=184.92s)]
*  Hey y'all. Hey how you feeling? Good. Good morning. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=185.92s)]
*  I love to hear it. OK. Let's get into it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=189.92s)]
*  First on front page. Elon Musk is still slamming President Trump's so-called one big beautiful bill saying it needs to be killed. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=191.92s)]
*  In a post on X Musk said a spending bill should be drafted that doesn't massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by five trillion dollars. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=198.92s)]
*  In a later post he urged Americans to call their senators and congressmen saying bankrupting America is not OK. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=208.92s)]
*  Kill the bill. Now Musk has been critically highly critically of the spending bill in days since ending his work with Doge as a special government employee for the White House. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=214.92s)]
*  On Tuesday he called it a disgusting abomination. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=225.92s)]
*  Meanwhile the House Speaker Mike Johnson says Elon Musk has ghosted his calls and him over President Trump's so-called one big beautiful bill. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=228.92s)]
*  And he calls Musk's recent comments very disappointing as he continues to tout the bill. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=236.92s)]
*  Now Speaker Johnson spoke to the media saying he called Musk following his recent comments but Elon didn't answer. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=241.92s)]
*  And he went on to say that he spoke to President Trump who's not too delighted about Elon's current stance on this big beautiful bill. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=247.92s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Speaker Johnson. House Speaker Mike Johnson. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=255.92s)]
*  Well I'll tell you I called Elon last night and he didn't answer. I don't know what happened in 24 hours. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  I don't know. Everybody can draw their own conclusions about that. OK. But I look forward to talking to my friend about it again. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=262.92s)]
*  And obviously we've talked about this. As you know he's not he's not delighted that Elon did a 180 on that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=267.92s)]
*  So Musk has since posted bankrupting America is not OK. Again kill the bill. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=275.92s)]
*  And the Congressional Budget Office reports the legislation would add a 2.4 trillion dollar to the nation's deficit over the next decade. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=281.92s)]
*  And the bill can only afford to lose three of three GOP votes in the Senate which is happening right now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=289.92s)]
*  The Senate is taking up this bill as as the session has begun. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=295.92s)]
*  Now elsewhere Capitol Hill lawmakers are coming together in opposition. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=300.92s)]
*  Hold on Morgan. I want to say something right. Well this criticism. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=304.92s)]
*  Yeah this criticism from Elon is one of two things. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=309.92s)]
*  Either Elon said look I paid damn near 300 million dollars for this presidency. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=312.92s)]
*  So I have paid the cost. I have paid the cost to be the boss literally so I can criticize the president and this bill. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=317.92s)]
*  And if your job you know as the head of Doge was to find waste in government and then you see a bill that's wasteful you have to call it out. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=323.92s)]
*  Correct. But this also could just be a way for Elon to rehabilitate his image and get his companies back on track. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=330.92s)]
*  So they're all in on it. Hey I'm a criticize this bill. I'm a criticize you. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=337.92s)]
*  You know you're leaving our administration to get back to work. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=341.92s)]
*  We know that your companies took a hit. So we're going to let you you know criticize us to rehabilitate your image. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=344.92s)]
*  I will believe all of this when Trump cancels one of Elon Musk government contracts with SpaceX because you know that's how he plays. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=349.92s)]
*  That's how you play. Yeah you're right. That's that's true. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=356.92s)]
*  That's true. If somebody around him is really criticizing him and you know he's going to punish them in some way. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=359.92s)]
*  I believe it when Trump cancels one of Elon Musk contracts with SpaceX. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=364.92s)]
*  Elon is already filling it in with Tesla. So you know to your point that both points are good and valid elsewhere. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=367.92s)]
*  Capitol Hill lawmakers are coming together in opposition of a 10 year ban on a regulations which is a part of also a part of Trump's so-called big beautiful bill. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=374.92s)]
*  Now Georgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=382.92s)]
*  You may know her as a bleach bomb built bad bills body. Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=385.92s)]
*  She says it violates states rights and California Democrat Ted Lew. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=388.92s)]
*  He tends to agree adding that banning states from putting guardrails on AI would cause unnecessary harm. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=393.92s)]
*  Let's take a listen to California Democrat Ted Lew's comments. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=398.92s)]
*  I agree with Marjorie Taylor Green once every hundred years. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=402.92s)]
*  This is that time. I agree that this 10 year provision is extreme. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=405.92s)]
*  It's going to cause unnecessary harm. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=409.92s)]
*  This is a bad provision and I hope the Senate will take out this 10 year moratorium. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=412.92s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Green pretty much said that you know that she doesn't agree with it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=419.92s)]
*  And you know people came for her saying you had one job just to read the bill. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=423.92s)]
*  But she basically said the same thing that you know there's no telling what can happen in 10 years with a I said Lew. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=426.92s)]
*  He wants the Senate to strip out the provision. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=432.92s)]
*  If it stays in there Green says she won't vote for it for when the bill comes back for a vote and that could doom the whole package. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=434.92s)]
*  Thanks to the slim margins in the House. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=442.92s)]
*  Again they can only afford the Senate Republicans can only afford three votes no votes in against this bill. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=443.92s)]
*  There have to be some type of regulations on AI. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=451.92s)]
*  Yeah absolutely. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=454.92s)]
*  We just like you know I'll be watching so many AI videos and I'll be just like wow. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=455.92s)]
*  I mean at this point it's hard to tell what's real and what's you know what's AI. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=460.92s)]
*  And there definitely needs to be some regulations on that for sure. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=464.92s)]
*  Republican senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee also back must criticism while Republican Congresswoman as I mentioned Marjorie Taylor Green expressed regret for voting yes on the measure. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=468.92s)]
*  Senate Republicans as I mentioned before can only afford three no votes to get the measure passed. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=477.92s)]
*  They're looking at July 4th as a projected deadline to get that bill on Trump's desk. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=481.92s)]
*  So I'll keep you guys posted on this one big beautiful bill and what and how it continues to move. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=487.92s)]
*  Well thank you Morgan. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=493.92s)]

*  It's Steve from the Bronx. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=603.92s)]
*  Steve from the Bronx. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=604.92s)]
*  Steve from the Bronx. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=605.92s)]
*  Steve from the Bronx. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=606.92s)]
*  What up? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=607.92s)]
*  Get it off your chest Steve. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=608.92s)]
*  Yeah yeah y'all was talking about the big beautiful bill at Elon Musk. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=609.92s)]
*  Yes sir. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=612.92s)]
*  Yeah the reason he's opposing it is because it's killing the EV industry. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=613.92s)]
*  In the bill it kills the tax rebate and also it's going to make people with an EV pay 250 [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=617.92s)]
*  a year just to drive EVs. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=624.92s)]
*  So that's why he's opposing the bill. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=626.92s)]
*  Oh okay. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=628.92s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=629.92s)]
*  Y'all ever heard of Brian Tyler Cohen? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=630.92s)]
*  Y'all ever heard of him? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=631.92s)]
*  Yeah I heard of Brian Tyler Cohen. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=632.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=633.92s)]
*  Yeah y'all gotta have him on the show. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=635.92s)]
*  He just did a video yesterday explaining why Elon Musk was going in on the bill. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=636.92s)]
*  I think that's another good reason. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=639.92s)]
*  I also think that he's trying to rehabilitate his image though just so he can get his companies [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=642.92s)]
*  back on track. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=646.92s)]
*  Yeah but if this whole thing is EV and he's taking shots at EV. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=647.92s)]
*  Definitely he's going to lose a bunch of money if they pass it though. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=650.92s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=652.92s)]
*  Yeah because he already lost a bunch of money just being the head of Doge and firing a bunch [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=653.92s)]
*  of people like so. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=658.92s)]
*  There's a lot of people who already turned their back on the bill. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=659.92s)]
*  You see his stock prices dropping crazy. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=661.92s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=662.92s)]
*  Alright brother have a good one. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=663.92s)]
*  I think they say Elon lost like a hundred billion dollars being a part of those. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=664.92s)]
*  I can imagine. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=665.92s)]
*  Hello? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=666.92s)]

*  if I'm going today [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=880.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not over it I'm just picking and choosing [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=882.84s)]
*  because there's a lot that goes down [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=884.84s)]
*  this week has been kind of wack [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=886.84s)]
*  once you go from the Cassie's [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=888.84s)]
*  and the Kid Cuddy's [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=890.84s)]
*  it's still interesting [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=892.84s)]
*  the night fight yesterday [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=894.84s)]
*  I mean but all these stories we've heard [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=896.84s)]
*  Cassie and Diddy in a night fight? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=898.84s)]
*  yes and then he hung the best [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=900.84s)]
*  he hung the best friend on the balcony [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=902.84s)]
*  yesterday the girl who testified was the friend on the balcony [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=904.84s)]
*  so these are stories we heard [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=906.84s)]
*  but now they're bringing the people in themselves [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=908.84s)]
*  to speak to it [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=911.48s)]
*  it feels like it's been [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=913.48s)]
*  well at least to me just watching it feels like it's been a week [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=915.48s)]
*  for the prosecution [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=917.48s)]
*  but I don't see the defense [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=919.48s)]
*  doing anything strong either [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=921.48s)]
*  I think because the defense they do [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=923.48s)]
*  they cross they do what they do [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=925.48s)]
*  but after this they're waiting to present their case [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=927.48s)]
*  the government has already said that they're going to rest their case early [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=929.48s)]
*  so I think if I'm the defense right now [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=931.48s)]
*  I'm just ramping up my case [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=933.48s)]
*  and already outlets have begun to talk more about [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=935.48s)]
*  who the defense will bring on as witnesses [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=937.48s)]
*  versus a little bit less about what's happening [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=940.12s)]
*  besides like basic recaps [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=942.12s)]
*  yeah but like Sharla said you don't want to be fatigued because you're a juror out there [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=944.12s)]
*  and you might get to the point where you're just tired of hearing the same old stuff [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=946.12s)]
*  over and over and over again [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=948.12s)]
*  I don't know why this is my first time [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=950.12s)]
*  going actually into the court [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=952.12s)]
*  even though I've reported on other cases [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=954.12s)]
*  but I think it's just a thing of [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=956.12s)]
*  they want to any [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=958.12s)]
*  because sometimes the bigger witnesses will mention these stories [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=960.12s)]
*  but they don't fill in small context details [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=962.12s)]
*  and then the actual person themselves comes in [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=964.12s)]
*  and fills in things like [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=966.12s)]
*  that we maybe didn't know or like little small details [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=968.76s)]
*  so they just want to make sure again [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=970.76s)]
*  there's no doubt whatsoever [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=972.76s)]
*  I want you to add in the latest because I know it's that bad [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=974.76s)]
*  yeah in the latest we are going to be talking about [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=976.76s)]
*  unfortunately we're going to be talking about [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=978.76s)]
*  DDG and Halle Bailey again [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=980.76s)]
*  because DDG is asking [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=982.76s)]
*  a judge to stop her from taking [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=984.76s)]
*  their son out of the country because he's saying [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=986.76s)]
*  she's emotionally unstable, suicidal [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=988.76s)]
*  and a danger to their son's safety allegedly [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=990.76s)]
*  did you see this stuff? You want to talk about the text messages or whatever right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=992.76s)]
*  yes, yep we got the docs [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=994.76s)]

*  Halle out of the country for work [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1050.0400000000002s)]
*  because he says she's emotionally unstable [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1052.0400000000002s)]
*  suicidal and is a danger to their son's safety [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1054.68s)]

*  she was allegedly threatening to kill herself [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1097.3200000000002s)]
*  and suggesting that their son might be harmed as well [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1099.3200000000002s)]
*  he says during this time [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1101.3200000000002s)]
*  she was actually driving a car [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1103.3200000000002s)]
*  and he alleges that he was so scared for her safety [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1105.3200000000002s)]
*  because she had done or alleged [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1107.3200000000002s)]
*  and said she would do things like this to herself before [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  and he actually called her godmother [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1111.96s)]
*  because he was worried that their child would be in danger [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1113.96s)]
*  and that she was in danger because of the emotional state [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1115.96s)]
*  that she was in while driving [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1117.96s)]
*  there's also an incident that he talks about [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1119.96s)]
*  August 2023 [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1121.96s)]
*  they got into an argument of some sort [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1123.96s)]
*  and after the argument [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1125.96s)]
*  he alleges that Halle took his legal gun [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1127.96s)]
*  and left their home [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1129.96s)]
*  and he got scared again for her safety [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1131.96s)]
*  and he called his mom [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1133.96s)]
*  and his mother's fiance [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1135.96s)]
*  because he couldn't find her [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1137.96s)]
*  and his mom came [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1140.6000000000001s)]
*  they found her outside of the home [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1142.6000000000001s)]
*  allegedly still holding the gun [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1144.6000000000001s)]
*  and she was emotionally unwell [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1146.6000000000001s)]
*  and incoherent and potentially suicidal then [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1148.6000000000001s)]
*  and then there is an additional time [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1150.6000000000001s)]
*  March 22nd [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1152.6000000000001s)]
*  that he alleges in Atlanta [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1154.6000000000001s)]
*  he says that this was the first time that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1156.6000000000001s)]
*  Halle threatened to harm herself with a knife [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1158.6000000000001s)]
*  she was texting and calling him repeatedly [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1160.6000000000001s)]
*  and I do have some of the screenshots [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1162.6000000000001s)]
*  from the document [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  so in one text [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1166.6000000000001s)]
*  if this is her [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1169.24s)]
*  these are alleged texts [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1171.24s)]
*  she's saying it's all his fault [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1173.24s)]
*  she's saying cry about it later [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1175.24s)]
*  and this is after she would have threatened to harm herself [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1177.24s)]
*  and not live anymore [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1179.24s)]
*  and that's a repeated cycle in these texts that he's included [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1181.24s)]
*  and he's responding and saying [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1183.24s)]
*  why do you want me to sit on the phone and listen to you [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1185.24s)]
*  yell at me all day, you do this to me every day [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1187.24s)]
*  and she says I beg for your help [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1189.24s)]
*  you know I don't have anyone [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1191.24s)]
*  I'm actively suicidal and struggling [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1193.24s)]
*  you know I've been running to the doctor every day for help [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1195.24s)]
*  and you still play in my face [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1197.88s)]
*  I won't make it to my birthday because of you [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1199.88s)]
*  so this is just an example of some of the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1201.88s)]
*  type of texts I can't hear myself [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1203.88s)]
*  some of the type of texts that were included [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1205.88s)]
*  in this document [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1207.88s)]
*  now Halle has responded [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1209.88s)]
*  and she's actually responded [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1211.88s)]
*  Halle [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1213.88s)]
*  I can't hear [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1215.88s)]
*  my headphones not up [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1217.88s)]
*  show them it was the same problem this morning [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1219.88s)]
*  it's here [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1221.88s)]
*  first of all it was up, it was the thing [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1223.88s)]
*  Halle [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1226.5200000000002s)]
*  so Halle [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1228.5200000000002s)]
*  my great-grandmother's name is Halle [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1230.5200000000002s)]
*  so Halle has responded [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1232.5200000000002s)]
*  and in her response she basically is saying [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1234.5200000000002s)]
*  that it's ironic that he's just now waiting to respond [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1236.5200000000002s)]
*  she's saying that she should be granted permission [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1238.5200000000002s)]
*  because she has to go and work, she has to make money for her child [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1240.5200000000002s)]
*  and she also did directly [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1242.5200000000002s)]
*  address the mental health things [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1244.5200000000002s)]
*  and she says [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1246.5200000000002s)]
*  that she alleges that DDG is exaggerating [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1248.5200000000002s)]
*  lying and misconstruing [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1250.5200000000002s)]
*  facts for the court not only to make [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1252.5200000000002s)]
*  their relationship look crazy [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1255.16s)]
*  but to make her parenting and her mental health [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1257.16s)]
*  look away as well [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1259.16s)]
*  she says there's no doubt that I was emotionally [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1261.16s)]
*  devastated in 2022 and in 2023 [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1263.16s)]
*  by his behavior and ongoing abuse [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1265.16s)]
*  that she alleges [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1267.16s)]
*  I have been very vocal about my anxiety, depression [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1269.16s)]
*  and previous thoughts of suicide [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1271.16s)]
*  without waiving the rights of her therapist [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1273.16s)]
*  and her privilege [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1275.16s)]
*  she says she has reached out to her doctor to receive [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1277.16s)]
*  treatment and to address these issues [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1279.16s)]
*  and she also says that if given a chance [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1281.16s)]
*  she'll take the stand and talk about all these things [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1283.8000000000002s)]
*  and she has nothing to hide [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1285.8000000000002s)]
*  but it's unfair that he's right now [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1287.8000000000002s)]
*  requesting for her to not be able to take [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1289.8000000000002s)]
*  the child out of the country [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1291.8000000000002s)]
*  and the reason why he's saying that he doesn't want the child [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1293.8000000000002s)]
*  to go out of the country is number one of course [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1295.8000000000002s)]
*  all the mental health stuff that he's alleging is harmful [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1297.8000000000002s)]
*  but he's also saying that if [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1299.8000000000002s)]
*  baby Halo goes out of the country [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1301.8000000000002s)]
*  and god forbid something were to happen [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1303.8000000000002s)]
*  like she goes into a mental state allegedly [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1305.8000000000002s)]
*  or she's threatening to harm the baby [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1307.8000000000002s)]
*  they're out of the court's jurisdiction [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1309.8000000000002s)]
*  and it could take weeks, days or whatever [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1312.44s)]
*  before he could [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1314.44s)]
*  so imagine struggling with all those issues [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1316.44s)]
*  and Jess you can speak to this [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1318.44s)]
*  postpartum depression is real as well [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1320.44s)]
*  absolutely it is [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1322.44s)]
*  you don't know what your days are going to be like [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1324.44s)]
*  you wake up, you're sad, you're constantly sad [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1326.44s)]
*  and all you want is a break from the baby [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1328.44s)]
*  and thank god that I did have breaks [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1330.44s)]
*  but it seems like even in those messages [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1332.44s)]
*  she's asking him [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1334.44s)]
*  begging him practically [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1336.44s)]
*  like yo I need you [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1338.44s)]

*  with postpartum depression [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1343.0800000000002s)]
*  as a man and N.V. you know [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1347.0800000000002s)]

*  yeah but that's what I think that he's saying [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1361.0800000000002s)]
*  and he's saying if this happens while she's [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1363.0800000000002s)]
*  overseas taping who's there to help [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1365.0800000000002s)]

*  yeah and he's saying he like [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1373.72s)]

*  the messages reflect that she said you know I have nobody [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1377.72s)]

*  is this public record [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1387.72s)]

*  publicly on the Pacer [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1391.72s)]

*  I had to do other things [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1395.72s)]
*  so I'm not for sure [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1398.3600000000001s)]
*  TMZ broke the story exclusively [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1400.3600000000001s)]
*  and I don't know because I don't work there anymore [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1402.3600000000001s)]
*  so I don't know how these outlets [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1404.3600000000001s)]
*  because the text messages were in the actual docs [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1406.3600000000001s)]
*  so if you got the docs [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1408.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't see that he posted it [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1410.3600000000001s)]

*  get on a stream after [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1414.3600000000001s)]
*  and he said in the beginning of the stream [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1416.3600000000001s)]
*  we're gonna have positivity here [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1418.3600000000001s)]

*  but I mean when you include stuff like this [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1422.3600000000001s)]
*  in documents whether it's [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1424.3600000000001s)]
*  I can't answer the question 100% if it's publicly available or not [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1427.0s)]
*  wasn't available to me but it's here [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1429.0s)]
*  so any outlet can grab it and I will circulate it [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1431.0s)]
*  and I really hate that I hate the fact that [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1433.0s)]
*  a couple can go through something and they have these [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1435.0s)]
*  documents and these text messages that are private [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1437.0s)]

*  they are working it out as a couple that separate [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1455.64s)]
*  especially if you're trying to heal privately [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1457.64s)]
*  you gotta heal privately but live out loud publicly [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1459.64s)]
*  I wouldn't wish that on nobody [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1461.64s)]

*  about her time in [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1760.0400000000002s)]
*  Biden's White House, let's take a listen [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1762.0400000000002s)]
*  this book, Independent, it's about [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1764.0400000000002s)]
*  looking outside of boxes [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1766.0400000000002s)]
*  not just always being [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1768.0400000000002s)]
*  a partisan stance [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1770.04s)]
*  and how do we move forward [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1772.04s)]
*  together in a compassionate [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1774.04s)]
*  way? I think we need [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1776.04s)]
*  to stop thinking in boxes [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1778.04s)]
*  and think outside of our [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1780.04s)]
*  boxes and not be so [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1782.04s)]
*  partisan. So the publisher says [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1784.04s)]
*  Jean-Pierre will take readers through [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1786.04s)]
*  the three weeks that led to Biden's [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1788.04s)]
*  abandoning his bid for a second [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1790.04s)]
*  term and the betrayal by the [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1792.04s)]
*  Democratic Party that led to his decision [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1794.04s)]
*  now Jean-Pierre of course served as [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1796.04s)]
*  White House Press Secretary under the Biden [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1798.04s)]
*  administration from May 2022 until [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1800.04s)]
*  the end of his presidency in January [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1802.04s)]
*  Independent will hit shelves [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1804.04s)]
*  on October 21st [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1806.04s)]
*  Any thoughts on Jean-Pierre [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1808.04s)]
*  switching parties? Let's discuss [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1810.04s)]
*  well she didn't switch parties, she's independent now [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1812.04s)]
*  right so I respect [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1814.04s)]
*  her being independent because I feel like if you black [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1816.04s)]
*  in this country you shouldn't be loyal to any party [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1818.04s)]
*  you should only be voting your interests, you should only [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1820.04s)]
*  be voting for politicians who are implementing [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1822.04s)]
*  legislation and policies for [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1824.04s)]
*  your communities and your people and if you ask [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1826.04s)]
*  me none of these parties have done enough for [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1828.04s)]
*  us to be screaming we Republican, our Democrats [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1830.04s)]
*  so Independent is the way to go but [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1832.04s)]
*  when it comes to her in particular [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1834.04s)]
*  I'm probably going to read the book but nobody [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1836.04s)]
*  wants to hear from anyone who got up there and lied [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1838.04s)]
*  for the Biden administration. It's like [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1840.04s)]
*  a lot of these folks are having to come to Jesus' moment [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1842.04s)]
*  way too late, they should have been [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1844.04s)]
*  talking like this two or three years [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1846.04s)]
*  ago and she had a very interesting quote [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1848.04s)]
*  in her press release, the quote was [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1850.04s)]
*  we need to be willing to exercise the ability [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1852.04s)]
*  to think creatively and plan strategically [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1854.04s)]
*  we need to be clear eyed and questioning [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1856.04s)]
*  rather than blindly loyal and [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1858.04s)]
*  obedient as we may have been [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1860.04s)]
*  in the past and that right there is [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1862.04s)]
*  the problem with Democrat supporters [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1864.04s)]
*  especially black ones, just blindly [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1866.04s)]
*  loyal and obedient [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1868.04s)]
*  for no damn reason. I got a [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1870.04s)]
*  follow up question regarding that quote [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1872.04s)]
*  do you think that that is, that she's [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1874.04s)]
*  in terms of her loyalty [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1876.04s)]
*  do you think that she's saying that she's being loyal [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1878.04s)]
*  to Biden as the president [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1880.04s)]
*  or loyal to the office [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1882.04s)]
*  as being a press secretary for [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1884.04s)]
*  the White House, is there a difference in being [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1886.04s)]
*  loyal to the White House, the office [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1888.04s)]
*  or being loyal to President Biden as a person? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1890.04s)]
*  You can't be loyal to [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1892.04s)]
*  either when being loyal to [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1894.04s)]
*  them would be a detriment to your country [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1896.04s)]
*  and based off the condition that [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1898.04s)]
*  President Joe Biden was in and she [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1900.04s)]
*  was somebody that was around him all the time [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1902.04s)]
*  I feel like it was their duty [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1904.04s)]
*  to tell the American people what was going [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1906.04s)]
*  on and they didn't, even though we all had [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1908.04s)]
*  eyes and we all had ears and we saw it for ourselves [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1910.04s)]
*  but they were the ones that were up close [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1912.04s)]
*  and personal with him all the time [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1914.04s)]
*  and they all were in on the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1916.04s)]
*  conspiracy to hide his [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1918.04s)]
*  physical and mental condition from [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1920.04s)]
*  America and that's why they lost [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1922.04s)]
*  the election. Well one of the many reasons [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1924.04s)]

*  My energy is better. You know I've been going through a lot. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1984.04s)]
*  But I feel like [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1986.04s)]
*  where y'all have seen me for the past what, two years [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1988.04s)]
*  I'm definitely [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1990.04s)]
*  in a more healed place. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1992.04s)]
*  When did you get to that place? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1994.04s)]
*  Actually working on my album [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1996.04s)]
*  was like my therapy. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=1998.04s)]
*  So I think that just being able to get all of those [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2000.04s)]
*  emotions out and just [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2002.04s)]
*  do something productive and then put it [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2004.04s)]
*  all on paper and leave it there. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2006.04s)]
*  That was a big part of [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2008.04s)]
*  my healing journey. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2010.04s)]
*  For people that don't know what y'all [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2012.04s)]
*  talking about, because a lot of people might not watch [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2014.04s)]
*  The Housewives of Atlanta. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2016.04s)]
*  So she was on Housewives of Atlanta and you recently got a divorce, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2018.04s)]
*  a separation. It's not official yet. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2020.04s)]
*  A separation. I'm still going through the process. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2022.04s)]
*  You're not allowed to have a red separation because he lives in a basement [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2024.04s)]
*  and you live upstairs. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2026.04s)]
*  And you're not allowed downstairs. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2028.04s)]
*  And he's been there for some time. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2030.04s)]
*  Yeah, and he's not allowed to come upstairs unless I grant him access. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2032.04s)]
*  It's just like I've never heard of this. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2034.04s)]
*  Like I don't know anybody else that I can say, girl how did you deal with this? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2036.04s)]
*  I've never heard of this and I did not know that would ever be [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2038.04s)]
*  something the judge would rule on. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2040.04s)]
*  So it makes it extra complicated. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2042.04s)]
*  It's already hard enough. Divorce is already tough enough. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2044.04s)]
*  But you know to run into each other [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2046.04s)]
*  in the driveway. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2048.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's a lot. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2050.04s)]
*  How did it even come to that point? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2052.04s)]
*  Who said that this how it should be? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2054.04s)]
*  I've never heard of that. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2056.04s)]
*  Did he say I want to live [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2058.04s)]
*  and I want to remain in the house? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2060.04s)]
*  And how did that happen? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2062.04s)]
*  He was basically like I'm not leaving. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2064.04s)]
*  His attorneys were like yeah he's not going to leave the premises. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2066.04s)]
*  Have you seen the movie World of Roses? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2068.04s)]
*  Thank you. Yeah, right? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2072.04s)]
*  It's like that in real life. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2074.04s)]
*  It's the asset in the marriage. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2076.04s)]
*  What I've been learning through this process is [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2078.04s)]
*  it's all about love and it's like pure bliss [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2080.04s)]
*  and we built this beautiful family [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2082.04s)]
*  and we're building legacy and then [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2084.04s)]
*  all of a sudden we're going through a divorce [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2086.04s)]
*  and now it's all business. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2088.04s)]
*  It's like you know a negotiation of so the asset being the house [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2090.04s)]
*  it's a big deal. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2092.04s)]
*  And so I would love to just split everything. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2094.04s)]
*  Like 50-50. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2096.04s)]
*  Keep it simple. We can be done. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2098.04s)]
*  But he's like I want everything. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2100.04s)]
*  I want the house. I want 40% of your business [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2102.04s)]
*  that I've had since 2005. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2104.04s)]
*  It's my company. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2106.04s)]
*  I'm going to do that. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2108.04s)]
*  How did y'all get there though? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2110.04s)]
*  What started the separation? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2112.04s)]
*  People assumed it was cheating. People assumed it was so many different things. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2114.04s)]
*  How did y'all get there? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2116.04s)]
*  Let's go girl. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2118.04s)]
*  I like when you get your real housewife back. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2120.04s)]
*  I like when you get your real housewife back daddy. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2122.04s)]
*  When you be scrambling and scribbling [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2124.04s)]
*  in your real housewife back. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2126.04s)]
*  I like that daddy. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2128.04s)]
*  So then you watched it. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2130.04s)]
*  Explain to people what happened. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2132.04s)]
*  So we lived in Chicago. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2134.04s)]
*  I'm from Chicago originally. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2136.04s)]
*  Born and raised. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2138.04s)]
*  We lived there for some time. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2140.04s)]
*  It was a lot of women. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2142.04s)]
*  It was a lot of women. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2144.04s)]
*  The whole finding things in your phone. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2146.04s)]
*  I got family. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2148.04s)]
*  Everybody knows we live here. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2150.04s)]
*  People seeing you out sir at dinner with women. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2152.04s)]
*  So it was a lot of that. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2154.04s)]
*  So you went in his phone? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2156.04s)]
*  I did at one point. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2158.04s)]
*  Why can't you let him and his women be? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2160.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2162.04s)]
*  I'm not having a modern man over there [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2164.04s)]
*  I'm talking about. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2166.04s)]
*  I mean dad you still questioning. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2168.04s)]
*  You know why? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2170.04s)]
*  At first I thought it was because he just don't watch the show. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2172.04s)]
*  Then I'm like oh no he trying to get her. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2174.04s)]
*  Aren't you from South Carolina? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2176.04s)]
*  Y'all might be cousins. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2178.04s)]
*  Oh he. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2180.04s)]
*  QG? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2182.04s)]
*  Oh yeah QG. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2184.04s)]
*  Right by Moscona. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2186.04s)]
*  You know he got a lot of cousins. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2188.04s)]
*  You remember Cousin Courtney on the show? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2190.04s)]
*  He don't know Cousin Courtney. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2192.04s)]
*  Oh you just see. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2194.04s)]
*  So that was in Chicago you found her. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2196.04s)]
*  But then you moved to Atlanta and you forgave him? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2198.04s)]
*  I did. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2200.04s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2202.04s)]
*  My parents were married for 60 years until my dad passed away. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2204.04s)]
*  So I grew up in a household where I saw people choose each other every day. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2206.04s)]
*  Fight, make up. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2210.04s)]
*  That was just what I saw. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2212.04s)]
*  So that's what I wanted for myself. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2214.04s)]
*  So when I got married it was like this is what we go through. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2216.04s)]
*  We're going to talk about it, communicate and move forward. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2218.04s)]
*  We moved to Atlanta and he left and went to Tampa for three days. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2220.04s)]
*  Everyone saw that on national TV. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2224.04s)]
*  But it was embarrassing. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2226.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2228.04s)]
*  Like you leave your family and you don't tell us where you went. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2230.04s)]
*  And it was more so because it was public. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2232.04s)]
*  You know and humiliation and embarrassment. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2234.04s)]
*  And I think that was tough. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2236.04s)]
*  That was the last straw? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2238.04s)]
*  That was it for you? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2240.04s)]
*  I mean it was that and it was just the continuous behavior of like dealing with other women. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2242.04s)]
*  And then coming on the show and then there was women saying oh they were pregnant. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2246.04s)]
*  It was a particular woman who reached out and said she was pregnant with his baby. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2248.04s)]
*  And that was a big thing. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2252.04s)]
*  That was probably one of the biggest straws. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2254.04s)]
*  And then it was the disrespect of my mom. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2256.04s)]
*  You know of my family. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2258.04s)]
*  The disrespect of my son Jojo. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2260.04s)]
*  My 14 year old. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2262.04s)]
*  So it was just very layered. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2264.04s)]
*  And finally he moved out of the bedroom. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2266.04s)]
*  So we separated. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2268.04s)]
*  And we were separated at the time. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2270.04s)]
*  So it was a huge separation. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2272.04s)]
*  We were trying to repair things but we were trying to fix things. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2274.04s)]
*  But ultimately it just wasn't able to be repaired. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2276.04s)]
*  And he thought you cheated at one time? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2278.04s)]
*  Well that's what he said. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2280.04s)]
*  You know it was almost like oh she's hanging out and having fun. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2282.04s)]
*  Oh this is my moment. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2284.04s)]
*  And now it flipped to like a victim mentality. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2286.04s)]
*  When that really wasn't what it was. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2288.04s)]
*  And it was pride moment so they thought it was a girl. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2290.04s)]
*  Oh well they thought that before this month. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2292.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2294.04s)]
*  But I heard you talk about it on Carlos King. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2296.04s)]
*  And that was my first time actually hearing you explain it the way you did. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2298.04s)]
*  So he was like oh I'm sorry. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2300.04s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2302.04s)]
*  But he said that you explained it the way you did. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2304.04s)]
*  So he had alleged that you were dating a woman at the time. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2306.04s)]
*  And that's what you were cheating with. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2308.04s)]
*  And you said at the time you were going through so much with him. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2310.04s)]
*  That you would have taken attention from a cardboard box. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2312.04s)]
*  Please talk about that. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2314.04s)]
*  Is it cheating if it's eating? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2316.04s)]
*  What is the matter with you girl? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2318.04s)]
*  Lord. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2320.04s)]
*  Just the comic relief of the situation that you need. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2322.04s)]
*  I mean you know I wouldn't say there was eating. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2324.04s)]
*  You know. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2326.04s)]
*  But I was like oh my god. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2328.04s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2330.04s)]
*  I wouldn't say there was eating. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2332.04s)]
*  You know we were hanging out. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2334.04s)]
*  That's still my girl to this day. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2336.04s)]
*  Like we're still friends. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2338.04s)]
*  But I think it was extra sauce placed on it. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2340.04s)]
*  I will say okay flirting. Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2342.04s)]
*  Like I'll be honest about that. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2344.04s)]
*  A little nibble on some food. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2346.04s)]
*  We went to dinner. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2348.04s)]
*  We was eating at the dinner table. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2350.04s)]
*  But all of the extra stuff. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2352.04s)]
*  I mean you have to really watch the show and know who Ralph is. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2354.04s)]
*  He is very much a narcissist. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2356.04s)]
*  And that's who I married. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2358.04s)]
*  And at the end of the day what happened happened. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2360.04s)]
*  People have actually witnessed it. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2362.04s)]
*  The disrespect. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2364.04s)]
*  So to say okay I'm hanging with this woman. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2366.04s)]
*  And now it's a relationship. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2368.04s)]
*  That just came out of nowhere. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2370.04s)]
*  There was never any evidence. Where's the receipt? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2372.04s)]
*  Like you know people can say things. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2374.04s)]
*  Does it make it true? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2376.04s)]
*  People say things about you. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2378.04s)]
*  Is everything true? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2380.04s)]
*  Not everything. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2382.04s)]
*  How do you balance healing in private when your pain is being monetized on reality TV? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2384.04s)]
*  Honestly you know [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2386.04s)]
*  that time that we did not come right back on the show. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2388.04s)]
*  I was actually grateful because that was the time I took just to self. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2390.04s)]
*  Like I spent my time alone. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2392.04s)]
*  You know I just completely shut down. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2394.04s)]
*  And I did a lot of praying. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2396.04s)]
*  And like I said honestly people may not have understood why I said Dennis was my angel on earth. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2398.04s)]
*  But really it was. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2400.04s)]
*  I was very grateful because it was a blessing at that time to have somewhere to go. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2402.04s)]
*  A lot of times like I didn't want to wake up and get out of bed. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2404.04s)]
*  It's like you just don't feel productive. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2406.04s)]
*  Like overwhelmed. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2408.04s)]
*  Depression is real. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2410.04s)]
*  So I was like okay I'm hanging with this woman. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2412.04s)]
*  And I'm hanging with this woman. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2414.04s)]
*  And depression is real. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2416.04s)]
*  So it was just knowing that I have people supporting me. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2418.04s)]
*  Believing in me. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2420.04s)]
*  And are rooting for me. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2422.04s)]
*  And I had to show up you know for that. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2424.04s)]
*  And when I got to the studio it was like okay I made it. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2426.04s)]
*  And then being able to compile all this body of work. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2428.04s)]
*  And have a productive outlet. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2430.04s)]
*  Like I said it was exactly what I needed to get me to the other side. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2432.04s)]
*  Where I am now. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2434.04s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Drew Sedora. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2436.04s)]
*  You know her from the cast of The Real Housewives of Atlanta. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2438.04s)]
*  Lauren. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2440.04s)]
*  Looking back because your project is here. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2442.04s)]
*  The music is here. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2444.04s)]
*  But looking back on it you brought up the Dennis Angel on Earth comment. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2446.04s)]
*  And that the people had conversations about that for a while. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2448.04s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2450.04s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2452.04s)]
*  You look grimy. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2454.04s)]
*  I'm not going to lie you look shady when it first came out. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2456.04s)]
*  Because it came out that you were working with Porsche's. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2458.04s)]
*  Porsche's Dennis? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2460.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2462.04s)]
*  Whatever Dennis is out here. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2464.04s)]
*  Yes Porsche's Dennis. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2466.04s)]
*  It's the shock for me. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2468.04s)]
*  Remember we had the conversation with Porsche about this whole thing. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2470.04s)]
*  And it was assumed that you did it behind Porsche's back without having. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2472.04s)]
*  Without talking to Porsche. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2474.04s)]
*  But that wasn't true. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2476.04s)]
*  That didn't happen like that. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2478.04s)]
*  See there we go. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2480.04s)]
*  See we got to talk about it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2482.04s)]
*  Because that's not how it happened. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2484.04s)]
*  So actually you know this is during a time Porsche was living her African Princess life. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2486.04s)]
*  She was in Nicaragua. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2488.04s)]
*  She was in Nigeria. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2490.04s)]
*  She wasn't checking for her girls. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2492.04s)]
*  You know I was calling her. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2494.04s)]
*  So on the record I called Porsche a bunch of times. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2496.04s)]
*  To tell her that you were going to work with Dennis. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2498.04s)]
*  Dennis had been reaching out for years. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2500.04s)]
*  Like come be an ambassador for Niagara. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2502.04s)]
*  It was like no no no. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2504.04s)]
*  But because of what I was going through. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2506.04s)]
*  This is my selfish season. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2508.04s)]
*  And the music was good. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2510.04s)]
*  Because I was like Dennis? Hot dogs? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2512.04s)]
*  Music? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2514.04s)]
*  I was confused like everybody else. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2516.04s)]
*  But when he sent my team the music it was like this is really good. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2518.04s)]
*  Like I need to do this music. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2520.04s)]
*  That's how it felt for me. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2522.04s)]
*  So when I was calling her. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2524.04s)]
*  And I was texting her. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2526.04s)]
*  I was giving her receipts. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2528.04s)]
*  I was showing her the reunion. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2530.04s)]
*  I was like girl I need to talk to you. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2532.04s)]
*  It's really really important. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2534.04s)]
*  She wasn't responding to you girl. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2536.04s)]
*  At all. Crickets. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2538.04s)]
*  So when she did come back and we did talk. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2540.04s)]
*  We were in the studio. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2542.04s)]
*  Dennis would be talking to her. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2544.04s)]
*  And she was like send me some songs. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2546.04s)]
*  She was like oh this is my favorite song. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2548.04s)]
*  This is my favorite song. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2550.04s)]
*  So I'm like okay Porsche you told me you had a conversation. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2552.04s)]
*  So she's cool. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2554.04s)]
*  I was like okay. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2556.04s)]
*  Because you know I wanted to make sure. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2558.04s)]
*  Like we're all family. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2560.04s)]
*  Yes girl I know. Like it's all good. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2562.04s)]
*  Let's hang out. A week before we filmed. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2564.04s)]
*  Oh sorry I didn't come to your birthday party girl. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2566.04s)]
*  But let's turn up tonight. You, me and Yandy. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2568.04s)]
*  Let's go out for drinks. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2570.04s)]
*  That was the energy. So we go to Shamiah's birthday party. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2572.04s)]
*  That's why I was so. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2574.04s)]
*  I had nothing to say. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2576.04s)]
*  It was like a light switch. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2578.04s)]
*  But if you notice when we were at Shamiah's party. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2580.04s)]
*  It was like I'm mad at you because you're working with Dennis. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2582.04s)]
*  Then it switched to well you're filming with Dennis. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2584.04s)]
*  And then it was like a go-naked thing. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2586.04s)]
*  So I was not clear on why she was upset. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2588.04s)]
*  And what the real beef was. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2590.04s)]
*  But as you've seen the season. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2592.04s)]
*  I just see you know the fans are smart. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2594.04s)]
*  Like shout out to the fans because they're seeing like. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2596.04s)]
*  No. You know. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2598.04s)]
*  We kind of catching her up in some lies here. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2600.04s)]
*  That's not actually how it happened. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2602.04s)]
*  And it seemed more like deflection. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2604.04s)]
*  Because you can't talk about a certain person. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2606.04s)]
*  So she chose to talk about me. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2608.04s)]
*  You know. But she couldn't. And she had said that. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2610.04s)]
*  You feel like she did it for the cameras. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2612.04s)]
*  You need a story. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2614.04s)]
*  But I mean you need to have things going on in your personal life. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2616.04s)]
*  Like why is everything about what I got going on. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2618.04s)]
*  It's hard to watch sometimes. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2620.04s)]
*  Because you don't know if it's real shade. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2622.04s)]
*  If it's real smoke or if it's just a story line. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2624.04s)]
*  No. Everything I do is real. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2626.04s)]
*  I came on the show in an Achilles rupture boot. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2628.04s)]
*  Like I came on the show living. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2630.04s)]
*  That's not how I want to come on. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2632.04s)]
*  I want to come in with my like Louboutins. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2634.04s)]
*  You know and be fabulous. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2636.04s)]
*  And I wanted to show black love and marriage and all the beauty and all that. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2638.04s)]
*  And I wanted to show this. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2640.04s)]
*  So everything that I've shown has just been my real life. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2642.04s)]
*  I've not ever produced anything or tried to give story line. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2644.04s)]
*  Because like I've been working since I was 8 years old. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2646.04s)]
*  I don't need to put on for cameras. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2648.04s)]
*  That's not me. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2650.04s)]
*  Some people may. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2652.04s)]
*  Like that's what some people may do. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2654.04s)]
*  And I feel like in this situation. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2656.04s)]
*  Instead of Portia opening up about like her real feelings. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2658.04s)]
*  Without talking about that particular person. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2660.04s)]
*  She didn't need to deflect it. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2662.04s)]
*  And make me her punching bag. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2664.04s)]
*  I think that was probably the most hurtful part. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2666.04s)]
*  I think that's what she did to me. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2668.04s)]
*  I think that's what she did to me. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2670.04s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going to do a lot too. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2672.04s)]
*  Did y'all have a real conversation? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2674.04s)]
*  Because it made you look crazy to the public at first. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2676.04s)]
*  When she got on there. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2678.04s)]
*  And says you're supposed to be my friend. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2680.04s)]
*  But you working with my ex and I had no idea. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2682.04s)]
*  Did y'all have a conversation after that? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2684.04s)]
*  We did. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2686.04s)]
*  We had to sit down. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2688.04s)]
*  It didn't go very well. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2690.04s)]
*  Which one are you talking about? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2692.04s)]
*  Grenada. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2694.04s)]
*  She's going to get up and walk away. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2696.04s)]
*  She's going to cover with all of this happiness. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2698.04s)]
*  Like she got it. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2700.04s)]
*  And that's not real. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2702.04s)]
*  And I think everyone was anticipating her to come back this season. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2704.04s)]
*  And was excited. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2706.04s)]
*  But ultimately she couldn't deliver on the story that we thought we were getting. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2708.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2710.04s)]
*  We thought we were getting Miss Gawadia. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2712.04s)]
*  And she couldn't bring that. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2714.04s)]
*  So you don't think Portia has been delivering this season to what you're saying? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2716.04s)]
*  I mean that's just what I feel. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2718.04s)]
*  That's my personal opinion. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2720.04s)]
*  Is that this wasn't a real beef. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2722.04s)]
*  It wasn't real. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2724.04s)]
*  You get two women together who are strong. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2726.04s)]
*  Who are bosses in their own right. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2728.04s)]
*  Have a conversation. We're not going to agree on everything. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2730.04s)]
*  But we don't need to make this the whole thing we're talking about for the whole season. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2732.04s)]
*  Me and Dennis? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2734.04s)]
*  The whole season? [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2736.04s)]
*  That's why I hate reality TV. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2738.04s)]
*  Because they will monetize your trauma for pain. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2740.04s)]
*  Like what you might be going through with your divorce. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2742.04s)]
*  Or what Portia might be going through. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2744.04s)]
*  It's just like damn. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2746.04s)]
*  And then if they can't get that they just want to pitch y'all against each other? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2748.04s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2750.04s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2752.04s)]
*  We're both going through a divorce. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2754.04s)]
*  We could be talking about that. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2756.04s)]
*  Everything doesn't have to be like a moment. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2758.04s)]
*  And I think you see some girls that come on the show. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2760.04s)]
*  And it's just like I need a moment. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2762.04s)]
*  Let me just say something to go viral or whatever. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2764.04s)]
*  And it's like no just be yourself. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2766.04s)]
*  And I think that's also how I've been able to be on now for four seasons. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2768.04s)]
*  And that's just what I've learned. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2770.04s)]
*  Because it's been a lot of cast shake ups. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2772.04s)]
*  Like I don't even know how I'm still here. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2774.04s)]
*  Because it's been people that are. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2776.04s)]
*  That were here. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2778.04s)]
*  And I don't know how I'm going to be able to go longer here. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2780.04s)]
*  But what I've learned from the OG's that have poured into me is just be yourself. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2782.04s)]
*  You know? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2784.04s)]
*  And the story will tell itself. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2786.04s)]
*  I just want to know the question. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2788.04s)]
*  So you're not with her go naked hairline? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2790.04s)]
*  I literally was about to ask. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2792.04s)]
*  So that's not go naked hair? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2794.04s)]
*  This right now? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2796.04s)]
*  No this looks good. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2798.04s)]
*  The hair that I was wearing in the sit down where you saw the bangs. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2800.04s)]
*  I wore it in real time because when you put it through a one two edit. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2802.04s)]
*  How I made it look. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2804.04s)]
*  It looked great. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2806.04s)]
*  That was go naked there. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2808.04s)]
*  So are you an ambassador for go naked? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2810.04s)]
*  No no no. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2812.04s)]
*  I have a great vendor. She's melted. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2814.04s)]
*  We're good. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2816.04s)]
*  So you don't like go naked hair is what you're saying? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2818.04s)]
*  I mean it just didn't work for me per se. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2820.04s)]
*  When you go to bleach blonde it. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2822.04s)]
*  It just did something. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2824.04s)]
*  That wasn't right. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2826.04s)]
*  Would you have said that prior to all this Dennis stuff? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2828.04s)]
*  Because I thought you were so. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2830.04s)]
*  It was a good partnership. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2832.04s)]
*  And in the beginning of the season you said you thought you were doing numbers for go naked. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2834.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2836.04s)]
*  Well I just believe like as black women we support each other. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2838.04s)]
*  If you're my girl I'm going to support you. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2840.04s)]
*  We have a great work relationship. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2842.04s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2844.04s)]
*  It was fun to work with her at that time. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2846.04s)]
*  And if that's your friend you're going to hold your friend down. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2848.04s)]
*  But it was just when all of this started to happen. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2850.04s)]
*  It just became corny to me. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2852.04s)]
*  So I'm like okay well now since we're going to. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2854.04s)]
*  You're going to drag me. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2856.04s)]
*  Well I'm going to speak my truth then. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2858.04s)]
*  Because the truth is like I had your back but if you don't have my back now it's fair game. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2860.04s)]
*  No you're saying alright let me be honest about this hair. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2862.04s)]
*  Yeah I'll be honest. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2864.04s)]
*  I would rather go naked than to wear that hair again. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2866.04s)]
*  You think the show would still be interesting if you and Portia weren't beefing or like tension just part of the paycheck? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2868.04s)]
*  I mean I came on the show. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2874.04s)]
*  Let me make it clear because I've been an actress. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2876.04s)]
*  Because I was literally like in grade school right. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2878.04s)]
*  So I made a decision because I was like you know what people know me from this role. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2880.04s)]
*  They may not like me from this role. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2884.04s)]
*  Or that role or that movie or whatever. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2886.04s)]
*  I fell going through COVID. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2888.04s)]
*  It was just an opportunity to be more vulnerable. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2890.04s)]
*  And let the fans really get to know me. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2892.04s)]
*  And see me as a mother and a wife and a friend and a sister. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2894.04s)]
*  Like I'm so many other things. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2898.04s)]
*  And I wanted to show that. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2900.04s)]
*  And so that was the reason for me joining the show. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2902.04s)]
*  It wasn't to do anything. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2904.04s)]
*  But just hopefully inspire other people. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2906.04s)]
*  Going through what I'm dealing with. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2908.04s)]
*  And connecting that way. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2910.04s)]
*  So it wasn't to show what is happening. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2912.04s)]
*  Like that was opposite of what I wanted to represent on this platform. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2914.04s)]
*  So I've never subscribed to let's do this. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2918.04s)]
*  I've never subscribed to let's do this for a moment. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2920.04s)]
*  You know let's do this for storyline. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2922.04s)]
*  I actually feel like when we used to watch Housewives. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2924.04s)]
*  And when it was nostalgic. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2928.04s)]
*  Was because it was a group of women who were really friends. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2930.04s)]
*  And when you saw them fall out. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2932.04s)]
*  It was because I'm fighting you because I love you. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2934.04s)]
*  And I know you can be better. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2936.04s)]
*  You can do so much more. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2938.04s)]
*  So that was where the beefs came. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2940.04s)]
*  And then they were able to resolve and move forward. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2942.04s)]
*  And I feel like here sometimes they just want to like kill you off. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2944.04s)]
*  You know. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2946.04s)]
*  Like are we building or not? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2948.04s)]
*  And so that's what I would like to see the show get back to. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2950.04s)]
*  And I think this season overall it was refreshing. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2952.04s)]
*  It wasn't dark. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2954.04s)]
*  You know as some of the fans have said. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2956.04s)]
*  Like they felt like the show was going dark. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2958.04s)]
*  So I think we're moving towards a more positive place. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2960.04s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Drew Sedora. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2962.04s)]
*  From the Real Housewives of Atlanta. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2964.04s)]
*  Jess. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2966.04s)]
*  So you don't see a resolve. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2968.04s)]
*  You and this girl at all. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2970.04s)]
*  You don't see it at all. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2972.04s)]
*  Because you said you want to see the show get back to. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2974.04s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2976.04s)]
*  I don't know what that was. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2978.04s)]
*  What it used to be. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2980.04s)]
*  Women were able to have their arguments. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2982.04s)]
*  Go through it. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2984.04s)]
*  Talk it out. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2986.04s)]
*  And then they're cool. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2988.04s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2990.04s)]
*  You don't ever see you and Portia. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2992.04s)]
*  Like you know what. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2994.04s)]
*  Let's just put all this behind us. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2996.04s)]
*  Because it did get crazy. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=2998.04s)]
*  It did. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3000.04s)]
*  But all right. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3002.04s)]
*  I can't say I'm not happy. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3004.04s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3006.04s)]
*  I don't know what that is. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3008.04s)]
*  And I think that's the beauty of it. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3010.04s)]
*  It's not like there's a lot of grotesque qualities. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3012.04s)]
*  It's damaging to my character. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3014.04s)]
*  To me as a person. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3016.04s)]
*  You know I have kids. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3018.04s)]
*  So I just feel like the line has been crossed. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3020.04s)]
*  One too many times. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3022.04s)]
*  However I feel like. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3024.04s)]
*  You know if there's an opportunity to have a real conversation. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3026.04s)]
*  And it may not happen on camera. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3028.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3030.04s)]
*  But it hasn't happened. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3032.04s)]
*  It's a year now. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3034.04s)]
*  I want to ask some questions about you Drew. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3036.04s)]
*  You've been in this game since you were a kid. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3038.04s)]
*  How do you think Hollywood's perception of you has changed? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3040.04s)]
*  And how has your own perception of yourself changed? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3042.04s)]
*  Oh good. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3044.04s)]
*  Well you know I feel like. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3046.04s)]
*  On the side of the theatrical. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3048.04s)]
*  You know TV and film. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3050.04s)]
*  I'm proud of what I've been able to accomplish. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3052.04s)]
*  You know in my career sometimes I don't reflect enough. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3054.04s)]
*  And I'm like wow. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3056.04s)]
*  I've been able to work with some amazing actors. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3058.04s)]
*  And some amazing projects. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3060.04s)]
*  And tell some amazing stories. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3062.04s)]
*  But the game. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3064.04s)]
*  It's like that's one project. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3066.04s)]
*  That I just feel like the public perceives me. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3068.04s)]
*  In that way. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3070.04s)]
*  And I can't shake it. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3072.04s)]
*  And it's like what decade? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3074.04s)]
*  Is it been a decade now? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3076.04s)]
*  I mean I still see the comments to this day. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3078.04s)]
*  Which is saying okay this was obviously something really big. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3080.04s)]
*  And a part of the culture. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3082.04s)]
*  But I did see a hashtag where it was like. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3084.04s)]
*  Hashtag cancel the Drew Cedar hate. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3086.04s)]
*  I just want to say can we do that please? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3088.04s)]
*  At the end of the day this has gone on too long. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3090.04s)]
*  Derwin lied to Drew Cedar. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3092.04s)]
*  Like did we not all watch the same show? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3094.04s)]
*  You feel like they hate Carrie from there? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3096.04s)]
*  Oh most definitely. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3098.04s)]
*  I see the comments I'm like wow. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3100.04s)]
*  And I've met people that's like oh I'm mad at you. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3102.04s)]
*  Because you broke up mad school. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3104.04s)]
*  And I'm like you know Tia was married right? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3106.04s)]
*  You know pooch as a whole family. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3108.04s)]
*  But people were very invested in the show. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3110.04s)]
*  And I just think that's a perception people have of me. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3112.04s)]
*  You know despite all the various roles I've played. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3114.04s)]
*  Which is why I did join the show to try to change that narrative. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3116.04s)]
*  And I think for myself. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3120.04s)]
*  Yes my perception of self is. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3122.04s)]
*  I have so many things I want to do. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3124.04s)]
*  I want to do Broadway. I want to direct. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3126.04s)]
*  I want to produce my first film. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3128.04s)]
*  And continue to open the door for other young talent coming up. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3130.04s)]
*  And so that's where I'm moving into. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3132.04s)]
*  Of my contribution stage in life. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3134.04s)]
*  And wanting to really see others win as well. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3136.04s)]
*  In this business. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3138.04s)]
*  I think the thing with the game was right. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3140.04s)]
*  Everybody else had fictional names. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3142.04s)]
*  But you really went on there as Drew Sedora. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3144.04s)]
*  Like you. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3146.04s)]
*  Why was that? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3148.04s)]
*  Shout out to Mara Brockackill. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3150.04s)]
*  Shout out to Drew. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3152.04s)]
*  I love that woman. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3154.04s)]
*  You know actually. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3156.04s)]
*  So the story behind that is I booked Girlfriends. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3158.04s)]
*  I did an episode of Girlfriends. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3160.04s)]
*  And when I went on set. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3162.04s)]
*  She remembered meeting me. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3164.04s)]
*  Coming to my home because my sister Allison. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3166.04s)]
*  Has been my manager since I was like 8 years old. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3168.04s)]
*  And so she came to the house to meet my sister. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3170.04s)]
*  She was a big fan of mine. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3172.04s)]
*  Rock Martin. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3174.04s)]
*  Worked from the William Morris agency. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3176.04s)]
*  Like OG right. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3178.04s)]
*  And so she came to my sister's house. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3180.04s)]
*  To see if she would share her Rolodex. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3182.04s)]
*  Because she was moving to Los Angeles. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3184.04s)]
*  To become a producer. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3186.04s)]
*  And she's like Drew when you were 8. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3188.04s)]
*  You were running around the house. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3190.04s)]
*  Talking about I'm going to be an actress. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3192.04s)]
*  And a singer. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3194.04s)]
*  And you really stuck with it. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3196.04s)]
*  And so for that reason let's talk about some bigger things. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3198.04s)]
*  So I was like wow. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3200.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3202.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3204.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3206.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3208.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3210.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3212.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3214.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3216.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3218.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3220.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3222.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3224.04s)]
*  I was like wow. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3226.04s)]
*  And so she came to me. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3228.04s)]
*  And Love 4 Minute. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3230.04s)]
*  With Ciara. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3232.04s)]
*  Shout out to Ciara Gates. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3234.04s)]
*  She came and laid like a bar. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3236.04s)]
*  Little situation. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3238.04s)]
*  I thought you were talking about Russell Wilson Ciara. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3240.04s)]
*  You talking about Ciara Gates. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3242.04s)]
*  Oh girl. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3244.04s)]
*  I know Ciara was rapping. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3246.04s)]
*  She was rapping. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3248.04s)]
*  A lot of people don't know she came in. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3250.04s)]
*  But it's a very emotional record. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3252.04s)]
*  And that was the record that actually Dennis and I were in the studio. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3254.04s)]
*  He was over there crying about Portia. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3256.04s)]
*  And I was in there having my moment. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3258.04s)]
*  But it is. It's an emotional record. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3260.04s)]
*  But I did it to me as very representative of the project. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3262.04s)]
*  Because it's about taking accountability. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3264.04s)]
*  And that's why I love that record. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3266.04s)]
*  Because I can sit here and share with you guys. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3268.04s)]
*  All the things that my ex did. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3270.04s)]
*  That weren't right. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3272.04s)]
*  But it gets tiring after a while to keep blaming everything on the other person. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3274.04s)]
*  So for me it's like no. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3278.04s)]
*  I played a part. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3280.04s)]
*  There were things I could have done better if I'm being honest. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3282.04s)]
*  And so that's what the song is saying. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3284.04s)]
*  Like look in the mirror. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3286.04s)]
*  It's not easy to do. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3288.04s)]
*  But you gotta sometimes look at yourself and say okay yeah. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3290.04s)]
*  I made a mistake here, there. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3292.04s)]
*  And I could have been better and then grow from that. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3294.04s)]
*  Do you let him know that? [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3296.04s)]
*  I have. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3298.04s)]
*  Actually we have had conversations before we go to court. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3300.04s)]
*  Because when you go to court that's when everything blows back up. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3302.04s)]
*  But we've had conversations where we have stated. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3304.04s)]
*  We understand our differences now. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3306.04s)]
*  And I can say I could have done this better. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3308.04s)]
*  And he has said it. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3310.04s)]
*  And yeah like we're humans. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3312.04s)]
*  And just being more gentle with ourselves. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3314.04s)]
*  And just forgiving each other. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3316.04s)]
*  Doesn't erase everything. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3318.04s)]
*  And every pain that we cause. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3320.04s)]
*  But yeah we can be honest and say you know I wasn't perfect. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3322.04s)]
*  I can say that. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3324.04s)]
*  And every time I watch your interviews you're breaking down. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3326.04s)]
*  Every single time. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3328.04s)]
*  And I'm wondering why put more stuff out there like Michael B. Jordan. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3330.04s)]
*  Have you spoke to him since the Carlos King interview? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3332.04s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3334.04s)]
*  That was a question. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3336.04s)]
*  That was a big one. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3338.04s)]
*  So in Carlos King's interview. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3340.04s)]
*  Carlos King asked her who's one of the most famous people she's dated. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3342.04s)]
*  And she mentioned that she used to date Michael B. Jordan back in the day. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3344.04s)]
*  And that was everywhere. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3346.04s)]
*  I'm like whoa she just be volunteering to info. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3348.04s)]
*  Well I get asked a question. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3350.04s)]
*  I am. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3352.04s)]
*  No. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3354.04s)]
*  No. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3356.04s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3358.04s)]
*  He asked me on a date to attend the NAACP awards. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3360.04s)]
*  It was probably like 2006. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3362.04s)]
*  When he was still on the soap operas. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3364.04s)]
*  And I met his mom and stuff. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3366.04s)]
*  It was cool. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3368.04s)]
*  We went out a couple of days. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3370.04s)]
*  There was no intimacy on the record. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3372.04s)]
*  But still he was a very very sweet guy. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3374.04s)]
*  Very very sweet. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3376.04s)]
*  And he's been super successful. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3378.04s)]
*  But yeah that's my truth and it happened. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3380.04s)]
*  This is my last question. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3382.04s)]
*  With all the healing that you've gotten. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3384.04s)]
*  And what you know now. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3386.04s)]
*  If you could go back and whisper something to yourself during the hardest moment of your marriage. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3388.04s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3390.04s)]
*  The hardest part of my marriage. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3392.04s)]
*  I think. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3394.04s)]
*  I think. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3396.04s)]
*  Ralph moving out of the bedroom. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3398.04s)]
*  You know. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3400.04s)]
*  That it felt like abandonment. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3402.04s)]
*  You know what I mean. It's different to like go sleep separately. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3404.04s)]
*  But him making the decision to move out. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3406.04s)]
*  Instead of fighting. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3408.04s)]
*  Because people don't stay [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3410.04s)]
*  married forever without waking up every day and choosing each other. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3412.04s)]
*  So when the person wakes up and doesn't choose you. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3414.04s)]
*  So when the person wakes up and doesn't choose you. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3416.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3418.04s)]

*  On The Breakfast Club. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3470.04s)]
*  Well speaking of Portia. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3472.04s)]
*  Portia Williams and Nini Leakes [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3474.04s)]
*  may be rekindling. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3476.04s)]
*  The girls might be getting back together. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3478.04s)]
*  So Portia was on her YouTube channel. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3480.04s)]
*  And she was taking fan questions. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3482.04s)]
*  And they asked her about Nini. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3484.04s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3486.04s)]
*  Portia said that she would be open to reconciling with you. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3488.04s)]
*  Not this one. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3490.04s)]
*  Would you reconcile with Nini? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3492.04s)]
*  Listen. Life is short. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3494.04s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. Life is short. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3496.04s)]
*  This year a lot of the cast and me personally have had a lot of loss in my family. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3498.04s)]
*  And so life is short. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3506.04s)]
*  And so the right situation, the right conversation can absolutely be had. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3508.04s)]
*  I don't think there's anything there that's completely to the point where there couldn't be a conversation. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3512.04s)]
*  Yes. Now that's a step in the right direction. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3520.04s)]
*  But then Nini Leakes was on her show, The Nini Leakes Show. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3522.04s)]
*  And she was asked about Portia's comments. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3526.04s)]
*  And her response. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3528.04s)]
*  Let's take a listen to that. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3530.04s)]
*  Portia said that she would be open to reconciling with you. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3532.04s)]
*  Well of course you would sweetheart. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3534.04s)]
*  Because I never did s*** to you. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3536.04s)]
*  In the first place. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3538.04s)]
*  When I said what I said about Portia, I said again, what happened, happens. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3540.04s)]
*  Like I'm not one of those people who just walk around in my everyday life just lying about stuff. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3544.04s)]
*  Like it just don't work for me. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3548.04s)]
*  I said what I said, it was the truth. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3550.04s)]
*  It really happened. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3552.04s)]
*  She was going through a divorce with Simon. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3554.04s)]
*  And I think she said something like I didn't check on her. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3556.04s)]
*  Or something like that. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3558.04s)]
*  Girl, this ain't your first divorce. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3560.04s)]
*  Maybe I could have checked on her. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3562.04s)]
*  I honestly didn't even think about it like that. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3564.04s)]
*  Somebody that maybe missed it once or twice. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3566.04s)]
*  So get them a little grace. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3568.04s)]
*  Who knows what they were going through that day. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3570.04s)]
*  I don't have a problem with reconciling with Portia. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3572.04s)]
*  But I'm going to tell about herself first honey. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3574.04s)]
*  So when do you want to have a drink so we can fix this Portia? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3576.04s)]
*  Nothing wrong with that. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3580.04s)]
*  It's not like they fit the NJR rule. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3582.04s)]
*  They can smooth that over. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3584.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3586.04s)]
*  And for those of you guys who do not remember. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3588.04s)]
*  It fell out when Portia was going through her divorce with Simon. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3590.04s)]
*  And she said that Nini didn't check in on her little sis. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3592.04s)]
*  And Nini had said that Portia didn't want to film with her at one point. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3594.04s)]
*  And she alleged that Portia was distancing herself. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3596.04s)]
*  And she tried to reach out to Portia. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3602.04s)]
*  And Portia responded with the cold shoulder. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3604.04s)]
*  Not wanting to deal with her anymore. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3606.04s)]
*  They've been rocky since then. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3608.04s)]
*  And they've thrown their little blows. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3610.04s)]
*  But good to hear that. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3612.04s)]
*  But I would love to know if Portia is open to sitting down and having those drinks. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3614.04s)]
*  Like immediately. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3616.04s)]
*  And if she's going to push for Nini to be back on the show. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3618.04s)]
*  These ladies were really never, never friends. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3620.04s)]
*  The show put them together. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3622.04s)]
*  And now they're quote unquote best friends. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3624.04s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3626.04s)]
*  Do you think Portia and Shamali... [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3628.04s)]
*  Shamia. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3630.04s)]
*  Do you think she's sitting down with Drew? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3632.04s)]
*  No. Portia's not sitting down with Drew no time soon. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3634.04s)]
*  Especially not at the interview we just had with Drew. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3636.04s)]
*  Shamia made it seem like they were a force fit. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3638.04s)]
*  But other than those two, they're not really friend friends. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3640.04s)]
*  Nini made me think though are all divorces different? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3642.04s)]
*  Because she said that this ain't your first time being divorced. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3644.04s)]
*  Let's say you're friends with Kim Kardashian. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3646.04s)]
*  Kim Kardashian right. Kim Kardashian's been divorced like what? Four times. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3648.04s)]
*  So she gets married again and gets divorced again. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3650.04s)]
*  Do you check on her? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3652.04s)]
*  That is kind of a point right? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3654.04s)]
*  You've been through this before. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3656.04s)]
*  You been down this road already? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3658.04s)]
*  Do you? I don't know. Are all divorces different? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3660.04s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3662.04s)]
*  I mean I would say so. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3664.04s)]
*  Probably so depending on circumstances and stuff like that. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3666.04s)]
*  Oh I was going to say... [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3668.04s)]
*  No. It's a segment. I'm going to talk. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3670.04s)]
*  Talk. Speak up. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3672.04s)]
*  We don't want to hear nothing from Lauren about our relationships. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3674.04s)]
*  We haven't gone down that road in a while. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3676.04s)]
*  But nothing has changed. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3678.04s)]
*  That's the only reason I was like shh. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3680.04s)]
*  I was going to say as an avid housewife watcher. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3682.04s)]
*  Oh okay. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3684.04s)]
*  Because you don't even know Shemeah's name. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3686.04s)]
*  As an avid housewife watcher, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3688.04s)]
*  we watched the different divorces. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3690.04s)]
*  And I think this one even though they're all public, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3692.04s)]
*  it was a really big deal because it came out of nowhere. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3694.04s)]
*  She was all happy and the next day it was just over. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3696.04s)]
*  But again... [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3698.04s)]
*  That affected trying to deport her right? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3700.04s)]
*  Ice got him. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3702.04s)]
*  Simon! [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3704.04s)]
*  Oh. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3706.04s)]
*  I was like damn they just deporting all types of people on that show. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3708.04s)]
*  What is that? Real housewives of... [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3710.04s)]
*  Well Portia Carlos. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3712.04s)]
*  Let me know if this reunion is happening or not. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3714.04s)]
*  Because yeah we need to know what's going on. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3716.04s)]
*  But moving on. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3718.04s)]
*  Speaking of the girls getting together. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3720.04s)]
*  Glowrilla has announced a release date [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3722.04s)]
*  for her sample of Keisha Cole's [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3724.04s)]
*  love. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3726.04s)]
*  She says that's my type of N-word. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3728.04s)]
*  It's going to be coming this Friday. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3730.04s)]
*  She already has a pre-save. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3732.04s)]
*  Tomorrow Friday. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3734.04s)]
*  The pre-save link is already in her bio. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3736.04s)]
*  And this is the song that she's been kind of teasing [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3738.04s)]
*  since Coachella. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3740.04s)]
*  Glowrilla be going! [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3742.04s)]
*  Glowrilla be going! [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3744.04s)]
*  Glowrilla don't miss you hear me? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3746.04s)]
*  Flash sister with the shot. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3748.04s)]
*  Okay? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3750.04s)]
*  Who's that singing? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3752.04s)]
*  What's that singing? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3754.04s)]
*  She's sample love. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3756.04s)]
*  I think those are her vocals over it. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3758.04s)]
*  That sounded like Keisha. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3760.04s)]
*  That sounded like Keisha. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3762.04s)]
*  This is slow down. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3764.04s)]
*  They just. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3766.04s)]
*  Yeah they just changed the pitch. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3768.04s)]
*  Chopped and screwed. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3770.04s)]
*  I was going to say that Keisha Cole actually told us [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3772.04s)]
*  exclusively here that that was going down when she came [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3774.04s)]
*  here to talk to us. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3776.04s)]
*  She told us that she cleared it. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3778.04s)]
*  So now we will see that Friday. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3780.04s)]
*  I'm looking forward to it. That's it for the hours. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3782.04s)]
*  Alright well we'll see you next hour. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3784.04s)]
*  What? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3786.04s)]
*  We gotta be quiet. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3788.04s)]
*  Did you find out that the clips were never signed to [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3790.04s)]
*  Dev Jam? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3792.04s)]
*  It's a new day. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3794.04s)]
*  God has granted another 24 hours. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3796.04s)]
*  We gon' focus. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3798.04s)]
*  Okay let's make this show. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3800.04s)]
*  She almost said get off my D. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3802.04s)]
*  I did. I couldn't though. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3804.04s)]
*  I remembered I collected and gathered myself. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3806.04s)]
*  I didn't know they was texting you a lot after the. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3808.04s)]
*  I didn't get a text. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3810.04s)]
*  I didn't. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3812.04s)]
*  Alright. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3814.04s)]

*  And people trust her. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=3820.04s)]

*  program? No. Is African American studies a DEI program? I think I answered that with [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4181.8s)]
*  one of your questions. I'm asking it again. Just yes or no. We should be able to teach [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4187.6s)]
*  courses in our environment. My point is they are DEI programs, both of them, because students [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4191.84s)]

*  we should have because he was a huge actor at the time. Yeah, he'd done Soul Food, Menace [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4961.76s)]

*  And a lot of people have been asking for years. Jesus Christ. God dang it. I spoke to him. These [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4970.08s)]
*  are his words, not mine. His words, not mine. He literally, this is the premise of the documentary, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4974.8s)]
*  a big part of it is people feel like he just went missing and they don't know why. And it's [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4980.96s)]
*  because he actually was dealing with a very serious illness. So he has a autoimmune disease. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4985.2s)]
*  It's a very rare one called Castleman's disease. So this disease, it affects his lymph nodes and [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=4991.52s)]

*  well for him. He was so good at it. But an agent at the time told him that people don't want to see [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5001.92s)]
*  sick kids on TV. So he took a step back to just try and figure some things out. But he wants this [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5006.160000000001s)]
*  documentary to not only be a celebration of the cast and the movie and what it did for storytelling, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5012.64s)]
*  especially in Chicago, but he also wants to tell his story too about what he struggled with behind [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5016.96s)]
*  the scenes. Yeah, because he couldn't act. And he said also today he had a few near-death experiences [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5021.36s)]
*  that he never could talk about because he always thought if he could get back to screen, he didn't [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5027.04s)]
*  want that to be the story. But now he's bringing it to the screen with the help of his cast and [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5030.719999999999s)]

*  Because you remember the nostalgia you felt when you first watched those films back in the day. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5043.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. They didn't want to see sick kids on TV. We don't mind that. Everybody's welcome. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5047.839999999999s)]
*  Well, we wouldn't know they're sick unless they told us. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5054.32s)]
*  And that was his thing. He just thought he could get under control and not have to tell us and then [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5056.879999999999s)]
*  come back to TV. But it was such a thing that he's been doing other things and he's doing things as [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5060.4s)]

*  in the latest, Halle Berry got into some trouble back on Mother's Day. Y'all remember the video [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5163.5199999999995s)]
*  she posted with her man? She was laid up in bed. Yep. Okay. So she posted that video and people [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5171.92s)]
*  were upset. They were upset because she was in her bed with her man. And they were talking about a [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5176.16s)]
*  few things. Let's take a listen to the original video. Show y'all how my day started. How my [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5180.4s)]
*  Mother's Day started. And now I'm going to tell you about it. I'm not going to show you. I'm going [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5185.68s)]
*  to tell you about how my Mother's Day is going to end. You know what I mean? Yes. I wish you'd hurry [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5190.88s)]
*  up, too. First of all, we got our Let's Spin because Let's Spin just came out in this cute [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5197.04s)]
*  little travel size. And so since we're in Cannes, France, I traveled with it for the first time. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5203.76s)]
*  And we're about to give it a spin. You're about to Cannes with your band. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5208.56s)]
*  How are you mad because she was in bed with her man? People were upset because she was talking openly about sex. They're saying should she be talking about this on Mother's Day? Should she be with her kids somewhere? There were a lot of things. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5212.24s)]
*  She was in bed with her man promoting her product. How do you bring our kids? That's a good question. I didn't think that was going to happen. I was going to ask Google AI. I'm not for sure if her man has kids that they love. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5227.28s)]
*  But even if so, she made a good point in her response. Let's take a listen to her response. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5241.36s)]
*  Well, speaking of motherhood, on Mother's Day, you created a little stir. So there was a reaction which even cut you a little bit off guard, maybe. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5247.759999999999s)]
*  It did because other women got in their feelings. And was it right for her to be in her bed talking about spinning with her man? Yes. And they were saying, should she be talking about that on Mother's Day? Shouldn't she be with her kids somewhere? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5256.08s)]
*  First of all, it's not kids day. It's called Mother's Day. Yes, it is. Kids Day is every day of the year. It's kids day. That's my day. And if I want to be in bed and spin with my man, then that's what I'm going to do. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5269.6s)]
*  And to answer your question, Holly Berry does have kids. She's been a mom since 2008 per People Magazine. She has two kids. Yes, she has two kids. But she was promoting her product and she's been promoting this product forever. It didn't come out of nowhere. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5282.160000000001s)]
*  It's KY, right? Or something like that? Some type of lubricant? It's a lubricant, but it's not called KY. I know it's not called KY, but it's a lubricant. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5294.32s)]
*  Yes, it's basically that. And remember, we were talking about the whole like menopause and she was talking about like after menopause, things dry up a little bit. And she's been having these conversations. So it was promotion and she's happy and I don't understand why people care. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5302.32s)]
*  People think she's too grown for that. They think she's too mature for that. They think Holly Berry shouldn't be doing that. Like, what is it? I'm trying to figure out what's the commotion here. I think people are stupid. I mean, she has two kids. It's Mother's Day. She could do Mother's Day how she wants to do Mother's Day. And a lot of times, you know what? Mother's Day, you know what? I spend all my time with my kids. I want to date for myself on Mother's Day and that's fine. I thought that's what kind of like what happens anyway for everybody. I'm so mad I didn't know that she had kids. I didn't even know that either. We've never seen them. You know what I mean? Well, I can't say we, but I have never seen them. She has a daughter and a son. I like how she talked about sex. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5314.32s)]
*  Like she's about to go shoot up her ops. She said I'm gonna spin on it. That's the name of her product. Oh, that's what it's called? It's called less spin. It's an intimacy jail. Damn. You know what I'm saying? She talk like she got the chopper. She's about to wet up a whole block. That is true. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5344.32s)]
*  Crazy spin. We spin on that thing. Okay. On that thing. What else? You got a woman to a girl. If I'm gonna know something, they make one for me. You know, you be saying you need help. I don't need no help. I'm good. Okay. That [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5366.32s)]
*  is true. You wrote a book. That was a long time ago. I was just trying to say. That was a long time ago. That was a long time ago. That was a long time ago. That was a long time ago. I've known my wife since she was 16. That book is going to outlive you. That's alright. That book is going to outlive the two. A hundred years from now people are going to be reading that book saying wow. So that was a time when men could make their women talk. There was a time back in the day, you know, there was a time. That's the latest with Lauren. When we come back, we got the people's choice mix. Let's go. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InPC8DaOR0&t=5388.32s)]
