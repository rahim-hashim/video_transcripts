*  I'm glad they passed these phone laws all over the country, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=190.72s)]
*  because there's no way [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  if somebody is completely stopped in a yield, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  because you gotta wait for traffic. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=198.92s)]
*  There's no way to get rear-ended like that, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=200.6s)]
*  unless you're just not paying no attention whatsoever. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=202.16s)]

*  Did you go to the hospital? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=226.08s)]
*  Damn right, I went to the hospital. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  Not right after that though, did you? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=228.12s)]
*  Not right after. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=229.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I thought. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  But I went later, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  because I guess the adrenaline stuff [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=232.32s)]
*  didn't have me feeling no pain, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  but then later on that day, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  I started feeling pain, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=235.72s)]
*  so I went to the hospital later. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=236.55999999999997s)]
*  How big was it, the car? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=238.27999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you're okay. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  His car, he had like a, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  I think it was a Nissan something, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=241.72s)]
*  one of them little Nissan cars. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=243.11999999999998s)]
*  I was so small. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  Oh, okay, okay. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  You're used to bigger. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=245.64s)]
*  It hit hard, it definitely hit hard. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=246.48s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you're okay. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=248.6s)]
*  Because you know the thing about getting hit [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=249.92s)]
*  from the back, you know what I'm saying? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=250.92s)]
*  You at least want to be able to take a breath [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  and be prepared for it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=253.39999999999998s)]
*  You know, you can't just let somebody do it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=254.48s)]
*  When he hit you, was you like, ah! [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=257.36s)]
*  I was on the phone actually, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=259.68s)]
*  and the person heard it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=260.76s)]
*  And the person was like, what was that loud bang? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=261.6s)]
*  You'd buy yourself, hopefully. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=266.12s)]
*  Yeah, thank God, yes, absolutely. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=267.12s)]
*  All right, well, let's get the show cracking. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Sherri Shepherd will be joining us this morning. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=270.8s)]
*  She's in the new Netflix film, Straw, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=273.36s)]
*  so we'll be kicking with Sherri Shepherd. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=275.24s)]
*  The number one film on Netflix. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=276.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, Taraji was here Friday. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=277.56s)]
*  You know, that's a Tyler Perry film. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=279.20000000000005s)]
*  She was here Friday talking about it, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=280.56s)]
*  and it's been number one on Netflix all weekend. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=282.12s)]
*  It's really good, y'all, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=283.88s)]
*  so y'all should watch it if y'all get a chance. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=285.04s)]
*  All right, and then Lauren London is broadcasting live [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=287.04s)]
*  from LA. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  Lauren London. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=290.04s)]
*  Lauren LaRosa. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=291.04s)]
*  I was gonna say, okay. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=291.88s)]
*  Lauren LaRosa is broadcasting live from LA. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  That's right, from the BET Awards, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=295.52s)]
*  so we'll be kicking it in with her in a little bit. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=297.04s)]
*  But let's get the show cracking. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=298.92s)]
*  Front page news is next. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=300.2s)]

*  Good morning. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=302.08s)]

*  It's DJ Envy Jess Hilarious, Charlamagne the Guy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=303.74s)]
*  We are the Breakfast Club. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=306.36s)]
*  Let's get in some front page news. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=307.44s)]
*  Now, last night, OKC beat the Pacers, 123 to 107. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  The series is tied 1-1. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=315.88s)]
*  The next game, I believe, is on Tuesday. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=317.68s)]
*  And as I keep telling y'all, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=321.16s)]
*  Tyrese Halliburton gotta do more. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=322.56s)]
*  If y'all gonna be having these conversations [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=324.24s)]
*  about him being the face of the league [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=325.72s)]
*  and all this other stuff, you gotta do more. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  You can't have five points after three quarters, bro. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=328.8s)]
*  No. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=331.44s)]
*  Well, good morning, Morgan. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  Good morning, good morning, happy Monday. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, I wanna believe that it's a happy Monday, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  but there is a lot going on. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=336.72s)]
*  First, on front page, y'all. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=337.88s)]
*  National Guard troops are on the ground [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=339.92s)]
*  in Los Angeles, California, following anti-ICE protests. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=341.46000000000004s)]
*  Now, President Trump deployed 2,000 members [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  of the California National Guard [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=347.24s)]
*  in a move sharply criticized as inflammatory [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  and unnecessary by both California Governor Gavin Newsom [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=351.6s)]
*  and LA Mayor Karen Bass. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=354.76000000000005s)]
*  Now, over the weekend, Trump said he's ready [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  to enforce law and order as anti-ICE protests continue. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=358.48s)]
*  The president spoke briefly on his way to Camp David [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  on Sunday as he was boarding Air Force One. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=365.40000000000003s)]
*  We saw him trip, right? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=367.56s)]
*  But saying that he will hold protesters accountable. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  Let's take a listen to that audio, if you can. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=371.44s)]
*  Again, it's at the airport. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  We see danger to our country and to our citizens. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=375.48s)]
*  We'll be very, very strong in terms of law and order. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=378.64s)]
*  It's about law and order. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=381.4s)]
*  If you have violent people, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=382.96s)]
*  then you're not gonna let them get away with it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=384.56s)]
*  So California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=387.04s)]
*  again, calling it purposefully inflammatory. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=391.0s)]
*  LA Mayor Karen Bass says the situation in Los Angeles [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=393.72s)]
*  is about an agenda. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=396.88s)]
*  Now, she made those comments also on Sunday. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=398.36s)]
*  On the third day of the protest, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=400.56s)]
*  let's take a listen to her comments. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=402.12s)]
*  But we need to be real about this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=403.92s)]
*  This is about another agenda. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=405.76s)]
*  It's not about public safety. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=408.44s)]
*  There's clearly no plan and there is clearly no policy. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=410.04s)]
*  When you raid Home Depot and workplaces, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=413.8s)]
*  when you tear parents and children apart, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  and when you run armored caravans through our streets, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=419.36s)]
*  you cause fear and you cause panic. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=422.8s)]
*  I'll tell you one thing, Trump really wasted no time [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=425.76s)]
*  doing the worst of everything folks thought he would. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=427.76s)]
*  Like, you can't put the military on protesters. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=430.36s)]
*  Did I miss something? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=433.12s)]
*  Were they not being peaceful? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  Because I didn't hear about any ruckus or violence [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=435.52s)]
*  until the National Guard showed up. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  I did see one video, I guess it was a protest [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=439.24s)]
*  to throwing rocks or bricks at cars. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=441.56s)]
*  I guess they were agents when they were driving by. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=444.0s)]
*  Did you see that video, Morgan? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=447.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=447.84s)]
*  And I also saw- [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=448.68s)]
*  But did that call for the National Guard? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=449.52s)]
*  You know, it got very volatile over there. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=451.68s)]
*  But to your point, I mean, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=455.4s)]
*  but this isn't the first time he's done this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  He did this back in 2020, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=458.08s)]
*  following the death of George Floyd [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=460.28s)]
*  and the protests that happened here in Washington, D.C. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  So he's no stranger to calling his own military, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=464.8s)]
*  his own, the National Guard in for protesters, as you said, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=467.8s)]
*  peaceful protesters at that, so. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  But yeah, Kristi Noem, Homeland Security Secretary, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=474.36s)]
*  Kristi Noem basically said that the National Guard [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=477.44s)]
*  was brought in for public safety. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=479.44s)]
*  So that's what they essentially said it was for. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=481.32s)]
*  But I'm not gonna get too much into that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=483.0s)]
*  We can continue the conversation at 7 a.m., yo. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=484.76s)]
*  You guys, there's so much more to talk about regarding- [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=487.56s)]
*  It is amazing to me that all of that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=489.72s)]
*  is happening in L.A. right now. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  And folks are just out there for the BET Awards. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=492.44s)]
*  Like life is normal. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=494.32s)]
*  Like things are just normal. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=496.64s)]
*  Like the backdrop of L.A. is the National Guard [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=497.8s)]
*  being, you know, sicked on protesters. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=500.6s)]
*  No, for real. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=503.04s)]

*  Jess, where were you? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1041.28s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1042.12s)]
*  No, but it was good though. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1044.08s)]
*  Like BET, it's been really good. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1045.28s)]
*  The second day of the radio room, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1047.1999999999998s)]
*  we talked to a lot of media room. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1048.8s)]
*  We talked to a lot of different people. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1049.9199999999998s)]
*  First day was good as well too, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1051.52s)]
*  but second day was my favorite. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1052.52s)]
*  But let's get on into some clips [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1054.12s)]
*  because we talked to a ton of people. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1055.36s)]
*  First up, Jermaine Dupree. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1057.8799999999999s)]
*  We talked to him about 106 and Park and the creation [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1058.84s)]
*  or not of 106 and Park, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1061.6799999999998s)]
*  because they are celebrating 25 years [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1063.1999999999998s)]
*  at the BET Awards tonight. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1065.3999999999999s)]
*  It is now 2025 and people have the conversation [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1067.48s)]
*  about 106 and Park because of what it meant to us [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1070.1999999999998s)]
*  and our homes. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1072.56s)]
*  Did you know when you presented that idea [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1074.8400000000001s)]
*  that 25 years later, we would be talking [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1076.92s)]
*  and holding it the way that we did? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1080.16s)]
*  No. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1081.56s)]
*  Because you create, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1082.4s)]
*  and when I said another awards show, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1083.24s)]
*  another awards season, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1084.08s)]
*  you are a part of so many big iconic moments. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1084.92s)]
*  Yeah, but this probably, I mean, for me and So So Def, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  this is probably one of the biggest, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1090.08s)]
*  because I say, Bow Wow came out in 2000, 2000, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1091.44s)]
*  if I'm not, yeah. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1095.44s)]
*  Bow Wow came out in 2000. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1096.76s)]
*  So this was like, this was the birth of Bow Wow. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1098.04s)]
*  His whole life was seen and raised on, you know, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1102.04s)]
*  BET and 106 and Park. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1106.04s)]
*  Y'all watched him actually grow up from 11 years old [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1108.6s)]
*  to the age he is now. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1112.36s)]
*  You know, something tells me that tonight on that BET stage, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1115.2s)]
*  whoever really created 106 and Park will get the credit [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1117.84s)]
*  for creating 106 and Park. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1120.76s)]
*  And I don't think it's going to be Jermaine. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1122.2s)]
*  Yeah, Bow Wow actually posted, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1123.9199999999998s)]
*  when these clips was going viral, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1126.08s)]
*  remember when Jermaine Dupree [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1127.44s)]
*  was having this conversation before, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1128.32s)]
*  and people was like pissed off that he said that. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1129.36s)]
*  Bow Wow had actually tweeted and said, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1131.76s)]
*  J.D. ain't create 106 and Park, stop the cat. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1133.32s)]
*  Stephen Hill, Rick Grimes, and all the great people [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1136.0s)]
*  in the BET office and staff created that show. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1138.08s)]
*  All I did was capitalize off of what they created [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1141.28s)]
*  and made it mine. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1143.2s)]
*  I would know I am Mr. 106. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1144.08s)]
*  I would never take away from someone's creativity. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  So the story for people that don't know [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1149.28s)]
*  is Jermaine Dupree said he sent the idea to Stephen Hill, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1151.28s)]
*  correct? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1154.72s)]
*  And that's how it was created. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1155.56s)]
*  Yes, and even after Bow Wow came out [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1156.6799999999998s)]
*  with this tweet, Jermaine Dupree had then came back out again [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1159.24s)]
*  and basically said that what he meant was he, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1162.24s)]
*  in conversation, helped to formulate what we became. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1165.76s)]
*  Yeah, the idea of 106 and Park, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1170.3999999999999s)]
*  and then Bow Wow entered the show years later [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1171.84s)]
*  because people were pushing back on it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1175.32s)]
*  But yes. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1176.52s)]
*  We'll find out the name. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1177.36s)]
*  We will, because that tribute tonight on the BET Awards, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1179.3999999999999s)]
*  it's going to be like a whole thing, performances, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1183.1599999999999s)]
*  they're going to bring the different renditions [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1186.0s)]
*  of 106 and Park, including Bow Wow, AJ, Free, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1187.8799999999999s)]
*  all of these people. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1191.36s)]
*  So we'll definitely see who created it [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1192.28s)]
*  and we'll get to relive some of the iconic moments [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1194.1999999999998s)]
*  from the show. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1197.28s)]
*  That's what's up. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1198.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be fire. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1199.04s)]
*  Now another conversation I had during my experience here, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1200.0s)]
*  I sat down and talked to Tamar about the Big Bad Cadillac. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1204.24s)]
*  Hey. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  Loni, well not the- [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1207.72s)]
*  They took my baby, what'd she say? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1208.56s)]
*  The comments that she made about Loni Love. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1210.24s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1211.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, we ain't got that. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1214.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1216.84s)]
*  You got all our staff out there. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1218.52s)]
*  Everybody out there with you. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  All our staff is with you in LA. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1220.2s)]
*  So what we supposed to have here? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1222.44s)]
*  In the meantime, we can go to Jim Jones [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1224.0s)]
*  because y'all know Jim Jones, friend of the room, right? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1226.8s)]
*  Jim. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  Jim literally in the radio room was making rounds [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1230.8s)]
*  and someone texted me and said, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1233.64s)]
*  yo, Sierra just pulled up on Jim Jones [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1234.6000000000001s)]
*  and had some words with him about Chrissy. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1237.0800000000002s)]
*  He was talking to DJ Self and Ivy Rivera [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1238.88s)]
*  for our other Power 105 One family. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1242.76s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Sierra [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1245.0s)]
*  and what she said to Jim Jones. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1247.24s)]
*  Why not? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1249.36s)]
*  Like y'all have like little light in every capacity [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1250.2s)]
*  anyone could live in. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1254.84s)]
*  You live in like, who are you, honey? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1256.48s)]
*  So let's just seal it properly. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1258.92s)]
*  Seal it properly because you know what? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1261.72s)]
*  He deserves it, he deserves it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1264.24s)]
*  Why not? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1267.24s)]
*  Like I look at y'all and I'm like, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1268.24s)]
*  they're so good, they're so fly. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1270.56s)]
*  Chrissy is so beautiful and so dope [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1273.04s)]
*  and she holds you down, like down, down, down. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1275.84s)]
*  Like this is a spirit talking through me right now. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1279.76s)]
*  I'm just saying, like I just, I saw you [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1283.64s)]
*  and I got excited because I love you [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1285.88s)]
*  and you're bringing me to music [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1287.4s)]
*  and what you're bringing to me coming up [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1289.52s)]
*  and also when I see y'all like from a love perspective, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1291.92s)]
*  y'all like so many people, this time. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1295.52s)]
*  I think that was the internet talking through Sierra, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1299.24s)]
*  not no spirit. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1301.04s)]
*  Because that's a huge assumption on her part. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1301.88s)]
*  Like what if Jim and Chrissy don't wanna be married? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1305.8400000000001s)]
*  They already got that understanding. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1308.0s)]
*  So let me get this straight. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1310.16s)]
*  They were interviewing Jim Jones and Sierra [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1311.0s)]
*  was walking by, seeing them and just hopped on? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1312.72s)]
*  Yes, so they were interviewing Jim Jones [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1314.5200000000002s)]
*  and that is exactly what happened. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1317.16s)]
*  Sierra saw the interview and decided to come on in [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1319.0400000000002s)]
*  and actually in the beginning of the interview, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1322.92s)]
*  if you watch the full clip, she says, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1324.3200000000002s)]
*  y'all I know I'm coming in hot, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1326.72s)]
*  but basically like she felt like she needed [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1328.2s)]
*  to get that off her chest and she did. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1329.72s)]
*  Jim didn't respond? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1331.2s)]
*  Jim didn't say nothing. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1332.5600000000002s)]
*  No, he did respond in the interview, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1334.2s)]
*  but he was very respectful with it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1336.0800000000002s)]
*  He just basically told her like, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1337.28s)]
*  you know, I appreciate what you're saying [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1338.28s)]
*  and now let me give you your flowers. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1340.48s)]
*  But more directly, when I spoke to Jim Jones, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  I asked him about the moment and you know, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1343.92s)]
*  he talked about his response. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1346.92s)]
*  So let's take a listen to Jim Jones talking to me. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1348.44s)]
*  Now Jim, I got word over here that Sierra ran down on you. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1350.88s)]
*  Yeah, she did. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1354.64s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1356.0800000000002s)]
*  How was that? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1356.92s)]
*  I mean, I felt like I got scolded [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1357.8000000000002s)]
*  by somebody that was younger than me. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1360.36s)]
*  No, it was good though. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1362.24s)]
*  It was a great piece of advice. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1363.08s)]
*  Honestly, I needed that encouragement. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1364.36s)]
*  I needed to hear that, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1366.52s)]
*  especially for somebody who's active [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1367.36s)]
*  in preaching what she's teaching. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1369.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1371.52s)]
*  Like a lot of people have so many different opinions [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1372.36s)]
*  and they know we're near, you know what I mean? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1374.76s)]
*  Average or in any type of great relationship [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1377.76s)]
*  or any position to give me any type of advice [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1380.52s)]
*  on what I should be doing in my situation. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1382.76s)]
*  And my situation has been going better [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1384.9599999999998s)]
*  than a lot of things that have been going on out here. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1387.08s)]
*  So I ain't pointing no fingers. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1390.4s)]
*  I'm just comfortable in what I'm doing. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1391.3200000000002s)]
*  Like you said, when Chrissy proposed, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1393.92s)]
*  he said, I'm with you, you mean? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1396.2s)]
*  And he's still with you. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1398.68s)]
*  So it's all right. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1400.16s)]
*  You know, maybe they don't want marriage. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1401.72s)]
*  Maybe Chrissy don't want that no more. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1403.88s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1406.2s)]
*  Well, I did try to push him on like, okay, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1407.2800000000002s)]
*  so do we have a date now? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1408.92s)]
*  And let's take a listen to what he said. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1410.2800000000002s)]
*  We gonna get an invite to a wedding? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1412.16s)]
*  Yeah, as soon as we get it together, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1414.24s)]
*  everybody get an invite. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1416.5200000000002s)]
*  As soon as we get it together, everybody get an invite. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1417.96s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1420.72s)]
*  How you ask him if there's a date when he, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1421.56s)]
*  the question just happened 10 seconds ago. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1423.9199999999998s)]
*  Do you remember the year Chrissy proposed, Envy? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1425.96s)]
*  I remember that episode. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1428.68s)]
*  It was like 2011, 2012, it was 2011. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1429.52s)]
*  So what does that mean, Lauren? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1432.24s)]
*  That's a long time ago. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1433.56s)]
*  I feel like if they was gonna have a date by now [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1434.76s)]
*  that they wanted to publicly put out there, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1436.8799999999999s)]
*  he would have at least known how to throw me a time range. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1438.56s)]
*  So either they don't wanna discuss it or- [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1441.04s)]
*  If they had a date, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1442.84s)]
*  Sierra wouldn't have had to roll up on him and say that, Lauren. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1443.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1445.6s)]
*  No, I think honestly, I feel like with them, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1446.44s)]
*  maybe it's something that they just don't want us to know [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1448.36s)]
*  or something like, what if they've already done this? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1450.48s)]
*  You would know, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1453.56s)]
*  because I'm sure you did your Googles [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1454.3999999999999s)]
*  and I'm sure you went to a court doc, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  you know all that already. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1456.76s)]
*  It would be public knowledge. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1457.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1459.36s)]
*  Well, in New York, it's a little bit difficult, but we'll- [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1460.76s)]
*  See, she tried, see? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1462.84s)]
*  I knew it, she tried. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1464.0s)]
*  No, I did not, not to know, not here, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1465.32s)]
*  not while I'm trying to get the rest [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1467.12s)]
*  to come on here and talk to y'all. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1469.32s)]
*  But anyway, we don't have time for another clip. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1470.48s)]
*  So I'm gonna remind you guys, and then maybe we'll, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1473.68s)]
*  not maybe, we'll bring this back in the next hour [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1475.76s)]
*  because I do want y'all to hear what Tamar had to say [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1477.4s)]
*  to Lonnie Love after she made those comments, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1479.76s)]
*  but about the big back Cadillac. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1482.96s)]
*  But tonight, Monday, June 9th, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1485.4s)]

*  And I'll be backstage actually at the awards [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1501.44s)]
*  doing some content. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1503.8000000000002s)]
*  So we'll get some of that as well too. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1504.88s)]

*  Morning everybody, it's DJ Envy, Jess Hilarious, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1522.3999999999999s)]
*  Charlamagne the guy. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1525.7199999999998s)]
*  We are The Breakfast Club. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1526.56s)]
*  Let's get back in some front page news. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  Now yesterday was game two of the NBA finals. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1531.1599999999999s)]
*  OKC beat the Pacers 123 to 107. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1533.4s)]
*  Does Indiana win another game? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1538.52s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1540.88s)]
*  When OKC is locked in, it's like night and day. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1542.3200000000002s)]
*  They're not even on the same planet as the Pacers, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1544.72s)]
*  but it's really up to the OKC and their focus. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1547.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so, but we'll see what happens. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1549.92s)]
*  What up Morgan? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1552.2s)]
*  Hey y'all, hey. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1553.64s)]
*  So the conversation on ICE raids and immigration continues. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1554.48s)]
*  Former Vice President Kamala Harris says she is appalled [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1557.26s)]
*  by what is taking place in Los Angeles, California. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1560.0400000000002s)]
*  She's saying the Trump administration's actions [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1562.76s)]
*  are about stoking fear and not about public safety. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1564.64s)]
*  In case you missed it, there has been ICE protests [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1568.64s)]
*  in Los Angeles that have been erupting over the weekend. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1571.92s)]
*  And Harris said in a social media statement [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1574.68s)]
*  that deploying the National Guard [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1577.32s)]
*  was a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1578.72s)]
*  She went on to add that along with recent ICE raids [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1582.0s)]
*  in Southern California and nationwide, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1584.74s)]
*  the move is part of the Trump administration's [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1587.3600000000001s)]
*  cruel calculated agenda to spread panic and division. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1589.44s)]
*  But as of right now, so downtown Los Angeles [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1593.68s)]
*  has been declared an unlawful assembly [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1595.6000000000001s)]
*  with police ordering anti-ICE protesters [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1597.8000000000002s)]
*  to leave the area immediately as of late yesterday evening. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1600.2s)]
*  So of course I will keep you updated on that. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1604.44s)]
*  Switching gears and we'll still on the topic of immigration. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1607.24s)]
*  There's even been reports of TikTok star, Kabila May. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1610.92s)]
*  You know the guy who's most known [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1613.8400000000001s)]
*  for not saying a word in his video [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1616.0s)]
*  and he tends to do hand gestures like that. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1617.8s)]
*  Well, he's an Italian national by way of Senegal [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1621.32s)]
*  and he's actually been deported after overstaying his visa. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1624.68s)]
*  So damn. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1628.4s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what, man, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1629.8s)]
*  when they say cases like that, you know, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1631.32s)]
*  people get outraged, but it's like he did overstay his visa. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1633.44s)]
*  So if you know that you're dealing with an administration [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1637.08s)]
*  that is super strict on that type of stuff, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1639.28s)]
*  you gotta be on top of that type of business. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1641.16s)]
*  That's like driving with a suspended license, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1643.04s)]
*  knowing your license is suspended. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1645.0s)]
*  Or you know, your passport is expired something. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  That's up to you to fix. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1649.1999999999998s)]
*  Then when you get pulled over, you're like, oh man. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1650.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1652.84s)]
*  Man, that's up to you to fix. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1653.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, it sucks, but you gotta stay on top of your business. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1656.28s)]
*  There are rules. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1659.76s)]
*  Speaking of staying on top of the business of immigration, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1661.0s)]
*  the man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1663.76s)]
*  and became a flash point of President Trump's [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1666.36s)]
*  immigration policy is back in the United States [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1668.8799999999999s)]
*  to face criminal charges. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1671.1599999999999s)]
*  A US attorney general, Pam Bondi says, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1672.84s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego-Garcia will be charged with human trafficking. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1675.2s)]
*  Let's take a listen to her comments. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1679.1200000000001s)]
*  The grand jury found that over the past nine years, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1681.48s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia has played a significant role [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1685.6000000000001s)]
*  in an alien smuggling ring. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1689.48s)]
*  Thousands of illegal aliens were smuggled. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1692.8000000000002s)]
*  This is especially disturbing because Abrego-Garcia [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1696.52s)]
*  is also alleged with transporting minor children. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1701.12s)]
*  Yeah, so Abrego-Garcia was sent to prison in El Salvador [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1705.36s)]
*  from Maryland on what the Trump administration [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1708.08s)]
*  originally said was an administrative error, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1710.84s)]
*  but later said he was a member of the MS-13 gang. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1713.04s)]
*  Now Bondi said Abrego-Garcia made over 100 human [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1715.72s)]
*  smuggling trips into the US and will be returned [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1719.56s)]
*  to El Salvador once he's found guilty. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1722.24s)]
*  Now Abrego-Garcia, of course he was a rallying point [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1724.0s)]
*  for Democrats opposed to Trump's illegal immigration [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1726.48s)]
*  saying he was deported without due process. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1729.68s)]
*  And it does appear that now he's getting [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1732.0800000000002s)]
*  that so-called due process. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1734.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you know what's interesting is how all weekend [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1736.24s)]
*  that's been like a C or D story, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1738.2s)]
*  but there was a time it was an A story, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1740.0400000000002s)]
*  but now that he's back going through due process, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1741.88s)]
*  the conversation doesn't seem as loud. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1744.2s)]
*  Why do we think that is? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1746.0400000000002s)]
*  Is it because they hit him [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1746.88s)]
*  with the human trafficking charges? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1747.72s)]
*  And so now everybody that was- [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1749.0s)]
*  They found something. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1751.2s)]
*  So it's like, I don't know. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1752.0400000000002s)]
*  So is everybody taking a step back like, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1754.24s)]
*  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute now. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1755.48s)]
*  Well, not me, you know, I'ma definitely keep you, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1757.16s)]
*  like I said, I'ma keep you posted, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1758.84s)]
*  but I'm not sure why it doesn't, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1760.04s)]
*  I mean, maybe the bigger story right now is the protest [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1762.9199999999998s)]
*  and addressing that. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1766.32s)]
*  But the sad part about it is it's all relative. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1768.96s)]
*  You know, it's like, it's all related. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1771.48s)]
*  All of these stories are connected [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  in the topic of immigration. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1775.68s)]
*  But we can switch gears on that [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1779.36s)]
*  and talk about this upcoming military parade [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1780.8799999999999s)]
*  that's happening here in Washington, DC. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1782.72s)]
*  So the army is preparing for the largest military parade [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1784.52s)]
*  in Washington, DC that DC has seen in decades. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1787.32s)]
*  In an event President Trump has been pushing [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1791.3999999999999s)]
*  since his first term in office. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1794.4399999999998s)]
*  This will mark the army's 250th birthday [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1796.6s)]
*  and also President Trump's birthday as well and Flag Day. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1799.6s)]
*  Let's take a listen to President Trump [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1802.76s)]
*  talk about this upcoming military parade on Saturday. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1804.6799999999998s)]
*  I am thrilled to invite everyone [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1808.48s)]
*  to an unforgettable celebration, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1811.0s)]
*  one like you've never seen before. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1813.56s)]
*  On Saturday, June 14th, which is Flag Day, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1815.52s)]
*  we are honoring the 250th anniversary [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1819.0s)]
*  of the greatest fighting force in history, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1822.28s)]
*  the United States Army. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1824.8799999999999s)]
*  For two and a half centuries, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1826.52s)]
*  the men and women of America's army [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1828.2s)]
*  have dominated our enemies [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1831.04s)]
*  and protected our freedom at home. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1832.84s)]
*  So the celebration is expected [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1834.96s)]
*  to bring seven million pounds of hardware. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1836.44s)]
*  And this week, road reinforcement has been underway in DC [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1839.68s)]
*  to protect the sum of DC's infrastructure during the event. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1843.6s)]
*  We do expect that there will be some damage, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1847.8s)]
*  which I believe, I'm not sure if it's the National Guard [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1850.56s)]
*  or someone agreed to pay for it. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1853.12s)]
*  Nearly 7,000 soldiers are set to participate [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1855.04s)]
*  and the parade will take place on June 14th [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1857.9199999999998s)]
*  with dozens of tanks, fighting vehicles, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1860.24s)]
*  howitzers and other artillery pieces. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1863.0s)]
*  Just on the- [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1867.0s)]
*  Wasteful spending, wasteful spending. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1867.84s)]
*  How much is that parade gonna cost? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1869.9199999999998s)]
*  Now that's wasteful spending. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1871.4399999999998s)]
*  Millions and millions. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1872.76s)]
*  But you know, it's kind of a stark contrast [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1875.32s)]
*  from the fact that we just had Pride Weekend this past weekend [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1877.88s)]
*  and now this upcoming weekend, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1880.84s)]
*  we can anticipate having this military parade in DC. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1882.52s)]
*  And if we got time for one more, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1886.8s)]
*  I think we could have a- [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1888.08s)]
*  provide an- I wanna provide you guys with an update [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1889.72s)]
*  regarding this Elon Musk and Trump beef. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1891.76s)]
*  So apparently President Trump [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1893.44s)]
*  is threatening serious consequences [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1895.2s)]
*  if tech billionaire Elon Musk begins funding Democrats. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1897.32s)]
*  So he made those comments in an interview with NBC News, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1900.44s)]
*  amid a public feud, of course, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1903.0800000000002s)]
*  with Musk that took place over the last few weeks. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1904.72s)]
*  Now Trump said Musk will pay the price [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1907.16s)]
*  if he funds Democratic candidates [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1909.6000000000001s)]
*  to challenge Republicans who support the GOP's big, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1911.8000000000002s)]
*  so-called big, beautiful bill. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1915.68s)]
*  And the president did not specify [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1917.16s)]
*  what those consequences would be, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1918.72s)]
*  but he did go on to say that he doesn't have any intention [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1920.2s)]
*  of speaking with Musk and he assumes his relationship [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1923.24s)]
*  with the billionaire is officially over. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1926.44s)]
*  Back in February on my Brain Idiots podcast, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1928.76s)]
*  I was saying how Donald Trump and Elon Musk, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1932.0s)]
*  it's inevitable for them to have this type of falling out, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1934.96s)]
*  but there's something in there that I told people [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1937.88s)]
*  I would un-bleep when it happens. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1940.52s)]
*  I said what I think is gonna happen [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1943.16s)]
*  and then I bleeped it on purpose. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1944.56s)]
*  Boy, are we getting closer to me un-bleeping it. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1946.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1948.28s)]
*  You just wait. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1949.1200000000001s)]
*  Damn. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1950.24s)]
*  You just wait. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1951.08s)]
*  He said you called it the prophetess. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1951.92s)]
*  You'll see when I un-bleep it. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1952.96s)]
*  I see it coming. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=1954.92s)]

*  Girl. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2002.76s)]
*  When you followed me back on Instagram, I cried. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2003.6s)]
*  Oh, are you serious? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2005.2s)]
*  Not like ugly cry, but I was just, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2006.64s)]
*  I called John and I was like, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2007.92s)]
*  she just followed me back on Instagram. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2009.08s)]
*  Like, oh my God. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2010.48s)]

*  and go, I wanna be like you. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2020.1599999999999s)]
*  Somebody just told her that. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2021.48s)]
*  Yeah, somebody just told her that. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2022.6s)]
*  Oh, for real? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2023.4399999999998s)]
*  Like literally three minutes ago. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2024.28s)]
*  Well, God is trying to tell you something. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2025.72s)]
*  I hear him. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2027.84s)]
*  You better receive it then. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2028.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but I hear him. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2029.5s)]
*  Why nobody ever do that to me? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2030.34s)]
*  I never get confirmation like that. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2031.4399999999998s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2032.28s)]
*  I was on my way. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2033.12s)]
*  I was on my way to tell you. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2033.9399999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2035.4399999999998s)]
*  For me, I remember your, not the transition, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2036.32s)]
*  but when you first stepped into the role on the show. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2038.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2040.72s)]
*  And there was a lot going on and a lot being said. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2041.56s)]
*  But you handled it really gracefully. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2043.4s)]
*  What show now? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2044.76s)]
*  When she was sharing the show. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2045.6000000000001s)]
*  You had your usage. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2047.0400000000002s)]
*  You fed her. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2048.88s)]
*  Look at you. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2049.7200000000003s)]
*  What you want from me? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2050.64s)]
*  When it went from the Wendy Show to the Sherri Shepherd Show. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2052.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2055.04s)]
*  You have your own supportive view, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2055.88s)]
*  but there was a lot of conversation that was happening. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2058.04s)]
*  But the way that you handled it, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2059.92s)]
*  I thought was you handled it very well. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2060.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2063.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, it's easy. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2064.0s)]
*  Life is too short. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2065.12s)]
*  You gotta know what energy you walking in [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2065.96s)]
*  and create your own energy. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2068.08s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2070.2400000000002s)]
*  And it worked out. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2071.08s)]
*  Where in your life did you learn that? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2071.92s)]
*  Because it was loud. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2074.08s)]
*  Yeah, but I think from being on The View, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2075.3199999999997s)]
*  that's why I learned how to get the criticism. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2077.72s)]
*  Cause I learned, you know, Joy Behar said, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2079.52s)]
*  when you have this kind of platform, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2082.2s)]
*  when you open up your mouth, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2084.12s)]
*  half the world is going to hate you. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2085.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2086.8799999999997s)]
*  So you know, so you stop trying to chase validation [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2087.72s)]
*  because I would go on this site. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2091.3599999999997s)]
*  It was a site called, I Hate Talkshows. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2093.12s)]
*  And I would go in there to see what they said about me. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2095.6s)]
*  And then they would say, oh, Sherri's doing this. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2097.7999999999997s)]
*  She didn't even mention this. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2099.52s)]
*  So I would mention it the next time. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2100.52s)]
*  They go, did you see how conceited she was [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2102.16s)]
*  when she mentioned this? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2104.0s)]
*  You can't win. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2105.12s)]
*  No. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2105.96s)]
*  Who told you to stop reading the comments? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2106.7999999999997s)]
*  I know somebody had to pull you to stop. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2108.12s)]
*  Whoopi. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2109.44s)]
*  Whoopi's like, stop reading all that stuff. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2110.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't care about you. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2111.48s)]
*  So I stopped. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2112.92s)]
*  But what I realized is nobody's sending me money [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2113.7599999999998s)]
*  to take care of my son. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2116.48s)]
*  Nobody is offering to help me when I'm going through it. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2117.7599999999998s)]
*  Nobody, you got your diehards that'll pray for you. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2120.48s)]
*  So why am I listening to all, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2122.52s)]
*  this is chatter from people who probably, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2123.92s)]
*  when they come at you on social media, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2126.56s)]
*  they want to do what you're doing. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2128.64s)]
*  They just don't want to put in that work. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2130.16s)]
*  That's what Kevin Hart says. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2132.6s)]
*  And it's so true. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2133.56s)]
*  Where have you heard that from, Laura? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2134.56s)]
*  You. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2136.12s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2136.96s)]
*  All the time? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2137.7999999999997s)]
*  You never said that to me, Charlemagne. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2138.64s)]
*  I didn't know you said that. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2139.48s)]
*  I never knew that was your, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2140.92s)]
*  that was your motto for life. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2141.92s)]
*  You do a lot of talking, but you never said that. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2143.8799999999997s)]
*  But I'm the same way. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2147.64s)]
*  I'm like, yo, stop reading the comments. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2148.48s)]
*  Like, why? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2149.96s)]
*  Don't. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2150.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, you read the comments? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2151.64s)]
*  I don't go looking for the comments. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2152.46s)]
*  But no, I don't. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2153.48s)]
*  No, I do not. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2154.68s)]
*  But every now and then, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2155.52s)]
*  You just want to see what people. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2156.7599999999998s)]
*  But I also, like, for what I do, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2158.04s)]
*  I have to kind of know what people are talking about. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2159.84s)]
*  Why, what are the angles, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2162.4s)]
*  do they care how we dive in and what I'm talking about? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2163.56s)]
*  Yeah, you read them. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2165.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's hard now. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2166.56s)]
*  You just have to be discerning. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2167.8s)]
*  Cause I read my comments. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2169.28s)]
*  Because sometimes people are very, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2170.44s)]
*  they have really good critiques. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2171.96s)]
*  Some people are commenting, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2173.2400000000002s)]
*  Shira, you talk a mile a minute. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2174.6800000000003s)]
*  I can't understand what you're saying. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2175.98s)]
*  So I learned to slow down. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2177.6400000000003s)]
*  Then those people who go, you ain't cute. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2179.7200000000003s)]
*  You ain't got no hips. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2181.56s)]
*  You ain't got no, or you gonna, you know, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2182.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't pay attention to that. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2185.84s)]
*  Cause you look at it for what it is. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2187.1600000000003s)]
*  You gotta have your own self worth. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2189.4s)]
*  So you do, it's just discern what is edifying, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2190.56s)]
*  what is going to help you. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2193.64s)]
*  The other stuff you throw out. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2195.0s)]
*  It means nothing. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2196.52s)]
*  Even your topics on your show. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2197.44s)]
*  Cause that was another thing as well too. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2198.84s)]
*  Like people were upset when you talked about [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2200.28s)]
*  Meg Thee Stallion on the carpet and her being, you know, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2202.4s)]
*  nude or whatever you called her, right? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2205.36s)]
*  And people respond to that. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2207.64s)]
*  And when that happens, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2208.76s)]
*  Yeah, for that, when I said that about Meg, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2210.4s)]
*  I was ready for the backlash. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2212.56s)]
*  But I am, I'm a mother. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2214.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm a woman. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2216.0s)]
*  I mentor girls. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2216.84s)]
*  And I just go, at some point we have a responsibility. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2218.28s)]
*  We have to speak up. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2221.88s)]
*  And I love Meg Thee Stallion. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2223.1600000000003s)]
*  I love it. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2225.32s)]
*  But I think that women are going too far. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2226.6000000000004s)]
*  And sometimes we forget that there are people [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2230.0800000000004s)]
*  who are watching us and they can't do what we do. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2232.2400000000002s)]
*  They don't have security. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2235.0800000000004s)]
*  They can't walk around and say, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2236.6000000000004s)]
*  I want to do the same thing. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2238.1200000000003s)]
*  So we also, we are our brother's keeper. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2239.7200000000003s)]
*  To whom much is given, much is required. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2241.96s)]
*  So I knew I was going to backlash. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2243.84s)]
*  They told me, you know, you're going to get, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2246.2400000000002s)]
*  and I said, but no, no, I got to stand up. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2247.68s)]
*  I got this platform and it's really important that I say it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2249.3999999999996s)]
*  And if you listen to the context of what I said, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2252.9199999999996s)]
*  people look at you because you have a degree. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2256.48s)]
*  You went and graduated. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2258.3999999999996s)]
*  You didn't just let it go. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2260.04s)]
*  So you inspire girls to want to go to college, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2261.24s)]
*  but also over here, you inspire girls to want to do this. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2263.8399999999997s)]
*  And I named other women who do it too. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2266.24s)]
*  So I got this platform for a reason and I know what it is. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2268.44s)]
*  And I try to use it wisely. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2271.56s)]
*  Now, so you grown. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2273.48s)]
*  So being that you grown, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2274.6s)]
*  people should listen to their elders. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2275.8399999999997s)]
*  What happened to that? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2278.36s)]
*  We used to listen to our elders. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2279.2s)]
*  They don't do that now. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2280.04s)]
*  They don't do that now. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2280.88s)]
*  They like you old. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2281.72s)]
*  Like you don't know. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2283.24s)]
*  That was one of the pushbacks. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2284.08s)]
*  That's what I was going to ask you. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2284.92s)]
*  Like, I know you're intentional with the topics [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2285.7599999999998s)]
*  that you choose, but when you get pushbacks, like, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2286.92s)]
*  oh, this is an age thing. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2288.48s)]
*  It's because you're older. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2289.64s)]
*  She don't understand. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2290.6s)]
*  She act like she didn't have her day. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2291.64s)]
*  Like those type of things. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2292.88s)]
*  I have a lot of grades. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2295.32s)]
*  I know, you know, there were things that we did [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2296.24s)]
*  when we were young and you know, and I do, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2298.4s)]
*  but also, you know what the assignment is. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2300.08s)]
*  There's an assignment on your life. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2302.2s)]
*  There's an assignment that you've been given [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2303.8s)]
*  and you got to carry it out. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2306.0s)]
*  And it's just stuff that comes with this position [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2307.36s)]
*  that you're in. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2309.52s)]
*  It is going to come. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2310.36s)]
*  You can't escape it. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2311.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2312.2400000000002s)]
*  So just don't. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2313.08s)]
*  When you came in there today, you said your son [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2313.92s)]
*  just texted you and said, mom, I have all for school today [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2315.48s)]
*  and I have nothing to do. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2318.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2319.92s)]
*  And he's 20 years old. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2320.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2321.76s)]
*  That's not what she said. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2322.6s)]
*  That is part of what she said. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2323.44s)]
*  But get to what she really said. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2324.28s)]
*  But then you said that your son also said he wants to smoke. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2325.96s)]
*  He wants to smoke some marijuana, some cannabis. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2328.2s)]
*  Yes, because that's what everybody talks about at school. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2330.28s)]
*  You know, they talk about that. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2332.88s)]
*  And so that's one of his things. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2334.32s)]
*  He came, I was doing my podcast with Ken Whitley, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2336.48s)]
*  two funny mommas. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2338.96s)]
*  He came and he was like, I want to talk to you. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2339.8s)]
*  And that's what he was going to the basketball center. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2341.2000000000003s)]
*  And he said, you know, when can I get high? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2343.8s)]
*  First of all, it's amazing that he came to you [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2347.52s)]
*  and feel comfortable to tell you. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2349.2000000000003s)]
*  I love that he comes to me. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2350.0400000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2351.6000000000004s)]
*  And what did you tell him? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2352.44s)]
*  But he comes to me and I don't know nothing. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2353.28s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2354.52s)]
*  And he was just like, I'm a single mom. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2355.6000000000004s)]
*  He was like, you know, I want to, when can I do this? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2357.48s)]
*  And I was sitting here praying and speaking in tongues. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2360.6000000000004s)]
*  And I said, when you 24, he asked me that when he was like 19 [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2363.08s)]
*  or 18, that's just the number that came to my head, Envy. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2366.44s)]
*  I'm a single mother. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2369.52s)]
*  Yeah, because like it's too much. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2370.52s)]
*  Like I still look at my son as like my baby, a 14 year old. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2372.44s)]
*  So when he came and was asking these questions about, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2376.84s)]
*  you know, when can you go and see, you know, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2379.28s)]
*  women dancing and stuff. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2381.32s)]
*  And I didn't know what to say. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2382.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2384.4s)]
*  So I said 24. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2385.28s)]
*  That's just the number that came to my head. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2386.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2387.96s)]
*  The person who does my hair, Theo, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2389.44s)]
*  he has locks in his hair. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2390.68s)]
*  So when my son saw him, he said, he immediately said, [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2392.28s)]
*  do you get high? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2395.0800000000004s)]
*  And- [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2396.28s)]
*  Aerotyping, profiles. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2397.1200000000003s)]
*  Profiles. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2397.96s)]
*  Profiles in the bathroom. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2398.8s)]
*  But here's what happened. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2399.8s)]
*  Theo looked at him and was like, oh yeah. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2400.6400000000003s)]
*  So, but so I said, well, I wanted to have the experience [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2402.76s)]
*  of I said, well, maybe if they put the medicine [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2407.92s)]
*  to make you go to the bathroom, the diarrhea medicine [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2410.7200000000003s)]
*  in the brownie, that way when he does it, he'll, you know, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2413.8s)]
*  just have diarrhea and then you won't want to do it again. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2418.0800000000004s)]
*  That's what everybody say. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2421.52s)]
*  Like you give them so much liquor that they get sick. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2422.48s)]
*  No, give them some sativa, some high grade sativa. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2425.12s)]
*  And what is that? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2428.7200000000003s)]
*  What if he- [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2429.56s)]
*  The kind that induces panic attacks [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2430.4s)]
*  and makes him so paranoid and so scared. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2432.16s)]
*  I don't want him to have panic attacks. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2433.0s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2434.2000000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2435.04s)]
*  That will make him not want to do it again. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2435.88s)]
*  That, not the diarrhea. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2437.4s)]

*  And I don't want him to have a panic. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2441.68s)]
*  I just want him to die real. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2443.52s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2444.64s)]
*  No, not the diarrhea. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2445.48s)]
*  He'll think he'll fly. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2446.32s)]
*  You'll see him on Madison Avenue trying to fly over cars [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2447.16s)]
*  or something. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2448.28s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2449.12s)]
*  Don't make him not want to do it. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2449.96s)]
*  I promise you. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2451.4s)]
*  Okay, panic attacks. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2452.2400000000002s)]
*  I would do that. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2453.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2453.92s)]
*  Yeah, Envy's saying no, Lauren's saying no. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2454.76s)]
*  When did you first get high? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2456.64s)]
*  I don't think you should do it. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2457.64s)]
*  When I first got high, I think I was like 18, 17. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2458.48s)]
*  So why you gotta wait till 24? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2461.8s)]
*  Because that's, look I am a single mom. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2463.44s)]
*  This is hard. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2465.32s)]
*  You don't understand. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2466.16s)]
*  I'm not a man. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2467.6s)]
*  This is where I get mad when I go, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2468.92s)]
*  I need some men to come in and help me [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2470.36s)]
*  because I don't know what to say to him. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2472.8s)]
*  I don't get high. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2475.28s)]
*  So when he came to me and was saying that, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2476.48s)]
*  I was just like, I didn't know what to say. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2478.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2480.92s)]
*  The judgment, I don't like Charlamagne. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2482.04s)]
*  That's why I was so mad. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2484.16s)]
*  When he's 24, me and Uncle Charlo take him [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2485.68s)]
*  to Atlanta strip club, mad city. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2487.72s)]

*  I won't even look. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2495.68s)]
*  I'll just close my eyes. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2496.7599999999998s)]
*  I bet you would never say that in Bad Boy Records. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2497.96s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2500.8399999999997s)]

*  No. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2504.2s)]

*  That was a good one. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2506.72s)]
*  It was real good too. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2507.8799999999997s)]
*  Wowzer. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2508.72s)]
*  Wowzer. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2509.56s)]
*  Does anybody have my subpoena papers ready [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2510.3999999999996s)]
*  for me to take out on the court? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2511.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2513.16s)]
*  So we're still kicking it with Sherri Shepherd. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2514.56s)]
*  Lauren. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2516.4399999999996s)]
*  What things do you deal with on your own [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2517.2799999999997s)]
*  with your son that you're like, man. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2519.0s)]
*  All of that trying to teach him how to be a man. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2520.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't know how to be a man because I'm not a man. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2522.56s)]
*  I'm not, I don't espouse that belief of, you know, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2524.3599999999997s)]
*  I can be everything for you. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2527.6s)]
*  I can be, you don't need no daddy. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2529.04s)]
*  You don't know, you need a man in your life. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2531.04s)]
*  A boy needs a man. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2534.2s)]
*  Especially in this day and age, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2535.68s)]
*  a young black boy needs a black man. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2537.24s)]
*  Cause man, what they do to my son, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2539.56s)]
*  cause he's, I'm not allowed to say his name. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2541.56s)]
*  He told me don't talk about him. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2542.96s)]
*  But what they do to my son is they say, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2544.2799999999997s)]
*  look, look at me in the eye, shake my hand. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2545.6s)]
*  You know, give me your deepest voice when you talk to me. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2548.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know how to say that. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2551.8799999999997s)]
*  What he gets from me now is he's like, you always, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2553.04s)]
*  like you keep nagging. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2555.04s)]
*  Cause I feel like I only got maybe 12 minutes [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2556.52s)]
*  to give him the rest of life's lessons. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2559.3599999999997s)]
*  And he's like, you told me already. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2561.9199999999996s)]
*  And so I think with mothers and boys, as they get older, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2563.52s)]
*  there's a frustration. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2566.76s)]
*  That's why they keep wanting to pull away. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2567.72s)]
*  They're longing from that male energy. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2569.68s)]
*  So when he's around, when he's around my glam team, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2572.96s)]
*  he likes being with them. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2575.0s)]
*  Cause they're just men. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2576.32s)]
*  Are you dating? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2577.72s)]
*  I'm single. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2578.64s)]
*  So I'm just, I'm out here. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2579.48s)]
*  I'm open. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2580.32s)]
*  Open to her. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2581.52s)]
*  I know your DM's crazy. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2582.36s)]
*  I can do what you be. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2583.2s)]
*  I never go on my DM's. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2584.12s)]
*  So I don't, I really don't go on my DM's. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2585.04s)]
*  Cause the last time it was somebody didn't have no finger. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2587.44s)]
*  So it was missing the third digit. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2589.88s)]
*  So I don't. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2591.36s)]
*  What happened? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2593.16s)]
*  Let me tell you one, something that's a deal breaker. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2594.4399999999996s)]
*  When you're missing digits, I need you to have a finger. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2596.64s)]
*  How you know he ain't had no fingers? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2599.3199999999997s)]
*  Because he was in it. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2600.52s)]
*  I went to his profile and I looked [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2601.3599999999997s)]
*  and he didn't have no finger. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2604.0s)]
*  Which finger though? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2605.7999999999997s)]
*  He was the third finger. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2606.7999999999997s)]
*  Not that you, you don't know if you really need [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2608.6s)]
*  your third finger till you ain't got your third finger. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2610.4399999999996s)]
*  What if this man was good looking, had a nice career, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2612.8799999999997s)]
*  was a great man. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2617.2799999999997s)]
*  He was going to be the love of your life. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2618.16s)]
*  And you, cause you don't got a finger? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2619.48s)]
*  You don't have a finger. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2620.96s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2623.04s)]
*  Not having a finger. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2623.88s)]
*  Cause you need all 10 of your fingers. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2624.72s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2626.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm happy I got mine. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2627.12s)]
*  If you want to caress my neck and you ain't got that finger, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2627.96s)]
*  I feel emptiness. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2631.24s)]
*  But we're talking, that's only on one hand though, right? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2632.3599999999997s)]
*  You know what? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2635.3199999999997s)]
*  Once I saw the finger was missing, Lauren, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2636.16s)]
*  I just didn't stay. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2637.6s)]
*  That was God testing you. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2638.64s)]
*  That was God testing you. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2639.7599999999998s)]
*  But it does, as you get in this season, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2642.16s)]
*  it's different now. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2643.92s)]
*  Now I'm not looking at potential. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2645.16s)]
*  When I was in my twenties, it was about, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2647.04s)]
*  oh, he got potential. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2648.68s)]
*  I don't look at potential. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2650.72s)]
*  You have to be living in your dream. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2652.8s)]
*  It has to be your reality. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2656.12s)]
*  You have to be a certain financial and a financial place [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2657.16s)]
*  because I'm not here trying to help you move forward. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2661.7200000000003s)]
*  So it just changes. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2665.64s)]
*  If I bring you into my space, you can't be intimidated. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2667.92s)]
*  You can't be like looking at it around going, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2671.64s)]
*  well, there ain't nothing I can do. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2673.7200000000003s)]
*  So it just changes a little bit. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2675.64s)]
*  So how was shooting Straw? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2679.2s)]
*  I know you loved it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2680.56s)]
*  You were four days shooting, you're right back in it. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2681.56s)]
*  No, no, I didn't shoot. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2682.88s)]
*  I was six days. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2684.12s)]
*  Oh, you were six days. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2684.96s)]
*  You were six days. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2685.8s)]
*  Taraji was four. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2686.88s)]
*  You were six. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2687.7200000000003s)]
*  Taraji was four because she was doing Fight Night [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2688.56s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2689.96s)]
*  And Tiana was also doing a movie at the same time. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2691.04s)]
*  I was the only one that had time. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2694.04s)]
*  So mine was six days. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2695.92s)]
*  I had a ball. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2697.48s)]
*  It was a different experience stepping [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2699.32s)]
*  into the Tyler Perry world. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2701.32s)]
*  Break it down. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2703.76s)]
*  Because I'm used to doing a movie [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2704.64s)]
*  and it'll take weeks to do. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2707.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm on location for a number of weeks. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2710.0s)]
*  So even when Tyler had asked me and I wasn't available, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2712.32s)]
*  I said, well, I'm trying to work it out. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2715.56s)]
*  How many weeks do you need me? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2716.52s)]
*  He said, I don't need you for, I need you for five days. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2717.52s)]
*  And I had never heard that before [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2720.52s)]
*  because I was one of the stars of the movie. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2722.92s)]
*  But with Tyler, he's got a world that he lives in. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2725.84s)]
*  He's real, he knows what he wants. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2728.72s)]
*  He has a lot of cameras covering you. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2731.12s)]
*  So when you go to a movie, they do a master shot. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2734.0s)]
*  You know, you go back and you wait till they turn it around [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2736.48s)]
*  and do a single shot. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2738.68s)]
*  Then they got to turn those cameras around [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2740.92s)]
*  and do the other shot. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2741.76s)]
*  Then they got to get a wide shot. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2742.7200000000003s)]
*  Then they got to get a close up. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2744.36s)]
*  And you're doing maybe three pages in a whole day. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2745.7200000000003s)]
*  Tyler does not do that. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2749.12s)]
*  He has a ton of cameras in and they're catching shots. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2750.6s)]
*  So when I'm looking at the movie, they caught shots of me. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2754.92s)]
*  I didn't even realize because it was so many cameras. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2757.0s)]
*  So he can do 10 or 12 pages in a day. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2759.48s)]
*  But he knows what he wants and he gets it done. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2763.36s)]
*  And Tyler's a man of his word. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2766.56s)]
*  I remember y'all, this had to be like maybe four or five [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2767.72s)]
*  months ago, you was asking him to put you in, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2770.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know if it was a specific movie [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2773.04s)]
*  or was it why did I get married? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2774.16s)]
*  I just remember you asking him to be in something. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2775.2799999999997s)]
*  I ask everybody who comes if they could put me on something. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2777.0s)]
*  He really put you in? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2779.24s)]
*  And he put me in the movie. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2780.08s)]
*  He called me, he said, I have this part [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2781.08s)]
*  and I want you to do it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2782.8399999999997s)]
*  And it conflicted with the talk show. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2784.04s)]
*  You can't really take off, but they moved it around. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2786.8799999999997s)]
*  I said, I don't care who sits in my in the chair. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2789.3999999999996s)]
*  I need to do this movie. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2791.52s)]
*  And we ended my show a week early so I could go and do it. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2793.2s)]
*  Let me tell you something about Tyler Perry. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2797.96s)]
*  He takes care of you. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2799.56s)]
*  Now everybody talks about the money he pays you. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2800.96s)]
*  Yes, but in terms of, I walked into my trailer. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2803.2s)]
*  You have to negotiate your trailer size from the front. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2806.68s)]
*  Everything is negotiation. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2810.48s)]
*  And I always negotiate, I get one less of what the star gets. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2812.4s)]
*  So I get a big trailer, but I walked in my trailer [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2818.84s)]
*  and I said, is Brad Pitt doing the movie too? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2821.4s)]
*  I walked in my trailer. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2824.36s)]
*  It was a double staircase. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2825.48s)]
*  I had a kitchen, I had an office. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2827.12s)]
*  I had a full kitchen. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2829.16s)]
*  I tried to, I was like, if I could take this refrigerator. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2831.32s)]
*  It was a full size refrigerator. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2833.84s)]
*  It was a bedroom. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2835.84s)]
*  It was a walk-in closet. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2837.16s)]
*  I had a living room, a family room recline. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2839.32s)]
*  I was like, I cried. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2841.96s)]
*  I've never had in my wildest dreams. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2843.6s)]
*  I never imagined something like that. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2846.56s)]
*  You know, where he put me up at where I stayed at night. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2850.56s)]
*  It was just, it was unbelievable. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2853.88s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2857.04s)]
*  That was a great, he's a great human. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2857.88s)]
*  Yeah, definitely a great human. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2859.4s)]
*  I mean, even on my show, he came and we did a giveaway show [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2861.04s)]
*  where Tyler Perry came in and he just gave stuff away. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2864.6400000000003s)]
*  He paid the mortgage off for one of our guests. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2868.96s)]
*  He gave a colleague of mine who's a comic [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2872.6s)]
*  who had a stroke, Bone Hampton. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2875.52s)]
*  He was a Christian comic. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2877.1600000000003s)]
*  Now he's in a wheelchair. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2878.6400000000003s)]
*  He gave him $100,000 so he could figure out. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2880.0s)]
*  So he had a cushion to figure out what he wanted to do. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2882.68s)]
*  I mean, he gave, he just gave away. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2885.56s)]
*  It was really wonderful what he did. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2888.48s)]
*  He did that publicly, the $100,000? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2889.96s)]
*  Yes, we did it on my show. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2891.7999999999997s)]
*  Why, you think that you need a $100,000 show on that? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2893.68s)]
*  No, I just wouldn't want nobody to know that [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2895.7999999999997s)]
*  because then everybody be asking you for $100,000. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2897.48s)]
*  They really do. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2899.16s)]
*  They really do, yeah. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2900.0s)]
*  That's the downside. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2901.52s)]
*  But the beauty about Tyler, he had no problem saying no. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2902.8399999999997s)]
*  He says no. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2905.3199999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2906.16s)]
*  Because when I had to pitch it to him, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2906.98s)]
*  I would say to him, we had this, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2908.24s)]
*  he go, tell me what you're talking about. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2909.48s)]
*  No, like when you come to Tyler, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2911.6s)]
*  it has to be very specific, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2913.88s)]
*  it has to be very well thought out, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2915.44s)]
*  and you have to have research. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2916.8399999999997s)]
*  Because he says, okay, so if I do this, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2918.3199999999997s)]
*  then what about this? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2920.56s)]
*  How are they gonna pay this? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2921.48s)]
*  And I said, I don't know. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2922.48s)]
*  I'm just coming to you asking for the money. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2923.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2925.08s)]
*  He goes, well, when you know it, then you call me back. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2925.92s)]
*  So you have to be on your business. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2928.64s)]
*  Can you speak about that real quick, Sherry? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2930.7999999999997s)]
*  How important is it to actually say what it is you mean? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2932.04s)]
*  Because we live in a generation where these kids be like, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2936.4s)]
*  well, you know what I meant to say. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2938.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2939.68s)]
*  Well, you know what I meant to say. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2940.68s)]
*  I think that we're in an age of communication is harder [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2941.92s)]
*  because we're in the social media age [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2945.48s)]
*  where you swipe and swipe. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2946.84s)]
*  And so you putting in initials for laugh out loud, LOL. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2947.96s)]
*  So you're not saying what you mean. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2952.12s)]
*  And I think it's a big problem. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2954.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know how to fix it [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2956.84s)]
*  because I keep trying to talk to my nieces and nephews [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2958.6s)]
*  and say, tell me what you're saying. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2960.68s)]
*  Don't think I know what you're saying. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2962.68s)]
*  I don't know if it's a life lesson [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2964.36s)]
*  that they have to go through [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2965.7599999999998s)]
*  because I had to go through to get it. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2967.32s)]
*  Whoopi was very hard on me on the view. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2969.2s)]
*  Tell me what you're saying. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2971.04s)]
*  And I had to figure out and articulate. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2972.72s)]
*  So that came, that was hard for me. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2974.8399999999997s)]
*  What was that like having Whoopi be like, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2977.24s)]
*  yo, tell me what you're saying. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2979.08s)]
*  Oh, she was hard on me. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2980.56s)]
*  Whoopi was very, very hard, but she loved me. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2981.48s)]
*  And she didn't want to see me go through a lot of stuff, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2984.2799999999997s)]
*  which has served me well having my own show [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2986.64s)]
*  and dealing with criticism, being able to say no. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2989.56s)]
*  I say what I mean on my show, but I'm grown. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2992.2s)]
*  I think that's why I got the success at this age. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2995.52s)]
*  Because I know how to stand up for myself. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=2999.96s)]
*  I know how to say no. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3001.4s)]
*  I know how to say yes. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3002.52s)]
*  I know what I am bringing to the show [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3003.6s)]
*  and what I want to see. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3006.24s)]
*  So sometimes you just have to go through life. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3007.72s)]
*  You gotta fall and you gotta learn to get back up. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3010.68s)]
*  You gotta fall, you gotta learn to get back up. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3013.4s)]
*  And I'm sure Whoopi saw the greatness in you. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3015.4s)]
*  Like a lot of times people see things in you [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3017.0s)]
*  that you may not see in yourself. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3018.24s)]
*  Sometimes, yeah, maybe she did. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3020.08s)]
*  I would hope that, yeah. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3022.4s)]
*  We look at you now. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3023.96s)]
*  Yeah, I know, we came a long way. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3025.48s)]
*  We came a long way from when you called me [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3027.64s)]
*  the Tasmanian devil, Mr. Charlamagne the God. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3028.96s)]
*  That's when we first met. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3031.92s)]
*  Y'all remember that? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3032.7599999999998s)]
*  Mr. Mim's house? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3033.6s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3034.44s)]
*  And I don't know if you heard earlier [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3035.2799999999997s)]
*  when you started talking about yourself. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3036.12s)]
*  He was like, damn, as soon as you said it, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3036.96s)]
*  I don't know if you heard it. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3037.7999999999997s)]
*  But he still took a little shot at you earlier today. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3039.2799999999997s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3041.16s)]
*  What did you say? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3042.0s)]
*  Exactly, what is he talking about? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3042.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know, but I'm with Envy. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3044.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3045.6s)]
*  So we're still kicking it with Sherri Shepherd. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3046.44s)]
*  Charlamagne? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3048.0s)]
*  Did Nia Long ever take you up on your conversation [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3048.8399999999997s)]
*  to come on your show? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3051.8799999999997s)]
*  I guess that's who you was alluding to. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3053.3199999999997s)]
*  They said that's who you were alluding to [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3054.88s)]
*  when they said she rolled up on you at the Othello. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3056.52s)]
*  Oh, when I said unnamed celebrity. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3058.0s)]
*  We exclusively reported that a source had told me [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3059.4s)]
*  that it was Nia Long. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3061.76s)]
*  Yes, did Nia Long take me up? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3062.6000000000004s)]
*  Because I didn't say her name, but yes, it was Nia Long. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3064.32s)]
*  Here's the thing, I don't know who Nia Long [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3068.88s)]
*  had me confused with, and what I appreciate, Lauren, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3072.52s)]
*  this is why I love you, you did your research, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3075.76s)]
*  you did your homework, and you pulled up a clip. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3077.36s)]
*  The only time I've ever talked about Nia Long [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3079.6400000000003s)]
*  is when she went through it with her partner, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3081.92s)]
*  it was infidelity, and I supported her [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3085.4s)]
*  in that she deserves to have a good man to be with her, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3087.64s)]
*  and you pulled up that clip. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3090.84s)]
*  So thank you for that, you handled that very well. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3092.56s)]
*  So I have no idea, I think Nia Long maybe confused me [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3095.2s)]
*  with someone. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3098.72s)]
*  There's not a lot of black women on TV. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3099.56s)]
*  I have no idea who she thought was shading her, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3101.16s)]
*  but it was not me, I have no beef with Nia Long, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3104.72s)]
*  I'm a fan of hers, we're grown women, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3107.32s)]
*  we're both the same age, so we can discuss it. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3109.2799999999997s)]
*  That's why I invited her on my show. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3112.24s)]
*  And a lot of people say, well, why would you say [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3115.08s)]
*  something like that publicly? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3116.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, number one, I never said her name, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3117.64s)]
*  there was a lot of women that attended the Othello premiere. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3119.68s)]
*  And number two, I'm a stand-up comic, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3123.3199999999997s)]
*  so everything that happens in my life is material for me, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3126.0s)]
*  and my stage, my comedy stage, is the talk show. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3129.3199999999997s)]
*  So I got on stage and I just talked about it, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3132.8799999999997s)]
*  and I said, you know, this happened. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3135.2799999999997s)]
*  You wanted to know why I went to the bathroom, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3138.3599999999997s)]
*  because I said I went to the bathroom [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3140.2799999999997s)]
*  and I had a meeting in the ladies' room. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3141.56s)]
*  That was actually a joke, because climax, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3143.24s)]
*  this is why I don't get with younger men. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3146.44s)]
*  It was climax, meeting in the ladies' room, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3148.56s)]
*  I'll be back, and she says, don't test me, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3152.2s)]
*  because I might slap you, remember? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3156.52s)]
*  You a DJ, God don't. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3159.0s)]
*  And me, if anybody, and so I said the joke, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3161.04s)]
*  Norman Baker, who's the head of Hot Topics, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3165.24s)]
*  he was like, that's funny, everybody got it, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3167.7599999999998s)]
*  and you over here go, I don't understand [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3169.88s)]
*  how she went to the, was waiting in the bathroom. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3171.2799999999997s)]
*  You and Jess, so that's what that was, that was a joke. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3174.7599999999998s)]
*  But yeah, but I don't have any beef. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3177.16s)]
*  I don't like to tear down people, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3179.48s)]
*  but I honestly was just confused, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3181.7999999999997s)]
*  and I also don't like when you touch me and you pull at me. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3185.24s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3189.2s)]
*  You said she grabbed you. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3190.2s)]
*  Like, grabbed me and spun me around, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3191.48s)]
*  and here's the thing, I'm a really nice person. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3193.04s)]
*  That's your real way to have me in the end, too. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3196.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, like, you don't like when people do this. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3197.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh, that's what you meant, huh? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3201.2799999999997s)]
*  No. Oh my God. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3202.4399999999996s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3203.8399999999997s)]
*  I hate him, go ahead, I'm sorry. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3205.2s)]
*  You know, you said, Charlemagne. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3206.48s)]
*  He never turns it off, by the way. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3209.04s)]
*  Never. I don't know how. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3210.52s)]
*  No, but now I can't unsee it. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3211.64s)]
*  This is why I tell women, stop getting with stand-up comics, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3213.3999999999996s)]
*  because you gotta sit in bed, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3215.8399999999997s)]
*  and they go over the same joke and punchline over and over, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3217.8399999999997s)]
*  and you gotta hear that all night long. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3221.2799999999997s)]
*  Charlemagne, your wife, God bless her, Lord, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3223.7599999999998s)]
*  open up doors for her, bless her, just bless her, Father God. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3226.6s)]
*  It could be your darkest moment, you could be crying. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3231.04s)]
*  He's not gonna be sympathetic. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3233.48s)]
*  No, I am sympathetic, I just wanted to bring some joy. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3234.56s)]
*  That's a lie! [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3237.24s)]
*  No, but it's like, when people tug at you, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3238.84s)]
*  when they wanna pick you, when they tug at you, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3241.32s)]
*  it's like, so, I'm still, I think people, I'm so nice, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3243.0s)]
*  but you can't confuse that, I'm a Chicago girl. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3246.24s)]
*  So when that happens, you know, then I go there. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3249.12s)]
*  But you know, I'm cool, I'm so cool, it's done. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3252.28s)]
*  If Nealon would love to come on my show, I would love, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3255.48s)]
*  I'm a fan, we're both actresses, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3257.96s)]
*  I would love to talk to her and just clear it up. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3260.64s)]
*  That's such a, that's why these beefs that come on social media, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3263.36s)]
*  like, it's easily cleared up. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3266.6s)]
*  So I would love to talk to her. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3268.96s)]
*  And it's young girl behavior, like, I wonder, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3269.7999999999997s)]
*  cause she's been around for so long, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3271.88s)]
*  what could she think you said that would cause her to [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3274.2s)]
*  grab you at a Apollo premiere? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3276.92s)]
*  I don't think it's young girl behavior, Charlemagne. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3277.7599999999998s)]
*  Sometimes you don't see a person, you know, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3279.52s)]
*  sometimes these things fester. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3282.48s)]
*  This is what Whoopi told me, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3284.04s)]
*  and this is why I'm very nice on my talk show. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3285.16s)]
*  She said, we were about to do a story, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3287.72s)]
*  I wanted to do a story on The View about a certain rapper, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3290.24s)]
*  the baby mama was asking for more money, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3293.7999999999997s)]
*  then something happened bad, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3296.56s)]
*  and I wanted to blame it on this rapper. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3298.36s)]
*  And I said, I wanna talk about this. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3300.72s)]
*  And Whoopi said, we not gonna talk about it. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3303.08s)]
*  And I said, no, no, no, we got this platform, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3304.92s)]
*  and I'ma let people know. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3307.96s)]
*  And she said, no. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3309.12s)]
*  So Barbara Walters said, if Whoopi's not going to talk about it, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3309.96s)]
*  we're not going to talk about it. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3313.36s)]
*  And I went into Whoopi's room and I said, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3315.12s)]
*  why would you kill this story? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3317.04s)]
*  It's very interesting, everybody knows the rapper. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3319.44s)]
*  And she said, let me tell you something, Sherri. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3322.2000000000003s)]
*  She said, celebrities have long memories. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3323.52s)]
*  You know this, y'all know this. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3326.68s)]
*  They have long memories. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3328.64s)]
*  You have a career beyond this show. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3329.76s)]
*  And she said, and what will happen is [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3331.7200000000003s)]
*  you might go to a club and encounter this rapper. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3333.52s)]
*  You are black women, we'd at least protect it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3337.12s)]
*  And if they get mad at you and wanna do something, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3339.64s)]
*  ain't nobody gonna do nothing. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3341.52s)]
*  Now, Elizabeth Hasselbeck goes to the club, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3342.6s)]
*  cause she didn't say something, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3344.28s)]
*  and he doesn't, he say, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3345.64s)]
*  everybody gonna be calling the police. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3347.08s)]
*  Ain't even gonna do nothing to. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3348.44s)]
*  Won't even do nothing to. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3349.76s)]
*  She said, you always had to keep that in mind. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3351.08s)]
*  And she said, and you want to work beyond this show. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3353.12s)]
*  Cause you're not gonna be here for long. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3356.2400000000002s)]
*  You're gonna be working. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3357.48s)]
*  And celebrities have very long memories [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3358.48s)]
*  and you're in the business and your career is important. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3360.84s)]
*  And I just always remember that. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3364.1600000000003s)]
*  And I'm a kind person. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3365.84s)]
*  So when I come at stories, Lauren, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3367.1600000000003s)]
*  I always go, is it edifying? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3369.48s)]
*  I would rather you be laughing with me going, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3370.92s)]
*  that girl is talking about me today. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3373.52s)]
*  That is so funny what she says. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3375.6800000000003s)]
*  They never have to do. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3377.0s)]
*  I'm too old to be in a club. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3378.4s)]
*  And somebody comes up to me and goes, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3380.1600000000003s)]
*  my name is Thon Thon. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3381.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't like, you know, I heard what you said. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3383.04s)]
*  And I ain't gonna be, I'm not gonna be him in there. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3385.76s)]
*  And you bet not. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3388.28s)]
*  First of all, I'm 50. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3389.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't even know who you are. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3390.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't remember what I said. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3391.84s)]
*  Wait, did she just slap me? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3393.8s)]
*  Like, I don't be fighting no more like that. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3395.1200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, it's like life is too short. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3397.48s)]
*  I want to put out good energy on my show. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3400.4s)]
*  I want you to feel good. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3403.52s)]
*  I want you to know that when you come to the show [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3404.84s)]
*  it's a safe space. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3407.32s)]
*  If you don't want to talk about something, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3408.52s)]
*  there's a ton of other stuff we can talk about. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3410.4s)]
*  If you want the shady stuff, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3413.0800000000004s)]
*  it's a bunch of blogs you can go to. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3414.4s)]
*  And I think that people, even though they like that, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3416.7200000000003s)]
*  they turn on you quick. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3419.52s)]
*  They turn on you quick when you're always giving out [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3421.1200000000003s)]
*  bad stuff and talking about people. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3423.6000000000004s)]
*  I think I have more fans that will stick with me [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3426.1600000000003s)]
*  if I go through something than not. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3428.7200000000003s)]
*  So that's just the way I operate and it has worked. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3431.1600000000003s)]
*  I feel like God is talking through you. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3433.92s)]
*  Did you just say that three minutes ago? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3437.16s)]
*  No, he's just always talking to me. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3438.64s)]
*  Oh, and I did. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3440.68s)]
*  Yes, we've had a lot of conversations this week. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3441.64s)]
*  And yesterday, everything you just said [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3443.88s)]
*  has been in the convos all week. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3446.3599999999997s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3447.44s)]
*  And yesterday, I literally was recording my podcast, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3447.88s)]
*  The Latest with Lauren LaRosa, before you came in here. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3451.16s)]
*  And on my podcast, I was talking about how I talked to God [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3453.52s)]
*  yesterday and was like, look, I hear you. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3456.72s)]
*  I get it. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3458.2799999999997s)]
*  I know what I need to do to dial back and, you know, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3459.04s)]
*  focus and whatever, whatever. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3461.04s)]
*  And then you come in here and you're literally, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3462.08s)]
*  it sounds better coming from you, though. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3463.96s)]
*  You look a lot better. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3465.8s)]
*  You have been here preaching. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3467.36s)]
*  I mean, you do not know how God has been talking through you [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3468.52s)]
*  this morning. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3470.84s)]
*  But that went over there. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3471.92s)]
*  Now, there is a generation of women watching your show [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3473.0800000000004s)]
*  who feel seen and heard. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3475.8s)]
*  So what do you want the Sherri show to represent [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3477.52s)]
*  in this messy, meme-driven media landscape? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3479.6400000000003s)]
*  I want the young brown girls to look at me and say, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3482.76s)]
*  it's possible. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3487.28s)]
*  I can do that. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3488.52s)]
*  You know, that's why representation matters. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3489.88s)]
*  People keep saying, no, no, we all one. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3492.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3495.12s)]
*  I saw Oprah Winfrey doing it and she looked like me. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3496.2s)]
*  We had the same kind of hair, sans the wig. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3499.3999999999996s)]
*  We had the same kind of hair, her skin color. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3502.3599999999997s)]
*  It matters. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3505.3199999999997s)]
*  And so when little girls look at me and they come and see me [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3506.24s)]
*  and they call me Auntie, I'm like, yes, you can do this. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3509.52s)]
*  There's a space for you. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3513.04s)]
*  I want you to feel like there is a space. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3514.2s)]
*  I want you to come up to me and ask me for advice. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3517.04s)]
*  I want you to get ready because it's there for the taking. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3520.64s)]
*  So I think a lot of social media people, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3524.44s)]
*  it comes at them so fast. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3526.56s)]
*  And when the crash comes, they're not able to rebound. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3528.8s)]
*  You know, so put in the work and it'll happen. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3531.92s)]
*  Sherri Sheffley. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3537.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3538.12s)]
*  Make sure you check her out on Strawh today. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3539.28s)]

*  It's the Breakfast Club Good Morning. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3542.28s)]

*  Lauren be coming with straight facts. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3545.64s)]
*  Tell her. Tell her. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3547.36s)]
*  Man. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3548.2000000000003s)]
*  She gets them from somebody that knows somebody. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3549.04s)]
*  She gets the details. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3550.88s)]
*  I'm the home girl that knows a little bit about everything [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3552.08s)]
*  to be having the latest on the latest with Lauren La Rosa. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3555.1600000000003s)]
*  Sometimes you have facts. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3560.1600000000003s)]
*  Sometimes you have details. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3561.0s)]
*  Sometimes you have a little bit of everything. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3562.0400000000004s)]
*  But what's the latest on the Breakfast Club? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3563.48s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3565.5600000000004s)]
*  Alrighty guys. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3567.96s)]
*  So a bit more from the BET media room that we did. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3568.8s)]
*  I sat down and I talked to Tamar Braxton. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3573.8s)]
*  She made some comments about Lonnie Love. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3575.6000000000004s)]
*  Let's take a listen to her comments first on a Nini Leakes show. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3578.32s)]
*  I was asked to be on the rail [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3581.6400000000003s)]
*  and this was in the beginning of the process of them casting. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3584.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm sure it was Tamar and the other girls [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3588.5200000000004s)]
*  but I was asked to be one of the first girls [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3590.92s)]
*  when the show first originally started. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3592.88s)]
*  I had the contract and I ended up not doing the real [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3594.7200000000003s)]
*  and they ended up casting Lonnie Love. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3597.44s)]
*  I was on Real Housewives of Atlanta. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3599.4s)]
*  So I just did not do the real. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3601.5600000000004s)]
*  But Tamar ultimately did the real. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3604.44s)]
*  I wish they would have told me. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3606.76s)]
*  Really? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3608.32s)]

*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3611.6800000000003s)]
*  I wish they would have told me that [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3612.5200000000004s)]
*  I wouldn't have cast Big Bad Cadillac. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3613.76s)]
*  I'm fitting your red legs. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3615.84s)]

*  Hey yo. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3624.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, I talked to her about that in the media room. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3625.36s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Tamar [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3627.8s)]
*  on her Big Bad Cadillac comments. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3629.0s)]
*  When I said, will there ever be any reconciliation? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3631.44s)]
*  You said you won't say that. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3633.84s)]
*  I won't say that. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3635.56s)]
*  So you're open to a conversation with Lonnie Love. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3636.4s)]
*  I am. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3638.08s)]
*  I'm open to a conversation because I feel like now [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3638.96s)]
*  first of all, I probably should say this out loud [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3643.7200000000003s)]
*  and in front of everybody. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3646.1600000000003s)]
*  I apologize for calling her a Big Bad Cadillac. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3647.92s)]
*  Not in any way did I wanna shame her or, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3651.7200000000003s)]
*  I've held on to my composure all of this time [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3655.76s)]
*  and never said nothing bad. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3660.6s)]
*  And that was just really a vulnerable moment. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3663.36s)]
*  And I apologize Lonnie. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3666.32s)]
*  I really want to have a conversation [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3668.04s)]
*  that could lead to a reconcile. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3671.2400000000002s)]
*  You're supposed to ask her, Lauren, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3674.2000000000003s)]
*  what size Cadillac were you talking about? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3676.2000000000003s)]
*  Did you mean an XT4 or XT5 or XT6 or an Escalade? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3678.1200000000003s)]
*  Or was it an Escalade ESV? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3681.92s)]
*  No. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3683.32s)]
*  What size Cadillac? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3684.1600000000003s)]
*  That's the Big Bad Cadillac. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3685.0s)]
*  That's the Big Bad Cadillac. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3686.0s)]
*  The ESV? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3686.84s)]
*  The ESV, oh my goodness. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3687.6800000000003s)]
*  You should have asked her what size Cadillac. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3689.08s)]
*  I can't even get to the one question, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3691.08s)]
*  like that question I asked her. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3692.84s)]
*  She said Big Bad Cadillac. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3693.88s)]
*  I literally was, I was trying not to laugh [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3695.08s)]
*  because it was just so funny. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3697.6s)]
*  But look at the growth though. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3699.0s)]
*  She apologized. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3700.1200000000003s)]
*  She did. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3701.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3702.2400000000002s)]
*  Did you hear people from yelling Big Bad Cadillac [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3703.92s)]
*  when they see Lonnie in the street? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3705.16s)]
*  I understand. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3706.64s)]
*  Now you got people calling every Big Bad person Big Back. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3707.48s)]
*  That was not me. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3711.24s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3712.56s)]
*  What's funny is imagine a Cadillac Escalade [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3713.4s)]
*  pull up beside Lonnie and beep the horn. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3715.68s)]
*  See, that's messed up. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3718.04s)]
*  But she did apologize, so that's messed up. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3720.7999999999997s)]
*  She did. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3723.12s)]
*  She didn't be calling nobody no ride shell. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3723.96s)]
*  That's what she did, she called her a ride shell. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3725.2s)]
*  Wow. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3728.16s)]
*  Honda, I just... [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3729.0s)]
*  Let's stay focused. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3730.04s)]
*  Now, well, I do want to say too, Tamar mentioned, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3731.7200000000003s)]
*  she wanted us to mention this. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3734.6s)]
*  She has her new show on MTV called [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3735.6s)]
*  Calling the Active Double Life [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3737.32s)]

*  Something like that? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3748.48s)]
*  I think it's like a spinoff of it though, right? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3749.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3751.08s)]

*  And Wendy Williams had watched it [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3755.52s)]
*  and thought Envy was on the show and he was gay. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3757.0s)]
*  He thought Envy had snuck up on his boyfriend. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3760.8s)]
*  I promise you she thought that. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3762.52s)]

*  She thought she was gay. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3769.2400000000002s)]
*  She thought she was creeping up on your boyfriend. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3770.08s)]
*  Because you was helping Big Sexy get up off the floor. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3771.08s)]
*  I was helping Big Sexy out. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3773.08s)]

*  The dye was running. Absolutely. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3779.1200000000003s)]
*  And I was trying to help the big brother out. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3780.36s)]
*  Like you said, I saw Envy on TV with the big gay guy [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3782.1200000000003s)]
*  and he goes, why would you do that to me? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3785.2400000000002s)]
*  Why would I? Why would he do that to me? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3787.24s)]

*  Are you friends still or? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3830.2000000000003s)]
*  We're not friends, but I mean like that bond that we had [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3831.7200000000003s)]

*  but it happens, it happens. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3868.1600000000003s)]
*  I thought that was very unfortunate to hear [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3871.12s)]
*  that they're not actually friends anymore. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3872.76s)]
*  They only played what? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3874.4s)]
*  One year with each other though, right? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3875.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but I just think they went through. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3876.76s)]
*  But we stayed together a lot too. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3878.96s)]
*  One or two, I think it was two years. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3880.6s)]
*  Two years. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3881.8s)]
*  Yeah, but we did see them and they were like, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3882.6400000000003s)]
*  they had each other's backs and you know what I mean? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3883.6400000000003s)]
*  Like they were, they seem like pretty close to me. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3885.48s)]
*  She been saying they weren't friends though. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3887.6800000000003s)]
*  It's not a beef, it's just that we just not. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3889.52s)]
*  They ain't close no more. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3890.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I know also too there was that [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3892.88s)]
*  the incident with the parents going back [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3895.04s)]
*  and forth on social media as well, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3897.2000000000003s)]
*  but they got through that. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3898.96s)]
*  But I just feel like they went through so much together [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3899.8s)]
*  because you know, the noise was so loud around them [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3901.56s)]
*  and they were doing it together. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3904.2s)]
*  So I think I would have loved to hear her say like, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3905.8399999999997s)]
*  they're not maybe as close, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3908.2s)]
*  but they still speak or they whatever. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3909.6s)]
*  We not friends sounds like, I'm good. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3910.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they do different jobs. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3913.52s)]
*  One's in the WNBA, one's still in college. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3914.6s)]
*  They got different lives. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3916.64s)]
*  They're not together all the time anymore. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3918.08s)]
*  You can be on the same team and not be friends. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3919.08s)]
*  Like you go on this, you go out there, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3920.68s)]
*  you play on the court, you win games [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3922.52s)]
*  and you go home and live your life. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3924.24s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so, yeah, 100%. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3926.4399999999996s)]
*  Cause both of them are saying we still support each other. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3928.3999999999996s)]
*  So to your point, y'all are right. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=3929.8799999999997s)]

*  Ray J, you should be way past the do anything for clout era. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4131.72s)]
*  I remember Ray J calling me one time [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4135.12s)]
*  and expressing how he has the desire [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4137.18s)]
*  to be seen as a businessman. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4139.56s)]
*  He said that we should be focusing more [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4141.0s)]
*  on what he's doing in the tech world. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4142.8s)]
*  And I agree. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4144.320000000001s)]
*  Okay, Ray J has had some success with those scooty bikes. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4145.320000000001s)]
*  When Ray J was with Raycon, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4148.72s)]
*  they had a valuation of like 85 to a hundred million dollars. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4150.12s)]
*  That's no small feat. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4153.2s)]
*  That's big business. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4154.320000000001s)]
*  Okay, it's an amazing thing to see a black man [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4155.400000000001s)]
*  be a part of something like that. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4157.8s)]
*  Then he sold his stake in Raycon [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4159.12s)]
*  and opened up the Tronics network. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4160.72s)]
*  He allegedly put like $5 million of his own money [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4162.12s)]
*  into the Tronics network. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4166.08s)]
*  That too is big business, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4167.320000000001s)]
*  but I don't even hear him talk [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4169.56s)]
*  about the Tronics network anymore. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4170.84s)]
*  Okay, my point is Ray J has done incredible things [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4172.2s)]
*  in the world of business, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4174.6s)]
*  but his antics like this always overshadow it. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4175.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, Willie Ray Norwood Jr. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4178.76s)]
*  You will never get your just do [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4180.6s)]
*  for what you've done in the business world. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4182.04s)]
*  If you're online, still moving and talking [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4183.7s)]
*  like we were in our twenties. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4186.3s)]
*  Now, what did sexy red have to say about this? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4187.52s)]
*  Well, she took to Instagram to say, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4190.38s)]
*  calm ball ass lying on your meat is weird. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4192.18s)]
*  Playing your ass, not with me. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4195.14s)]
*  What? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4197.1s)]
*  Ah! [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4197.9400000000005s)]
*  What? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4198.78s)]
*  Then she said, even to be saying [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4199.7s)]
*  we slept on the plane together. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4201.82s)]
*  I said hi and kept it pushing is you cuckoo. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4203.58s)]
*  And she reposted a screenshot [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4206.54s)]
*  of her sending Ray J the video saying, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4208.1s)]
*  so this what you doing? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4209.9400000000005s)]
*  Playing with people name on the internet. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4210.86s)]
*  Ray J replied, I said, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4212.5s)]
*  right after we slept on the plane together, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4214.42s)]
*  you know I'm playing. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4217.06s)]
*  I'm always trolling and you know I love you. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4218.06s)]
*  I'll make it clear right now on my main page. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4221.14s)]
*  Sorry if you mad at me, I'll make it right now. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4222.58s)]
*  The problem with the apology though, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4225.14s)]
*  is the apology is never as loud as the offense. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4227.58s)]
*  The truth is never as loud as the lie. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4230.9800000000005s)]
*  The lie that Ray J slept with sexy red [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4233.74s)]
*  went around the world twice. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4236.46s)]
*  Why the truth is still putting on his shoes. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4238.4800000000005s)]
*  Ray J did do a more formal apology. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4241.18s)]
*  Let's listen. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4243.22s)]
*  I wanna apologize to sexy red [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4244.42s)]
*  because sexy red is one of my favorite artists. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4246.74s)]
*  Sexy red and I was on a plane [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4251.06s)]
*  and we were both flying somewhere, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4253.5s)]
*  randomly saw each other. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4256.26s)]
*  She was sitting by me. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4258.06s)]
*  She had her space, I had my space. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4259.860000000001s)]
*  She had her own blanket, her own pillow. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4262.740000000001s)]
*  I had my own blanket and my own pillow. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4265.02s)]
*  And we had a long flight and we both were tired. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4267.54s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4271.5s)]
*  So we just, we went to sleep. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4272.34s)]
*  Just like we would sleep with anybody else [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4273.5s)]
*  that was sitting next to us on the plane. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4276.02s)]
*  I went out of control and I said that I slept with sexy red [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4277.98s)]
*  and that's just as insensitive and it's not okay. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4282.459999999999s)]
*  And it's trolling at the highest level. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4286.139999999999s)]
*  And I wanna say sexy red, my bad. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4288.419999999999s)]
*  Here's the teachable moment. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4293.0599999999995s)]
*  June is men's mental health month. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4294.379999999999s)]
*  If you feel the need to get online [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4296.379999999999s)]
*  and be a chronic and compulsive liar at the age of 44, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4298.379999999999s)]
*  lies that are manipulative and damaging [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4302.179999999999s)]
*  that could hurt relationships with people, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4304.419999999999s)]
*  could hurt careers, even yourself, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4306.32s)]
*  then you might be dealing with an underlying condition [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4308.28s)]
*  that you need to sit [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4310.719999999999s)]
*  with a mental health professional about. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4311.679999999999s)]
*  I'm serious, my brothers, we gotta do better. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4313.679999999999s)]
*  Ray J is 44, sexy red is 27. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4315.84s)]
*  At this point Ray, you should be teaching [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4319.38s)]
*  the next generation how to move. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4321.96s)]
*  They should be looking to you to know how to move, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4323.48s)]
*  but instead you got them looking at you like you washed. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4325.679999999999s)]
*  You moving like you on the corner [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4329.12s)]
*  with a Starbucks cup in your hand, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4330.48s)]
*  dancing the wait a minute, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4332.12s)]
*  hoping somebody gives you a couple of dollars. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4333.36s)]
*  And you can't tell me you just doing this [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4335.6s)]
*  to build up your chat, okay? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4337.56s)]
*  You can't just tell me that, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4339.64s)]
*  because in the screaming world, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4340.96s)]
*  I don't even see the screamers moving like this, okay? [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4342.320000000001s)]
*  Not the ones I watch. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4344.360000000001s)]
*  The ones I watch got very high emotional IQs. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4345.360000000001s)]
*  Kyle Sinatra, of course, and Little Reggie, Duke Dennis. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4348.0s)]
*  I don't see them resorting to lying on their beef whistles, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4351.120000000001s)]
*  saying they slept with certain celebrities [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4354.02s)]
*  to garner attention for their chats. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4355.8s)]
*  Ray J, you got a daughter, you got a niece. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4358.080000000001s)]
*  Would you want somebody playing with their name like that? [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4360.8s)]
*  Would you want somebody playing [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4363.080000000001s)]
*  with your sister's name like that, huh? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4364.12s)]
*  The answer to those questions are no, okay? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4367.2s)]
*  Ray, I know you wanna be down with this new screaming world. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4369.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, you be sitting up in your room [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4373.48s)]
*  in front of that laptop, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4375.28s)]
*  trying to keep up with them youngsters. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4376.64s)]
*  But if I had one wish, Ray, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4378.32s)]
*  that wish would be for you to grow up, okay? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4380.32s)]
*  I'm not saying anything right now I haven't told you before. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4382.88s)]
*  Grow up. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4385.76s)]
*  At 44, there is a level of emotional maturity [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4386.599999999999s)]
*  you're supposed to have, okay? [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4389.96s)]
*  You need to sit with a therapist [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4391.16s)]
*  or some mental health professional [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4392.5599999999995s)]
*  and ask, what is this attention seeking behavior [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4394.88s)]
*  you constantly display? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4397.16s)]
*  Is it learned from childhood? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4398.76s)]
*  You didn't grow up in a toxic environment [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4400.32s)]
*  as far as I know, what is it, okay? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4401.8s)]
*  Look, I'm no mental health expert. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4404.2s)]
*  I've never claimed to be. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4405.68s)]
*  I'm just a man who's had some experiences [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4406.52s)]
*  and I'm a man who had to confront [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4408.92s)]
*  my own emotional immaturity. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4410.48s)]
*  And it comes to a point in our lives [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4412.64s)]
*  when we have to look in the mirror [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4414.0s)]
*  and stop avoiding accountability [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4415.12s)]
*  or uncomfortable truths about ourselves. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4417.16s)]
*  And the truth is, if a man is 44 years old [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4420.12s)]
*  still lying for attention, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4424.24s)]
*  it might not always be a clinical diagnosis, [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4425.96s)]
*  but it's almost always a sign [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4428.9s)]
*  that he hasn't healed something. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4431.04s)]
*  Was it his fear, insecurity or trauma? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4434.0s)]
*  Something deeper is driving the behavior [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4437.04s)]
*  and Willie Ray Norwood Jr. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4439.72s)]
*  I sincerely hope you heal. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4441.72s)]
*  Please let Remy Ma give Ray J the biggest he-ha. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4444.72s)]

*  And we used to perform at the Brooklyn Moon downstairs. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4661.5199999999995s)]
*  We would rehearse and then we'd come up through skits. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4664.84s)]
*  I was the theater professor, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4667.2s)]

*  They was the hot mess. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4671.36s)]
*  But anyway, stars used to come through [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4673.04s)]
*  and sometimes we'd bring the hat up, they'd put money in. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4675.759999999999s)]
*  This guy had notoriety a little bit, who was a comedian. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4679.48s)]
*  He's still a comedian, I guess. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4683.759999999999s)]
*  But he was kind of effeminate, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4685.44s)]
*  so I didn't think that, you know, anything. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4687.839999999999s)]
*  But anyway, I gave him a chance. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4691.0s)]
*  He called me or whatever, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4693.959999999999s)]
*  thinking it was just gonna be a normal night. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4695.44s)]
*  And he went back and told Darnell. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4697.759999999999s)]
*  And so Darnell was like, oh, so you slept. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4700.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was like, but he didn't tell Darnell [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4703.48s)]
*  that he couldn't get an erection. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4705.839999999999s)]

*  because I'm in the theater world. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4747.28s)]
*  So sometimes we deal with a lot of gay people, whatever. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4748.4s)]
*  And you could pick it up and that's no big deal. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=4752.08s)]

*  That is an interesting story. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5064.68s)]
*  That is interesting, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5066.0s)]
*  cause I wonder what the hell happened. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5066.84s)]
*  Yeah, why would he lie if he could really hit? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5067.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5069.68s)]
*  Exactly and then a few years later, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5070.52s)]
*  it was like he came to me and my DMs on some creeping stuff [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5072.4800000000005s)]

*  All right, girl. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5082.64s)]
*  Let me tell y'all the moral of the story. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5083.8s)]
*  And the moral of the story is just simply [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5085.76s)]
*  you young boys need to know the rules. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5087.64s)]
*  When you lie on your meat, your meat gets smaller. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5089.64s)]
*  Okay, this is a scientific South Carolina fact. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5092.36s)]
*  Okay, when I was raised, that's what we were told. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5094.76s)]
*  If you lie about having sex with a woman, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5096.84s)]
*  your penis shrinks. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5098.8s)]
*  So do with that what you will. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5100.12s)]
*  All right. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5103.44s)]
*  Don't lie. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5104.28s)]
*  Cause when your ass get called out, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5105.48s)]
*  then what you gonna say? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5107.44s)]

*  on the Breakfast Club and curse out Charlamagne. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5279.64s)]
*  Come on! [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5281.8s)]
*  What did you say about Lil Twist? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5282.64s)]
*  I don't even remember, I'm sure I said, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5284.2s)]
*  I know I had some heat to it. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5285.64s)]
*  I don't remember, truck fit. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5287.4400000000005s)]
*  No, that wasn't Lil Twist. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5288.280000000001s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5289.120000000001s)]
*  I don't remember, I used to kill all of them [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5289.96s)]
*  with the truck fit thing. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5291.320000000001s)]
*  I used to ask all of them, what did you do for some truck fit? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5292.68s)]
*  That's Lil Wayne's fault, though. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5294.68s)]
*  Lil Wayne said, you did for some truck fit. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5296.04s)]
*  So if I see you walking around with a bunch of truck fit, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5299.160000000001s)]
*  do you know Lil Wayne is probably the only rapper [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5301.160000000001s)]
*  who killed his own clothing line with a line? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5302.92s)]
*  Nobody wanted to wear truck fit after Lil Wayne said that? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5305.68s)]
*  No, because you was the one that made fun of everybody [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5307.64s)]
*  for wearing truck fit. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5309.52s)]
*  Because Lil Wayne said that people suck for truck fit. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5310.360000000001s)]
*  Who followed that? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5314.6s)]
*  Anytime you see celebrities opening up truck fit online, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5317.04s)]
*  I'll be like, what'd you do to get it, though? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5320.44s)]
*  I remember Jay-O got so mad at me. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5322.44s)]
*  Damn, yo. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5324.44s)]
*  Sorry, what about that box, though? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5326.24s)]
*  With that outfit, it's crazy. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5327.24s)]
*  With that box, it was crazy because of the outfit. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5329.24s)]
*  He was a respectful young man. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5332.599999999999s)]
*  We seen him on the floor, he was a good guy, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5334.24s)]
*  but he said he wants to come up here and curse on me. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5335.88s)]
*  Listen, all of them are welcome to come, okay? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5337.04s)]
*  Charlamagne has never been one of those personalities [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5339.16s)]
*  who don't talk to people he talks about. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5341.36s)]
*  So they're all welcome. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5343.599999999999s)]
*  I love that. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5344.8s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5345.68s)]
*  Well, real quick, I just wanted to give an update [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5346.72s)]
*  because this happened towards the end of the week. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5348.92s)]
*  Diddy is asking for a mistrial right now. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5351.0s)]
*  He is basically alleging that the government [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5354.72s)]
*  is presenting false testimony, knowing that it's false. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5356.72s)]
*  Shoot, I would say everybody lying, too. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5359.160000000001s)]
*  Y'all and I did not rub no man's **** on my nipples. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5361.360000000001s)]
*  What? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5365.160000000001s)]
*  He wasn't talking about that. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5366.0s)]
*  No, no. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5366.84s)]
*  He didn't say that was a lie. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5367.68s)]
*  But let me tell you, because Jane Doe, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5369.0s)]
*  who was testifying on the stand, she had a story about, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5370.6s)]
*  she alleges that Diddy would make the sex workers [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5373.68s)]
*  finish on her, and she wasn't allowed to clean it up [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5375.8s)]
*  because Diddy allegedly wanted to play around with it, too. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5378.280000000001s)]
*  Another man's man milk? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5381.320000000001s)]
*  Yes! [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5383.320000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5384.160000000001s)]
*  Yes! [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5385.0s)]
*  First of all, in the producer world, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5385.84s)]
*  they call that a sample. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5387.200000000001s)]
*  All right, Diddy was sampling. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5388.360000000001s)]
*  What's wrong with you? [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5390.240000000001s)]
*  Yo. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5391.88s)]
*  That's horrible. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5392.72s)]
*  That's nasty. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5393.72s)]
*  It's not BJs. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5394.56s)]
*  Wait, well, then again, you know what? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5395.400000000001s)]
*  You know, BJs, they give you like a little. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5396.96s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't like all this macaroni ****. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5398.04s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5401.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5403.84s)]
*  Oh, macaroni **** is crazy. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5404.68s)]
*  What? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5406.64s)]
*  Yes! [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5407.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes! [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5408.320000000001s)]
*  Yes! [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5409.160000000001s)]
*  Yes! [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5410.0s)]
*  Yes! [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5410.84s)]
*  My God. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5411.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5412.52s)]
*  Can you imagine kids in the car right now? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5413.360000000001s)]
*  Mom, what's man milk? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5414.6s)]
*  What's that, mom? [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5416.160000000001s)]
*  You should not be listening to this, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5417.0s)]
*  especially during no Diddy trial. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5418.4400000000005s)]
*  I know. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5419.8s)]
*  Just turn the song. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5420.64s)]
*  The freak off menu. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5421.4800000000005s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5422.320000000001s)]
*  Yo, everybody in the media room is coming up to me [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5423.160000000001s)]
*  about Diddy, like everybody want to talk about Diddy. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5425.160000000001s)]
*  People are very invested in the man milk. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5428.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5430.120000000001s)]
*  Yes, but yeah, so he's asking for the Miss Charlie. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5431.160000000001s)]
*  He's basically trying to say that the woman Brianna, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5433.24s)]
*  who took the stand, that her testimony was false, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5434.96s)]
*  which prosecutors came in and debunked on the stand [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5437.84s)]
*  because she couldn't remember her dates, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5441.28s)]
*  but her photo said one date [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5443.32s)]
*  and then a text message from Cassie verified a different date. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5445.2s)]
*  So they cleared that up. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5448.24s)]
*  So, and wrapping up BET Awards tonight. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5449.36s)]
*  I'll be backstage at the BET Awards, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5451.639999999999s)]
*  8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 25 years of 106 and parks. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5453.76s)]
*  So there's going to be huge celebration. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5457.24s)]
*  Hey, why you keep shouting out the BET Awards, man? [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5458.08s)]
*  People know it's on tonight. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5459.88s)]
*  I'm glad you work in the backstage, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5460.96s)]
*  but we giving them way more than they gave us [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5462.44s)]
*  because I saw your broadcast space [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5464.36s)]
*  and I ain't seen no Breakfast Club signage. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5466.04s)]
*  I saw Nini Leakes had signage [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5467.679999999999s)]
*  and Angie Martinez had signage [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5469.24s)]
*  and damn near all the podcasts had signage. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5471.12s)]
*  Breakfast Club didn't have no signage. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5473.08s)]
*  It just said BET Awards signage everywhere. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5474.5599999999995s)]
*  So we giving them way more than they gave us. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5476.48s)]
*  She had a little something on her laptop. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5478.719999999999s)]
*  That was not even real. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5480.36s)]
*  That was photoshopped, super posed on or something. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5481.5599999999995s)]
*  That was AI? Yes. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5485.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little crazy. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5485.92s)]
*  I would advise you to look at our Instagram [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5487.04s)]
*  and then look at our YouTube and you compare the two. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5488.719999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5490.44s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is that [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5491.32s)]
*  the show is coming on tonight and I'm going to sleep. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5493.4s)]
*  Charlamagne, I don't know. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5496.04s)]
*  Y'all like them, not me. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5496.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5497.96s)]

*  There was a million plus people there. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5520.68s)]
*  We were on the float. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5522.4800000000005s)]
*  You're Dominican. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5523.4400000000005s)]
*  Huh? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5524.52s)]
*  You're Dominican. I'm black. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5525.360000000001s)]
*  They don't have a Dominican parade? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5526.280000000001s)]
*  They do. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCnydHboniQ&t=5527.400000000001s)]
