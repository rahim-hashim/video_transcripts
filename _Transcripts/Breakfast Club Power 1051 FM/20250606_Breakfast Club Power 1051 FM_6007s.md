*  I know, but he closed out. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=123.04s)]
*  But he had 14 last night. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=124.48s)]
*  But he closes out. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Salute to the Pacers team. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=127.16s)]
*  They had like six or seven players [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=128.52s)]
*  in double figures last night. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=130.08s)]
*  That's what wins ball games. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=131.38s)]
*  But Holly Burton closes out. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=132.64s)]
*  He knows how to close out a game. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=134.24s)]

*  There's a lot of stars in the NBA. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=139.28s)]

*  He does look good in the clutch. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=145.0s)]

*  and have people putting you in that conversation. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=148.72s)]

*  That he could be the face of the league. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=152.36s)]
*  You gotta have more than 14 points in the NBA finals game. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=153.48s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=156.12s)]

*  Make Paces beat the Thunder last night [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=230.88s)]
*  if you went to sleep early, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=232.6s)]
*  like Charlamagne said a little bit. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=233.48s)]
*  You missed it, OKC was up 14 at one point. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=234.92s)]
*  They were up six with two minutes left, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=237.32s)]
*  but the Paces came back and won last night, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=239.66s)]
*  111-110 to lead the NBA Finals, game one. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=241.32s)]
*  What's up, Morgan? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=245.76s)]
*  What's up is this bromance breakup [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  that appears to be happening [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=249.12s)]
*  between President Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  Snatching wigs and edges and all types of stuff. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=252.12s)]
*  But look at this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=254.72s)]
*  All right, so maybe we can get a little bit of rest. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=255.56s)]
*  Yes, the girls are fighting. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=258.44s)]
*  So President Trump says he doesn't know [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=260.56s)]
*  if he and Elon Musk will continue [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  to have a great relationship. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=263.44s)]
*  His comments in the Oval Office came days [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=264.68s)]
*  after Musk criticized Trump's so-called [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=267.3s)]
*  one big beautiful bill. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=269.24s)]
*  Now it's important to note [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  that the President's comments came early in the day [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=271.72s)]
*  and the drama between him and Elon Musk progressed [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=273.88s)]
*  as the day went on. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=276.72s)]
*  But Trump initially had, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=277.68s)]
*  here's what Trump initially had to say yesterday [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=279.6s)]
*  regarding Elon Musk and those comments that came out. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  You saw the words he had for me, the words. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=284.48s)]
*  And yes, it said anything about me that's bad. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=287.28s)]
*  I'd rather have him criticize me than the bill [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=289.84s)]
*  because the bill is incredible. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=291.88s)]
*  Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=294.4s)]
*  and which was a lot of money for electric vehicles. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=297.52s)]
*  Elon and I had a great relationship. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=301.2s)]
*  I don't know if we'll anymore. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Charlemagne, you called it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=307.4s)]
*  You called it about those EV vehicles. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=309.55999999999995s)]
*  You said he's, what is he gonna be mad at? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=311.73999999999995s)]
*  It's gonna be one of two things. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=313.23999999999995s)]
*  Now Trump said he and Musk, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=314.96s)]
*  Trump said he asked Musk to leave his administration. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=316.56s)]
*  Trump said Musk was upset that he was ending the EV mandate [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=319.68s)]
*  which will cost Musk billions of dollars. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  Now Trump also said the Tesla CEO was disappointed. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  Trump did not, or he decided not to go [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  with his preferred head of NASA. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=330.56s)]
*  And the President threatened to terminate, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=332.88s)]
*  as we said, Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=334.64s)]
*  Now Musk said Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=338.28s)]
*  was never shown to him and passed in the House [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  in a deal and in the dead of night. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=343.2s)]
*  He also reposted an image showing old tweets from Trump [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  that appeared to contradict his spending bill saying, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=348.52s)]
*  where's this guy today? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=351.4s)]
*  Musk has been highly critical of this beautiful bill [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=353.08s)]
*  since his time ending [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=356.0s)]
*  as a special government employee for Doge. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=357.32s)]
*  Now the Tesla CEO also made a post claiming [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=359.88s)]
*  the reason the Jeffrey Epstein files [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=362.32s)]
*  haven't been made public is because Trump is in them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=365.32s)]
*  Musk posted a time to drop the really big bomb [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=368.28s)]
*  before saying Trump is in the files. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=371.64s)]
*  Now the financier and convicted sex offender [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=374.12s)]
*  died back in 2019 by suicide [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=376.12s)]
*  and the public has long called [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=378.04s)]
*  for the release of the documents, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=379.68s)]
*  including a contact list of names. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=381.0s)]
*  Now the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, also claims [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  that Trump would not have won the election without him. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=386.16s)]
*  Musk responded to a post calling [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=389.52s)]
*  for President Trump to be impeached, saying yes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=391.64s)]
*  Yeah, so what do you guys think about all of this drama? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=395.52s)]
*  Even though I said this was gonna happen months ago, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=398.92s)]
*  I don't particularly believe this right now. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=401.28s)]
*  I think it's all wrestling. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=404.28s)]
*  Elon has lost like $100 billion since December. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=405.67999999999995s)]
*  He lost like 26 billion yesterday. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=408.44s)]
*  I think that a lot of this is just to try [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=410.44s)]
*  to rehabilitate Elon's image [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=412.52s)]
*  to get his companies back on track. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=414.44s)]
*  But I think that's a wrap. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=416.32s)]
*  Elon is gonna have to step down as a CEO. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  I won't believe this until some of those government contracts [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=419.2s)]
*  actually get pulled. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=422.32s)]
*  Threatening the government contracts to get pulled [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=424.08s)]
*  is one thing, actually pulling them is another. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=426.4s)]
*  That's when I believe some of this is real. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=429.15999999999997s)]
*  That Epstein-Fau's thing to me is a nothing burger. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=431.88s)]
*  Yeah, that was just a shot. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=433.64s)]
*  But the problem is, Elon Musk, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=434.84s)]
*  he gave Trump what, $277 million for his campaign. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  The problem is with a lot of those EV companies, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  and this is the F-ed up part, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden put it into play that a majority of your fleet [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=443.68s)]
*  or the majority of the cars that you sell have to be EV, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=447.24s)]
*  I think by 2026. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=450.4s)]
*  So a lot of these manufacturers changed to EV. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=452.34s)]
*  We're trying to sell EV. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=454.76s)]
*  And if you look at all these lots, nobody wants to buy EV. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=456.12s)]
*  These cars are not selling. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=459.0s)]
*  They're practically giving them away [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=460.12s)]
*  to the fact where a Hummer during COVID [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  was like $1,500 a month if you wanted to lease it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=463.76s)]
*  Now, that same Hummer I seen yesterday for 400 and change. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=466.12s)]
*  Like they're just trying to give these cars away. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=469.12s)]
*  Nobody wants them. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  And these people are gonna be losing [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=471.64s)]
*  billions and billions of dollars. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=472.96s)]
*  Yeah, but Trump said Elon knew [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=474.4s)]
*  that that was gonna be in the bill. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  So he said, he said, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=477.0s)]
*  Elon knew that was gonna be in the bill the whole time. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=477.84s)]
*  Elon said he never seen the bill. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=479.32s)]
*  Well, people need to start reading. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=481.0s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  And that Epstein-Fau's thing is really a nothing burger [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=484.0s)]
*  because the flight logs of Epstein's plane came out [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=487.0s)]
*  and Trump was on those. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=491.28s)]
*  So it was a lot of other people. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=492.72s)]
*  Well, you seen pictures on with. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=493.56s)]
*  Like Bill Clinton, yeah, Trump and Epstein have been in, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=494.38s)]
*  they got video of them in parties together, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=496.92s)]
*  picking out girls. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=498.64s)]
*  And plus Trump is already president. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=500.12s)]
*  So what is Trump and the Epstein-Fau's gonna do? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=502.32s)]
*  I don't know, make him worse than what he already does. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=505.24s)]
*  What, Donald Trump? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=507.6s)]
*  Donald, listen, Donald Trump is Teflon. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=508.92s)]
*  And it's like, come on, stop. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=511.84s)]
*  Like when he said, I can walk in the middle [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=513.44s)]
*  of whatever street and shoot somebody in the head [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=515.6s)]
*  and nobody will care, he was absolutely positively right. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  He won a whole election. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  Nobody is gonna care that Donald Trump [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=522.84s)]
*  is in the Epstein-Fau. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=524.48s)]

*  I am so excited that Elon Musk told on Trump. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=649.88s)]
*  What'd he tell on Trump about? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=654.56s)]
*  Because, well, he said that he wouldn't [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=655.7199999999999s)]
*  have won the election without him. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=658.0s)]
*  Now see, that's a bigger conversation, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=659.68s)]
*  because you remember everybody was saying that, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, put that, and I'm just throwing this out, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=662.6s)]
*  because this was a conspiracy theory [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=664.88s)]
*  that, you know, the election might've been rigged, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=665.7199999999999s)]
*  and, you know, Elon had something to do with it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  That right there is a little bit more of a telling statement [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=669.5999999999999s)]
*  than the Epstein files one. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=671.8s)]
*  It is, because I wish Kamala had requested [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=673.24s)]
*  for a recount, a revote, whatever you call it. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=677.92s)]
*  Yeah, but even, but you know what, though, even if, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=681.48s)]
*  because he bragged, oh, I'm sorry. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=683.36s)]
*  He bragged on CNN about sending Elon Musk to Pennsylvania, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=685.04s)]
*  and how he's such an awesome guy, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  and he checked out the voting machines, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=693.48s)]
*  and three seconds later, he said, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=695.44s)]
*  did you see how fast those votes came in? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=696.96s)]
*  And the whole country like turned red overnight. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=700.32s)]
*  Yeah, and you remember when Joe Rogan, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=703.44s)]
*  Joe Rogan was saying that Elon Musk [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  had developed some type of custom app, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=708.2s)]
*  and he knew the results of the election. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=710.1600000000001s)]
*  Before. Before, yeah. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=712.84s)]
*  You know, so I mean, to me, that's a bigger thing [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=714.32s)]
*  than, you know, the Epstein files, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=716.5200000000001s)]
*  but you know, we get so caught up in foolishness, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=718.44s)]
*  we don't actually pay attention [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=720.96s)]
*  to what people be talking about. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=722.0s)]
*  But even when he ran against Hillary, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=723.2s)]
*  there was interruption from Russia. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=725.6400000000001s)]
*  So he didn't win that election either. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=728.48s)]
*  Well. He rigged it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=730.48s)]
*  But that's his history. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=732.24s)]
*  He always deals with stuff. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=733.9200000000001s)]
*  Oh, we can't say for sure that it was rigged. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=735.32s)]
*  Thank you, mama. You know. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=737.5600000000001s)]

*  Well, it's the latest. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1150.36s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1151.36s)]
*  Talk to me. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1152.36s)]
*  Well, I know you guys know, game one went down. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1154.36s)]
*  The Indiana Pacers won 111 over Oklahoma City Thunder, 110. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1156.4399999999998s)]
*  But Jay-Z has reportedly bet a million dollars that the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1161.4399999999998s)]
*  Oklahoma City Thunder will win the finals and gain, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1165.4399999999998s)]
*  will win the finals. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1170.4399999999998s)]
*  Now, here's the issue. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1171.4399999999998s)]
*  So he places a million dollar bet with the Fanatic Sports [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1173.4399999999998s)]
*  Book, which is, you know, Michael Rubin's company. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1176.4399999999998s)]
*  And if you win... [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1178.4399999999998s)]
*  Jay-Z's company too. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1179.4399999999998s)]
*  I didn't know that Jay-Z owned part of it. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1181.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1183.52s)]
*  So while he placed the bet with their company and if he [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1184.52s)]
*  wins, he will profit 2.3 million dollars. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1187.52s)]
*  But he'll also... [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1189.52s)]
*  I thought it was like 3.3. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1190.52s)]
*  Listen, so he'll profit 2.3 million dollars on top of what [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1192.52s)]
*  he already bet. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1197.52s)]
*  So it'll be a total of 3.3 million dollars. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1198.52s)]
*  Oh, gotcha, gotcha. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1200.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1201.52s)]
*  So he'll win 2.3. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1202.52s)]
*  He'll get his million dollars back. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1203.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1204.52s)]
*  So total will be 3.3, but the profit will be the 2.3. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1205.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1206.52s)]
*  So this, but this means that the Thunder can't lose more than [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1207.52s)]
*  one game of the seven game series. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1209.52s)]
*  Huh? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1212.6s)]
*  He won that the OKC won in five. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1213.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1215.6s)]
*  So yeah, so yeah, like I said. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1216.6s)]
*  Great promotion for Fanatics, you know what I'm saying? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1217.6s)]
*  Jay-Z's a company, you can do that? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1219.6s)]
*  That's why I was a little confused. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1221.6s)]
*  Maybe that's why I was reported that way, because in the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1223.6s)]
*  reports it all runs back to Michael Rubin, but... [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1225.6s)]
*  Well, Jay-Z placed his bets with the gambling side. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1227.6s)]
*  He owns, I mean, it's good business, like, you know, like, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1229.6s)]
*  I mean, it's public knowledge that he invested in Fanatics. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1231.6s)]
*  Not like it's a secret. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1234.6s)]
*  Well, it is great. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1235.6s)]
*  No, no, but what I'm asking... [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1236.6s)]
*  I mean, well, I guess I'm not asking, but I didn't know that [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1238.6s)]
*  you can do that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1240.6s)]
*  Like, if you own something, isn't that... [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1241.6799999999998s)]
*  What would that be? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1243.6799999999998s)]
*  Conflict of ventures? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1244.6799999999998s)]
*  He can bet and he own the company? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1245.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1247.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know if that's a problem, because he doesn't [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1248.6799999999998s)]
*  own the teams. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1250.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like you control whether or not the teams win or lose. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1251.6799999999998s)]
*  Win or lose, yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1253.6799999999998s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1254.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know how that bet is going to turn out, though. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1255.6799999999998s)]
*  OKC would have to win four games in a row. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1257.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to happen. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  After last night, Indiana is a very solid, deep, balanced team. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1261.6799999999998s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1264.6799999999998s)]
*  Charlamagne, you said on Brilliant Idiots that [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1266.6799999999998s)]
*  Hallie Burton would never be the face of the league. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1268.6799999999998s)]
*  No, he won't. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1270.76s)]
*  You still feel like that? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1271.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1272.76s)]
*  The face of the league? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1273.76s)]
*  No. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1274.76s)]
*  He's been in the league for six years already. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1275.76s)]
*  He's one of the nicest players in the league, but he's not. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1277.76s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Charlamagne on Brilliant Idiots. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1279.76s)]
*  I don't have a problem with Tyrese. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1281.76s)]
*  I just have somebody who loves Tyrese and thinks he's the face of the league, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1283.76s)]
*  and I'm like, no, he's not. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1286.76s)]
*  Tyrese can win the next two championships and wouldn't be the face of the league. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1287.76s)]
*  OK? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1290.76s)]
*  Why do you think? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1291.76s)]
*  Because he just don't have the... [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1292.76s)]
*  He doesn't think about the face of the league conversation. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1293.76s)]
*  Face of the league already is anointed of the league. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1295.76s)]
*  It's anointed upon you on your first day. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1299.84s)]
*  It just is. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1302.84s)]
*  I don't care if you're coming out of high school, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1303.84s)]
*  I don't care if you're coming out of college, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1305.84s)]
*  there's a light on you that is really just yours to fumble. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1307.84s)]
*  It's a fact. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1311.84s)]
*  He's not even the most famous Tyrese now. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1312.84s)]
*  People heard me saying that the first 30 seconds of the party [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1314.84s)]
*  I thought I was talking about Tyrese Gibson from Fast and Furious. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1317.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you got Joker, you got Luca, you got... [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1320.84s)]
*  None of those guys that have been face of the league, they're not from here. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1323.84s)]
*  They're not from America. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1325.84s)]
*  They still can be face of the league. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1326.84s)]
*  Tyrese got a better chance of being in because face of the league [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1327.84s)]
*  because he's from America. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1328.9199999999998s)]
*  A foreigner will never be face of the league. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1329.9199999999998s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1332.9199999999998s)]
*  No, it would already have happened. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  Will it be Yamu? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1335.9199999999998s)]
*  Will LeBron still in the league? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1336.9199999999998s)]
*  He's American. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1337.9199999999998s)]
*  Steph Curry's still in the league. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1338.9199999999998s)]
*  American. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1339.9199999999998s)]
*  But they're about to retire in the next couple of years [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1340.9199999999998s)]
*  and then there has to be a new face of the league. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1341.9199999999998s)]
*  A foreigner will never be face of the league. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1343.9199999999998s)]
*  If that was the case, Joker would have been face of the league. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1344.9199999999998s)]
*  Yannis would have been face of the league. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1346.9199999999998s)]
*  These guys have already won championships, MVPs. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1347.9199999999998s)]
*  But still not bigger than Braun and Steph. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1349.9199999999998s)]
*  Because Braun and Steph are American. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1351.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, I saw people yesterday re-posting Paul George's comments [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1353.9199999999998s)]
*  and he said, this was a couple days ago, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1357.0s)]
*  he said that he thinks that he is the face of the NBA. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1359.0s)]
*  He's the number one option. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1362.0s)]
*  Well, we shouldn't be listening to Paul George. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1364.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know who we should be listening to. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1366.0s)]
*  I'm just telling y'all what I saw. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1368.0s)]
*  These are all opinions. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1369.0s)]
*  Opinions are like butt holes. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1370.0s)]
*  Everybody got them. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1371.0s)]
*  I mean, listen, I just don't see. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1372.0s)]
*  Tyrese is a great player. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1373.0s)]
*  He does. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1374.0s)]
*  He is. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1375.0s)]
*  Super in the clutch. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1376.0s)]
*  He's just not going to be face of the league. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1377.0s)]
*  Face of the league, you think LeBron, Steph Curry, historically, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1378.0s)]
*  Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Tyrese not going to be that. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1382.0s)]
*  He's going to be a good player though. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1385.0s)]
*  I think a foreigner can be the face of the league. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1386.08s)]
*  No. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1388.08s)]
*  Well, game two is set for Sunday, the Sunday at 8 p.m. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1389.08s)]
*  So it'll keep going. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1393.08s)]
*  In other news, I broke a story yesterday. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1395.08s)]
*  Portia Williams, I'm sorry, Kenya Moore. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1397.08s)]
*  You remember Kenya got that suspension off of World Housewives of Atlanta [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1400.08s)]
*  for the remainder of this current season. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1405.08s)]
*  So yesterday Kenya posted a statement to her Twitter [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1407.08s)]
*  and she basically was taking accountability for, you know, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1411.08s)]
*  the whole showing the photos thing, not showing the photos thing [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1415.1599999999999s)]
*  on World Housewives of Atlanta. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1418.1599999999999s)]
*  But it made people start asking if she is going to return back to the show. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1419.1599999999999s)]
*  And I was told by a source close to World Housewives of Atlanta production [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1422.1599999999999s)]
*  that Kenya Moore is not going anywhere anytime soon. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1426.1599999999999s)]
*  The statement that she actually posted, she took accountability, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1430.1599999999999s)]
*  but the last line of it, it said, I will see you guys back on Bravo very soon. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1433.1599999999999s)]
*  So that got the fans going. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1437.1599999999999s)]
*  And the person I spoke to said, I mean, rightfully so. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1439.1599999999999s)]
*  And there's also stories out there that Kenya Moore was supposed to be doing [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1442.24s)]
*  like a sit down conversation separate of the reunion [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1445.24s)]
*  because she wasn't allowed to film the reunion with Andy Cohen. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1447.24s)]
*  But that didn't end up happening. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1451.24s)]
*  But for the people that are wondering, you will see our girl back on Bravo. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1453.24s)]
*  I don't know how she'll be brought back in because she missed majority of the season, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1457.24s)]
*  but she will be back on the show. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1460.24s)]
*  OK, how you feel about that? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1462.24s)]
*  Because also Brittany Eadie posted yesterday, too. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1464.24s)]
*  That's the girl who alleged or they were alleging that Kenya posted those photos [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1467.24s)]
*  about during the season that she wasn't even in the photo. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1470.32s)]
*  She just found out that she was not even in the photos that Kenya got suspended for. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1473.32s)]
*  She wasn't over. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1477.32s)]
*  But if she wasn't in the photos, then why she get suspended? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1479.32s)]
*  So this is now the conversation that I had to take and then had to make a statement apologizing. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1481.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1486.32s)]
*  Come back. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1487.32s)]
*  I mean, there were photos shown, but now Brittany is saying that it was not her in the photos. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1488.32s)]
*  Brittany also was reportedly and mentioned not being at the reunion, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1493.32s)]
*  the filming of the reunion yesterday. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1496.32s)]
*  But I don't know what Bravo now will have to do and what they will have to say because there wasn't a whole investigation that happened. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1498.3999999999999s)]
*  And for all of this time, we believe that those photos were of Brittany and that, you know, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1503.3999999999999s)]
*  it was alleged revenge porn type of thing. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1507.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's why she was Kenya was removed from the show. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1510.3999999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, and this statement that Kenya actually made, I'm also told she made that statement prior to her even finding out about the whole Brittany not being in the photo thing and Brittany making her statement. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1512.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1522.3999999999999s)]
*  Because then what would my apology be for that? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1523.3999999999999s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1526.48s)]
*  But we will definitely find out because she's she ain't going nowhere anytime soon from what I'm told. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1527.48s)]
*  The baby sleep. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1531.48s)]
*  You need to bring back Nini. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1532.48s)]
*  Is the baby sleep, Jess? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1534.48s)]
*  Are you doing that? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1536.48s)]
*  The baby sleep? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1537.48s)]
*  Are you doing that Janet Jackson whisper thing? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1538.48s)]
*  I'm definitely not doing the Janet Jackson. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1540.48s)]
*  I'm definitely not. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1542.48s)]
*  But they need to bring back Nini. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1544.48s)]
*  That's just what it is. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1545.48s)]
*  I mean, so it can be interesting again. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1547.48s)]
*  It's really not interesting. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1548.48s)]
*  It's just caddy. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1550.48s)]
*  The new girl is like, I don't know. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1551.48s)]
*  The new girl is like the new girls are such fans. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1554.56s)]
*  They want to be down so bad and is is played. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1557.56s)]
*  So it's like that's the conversation right now is Nini, Portia, Kenya back for the next season. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1561.56s)]
*  Yeah, like, yeah. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1567.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if that works, but it seems like a structure to seem like these new the newer girls and the newer people that's on these shows are trying to do things to stay relevant. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1568.56s)]
*  Instead of letting it happen. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1577.56s)]
*  A lot of the older shows, things just happen and it seemed natural. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1578.56s)]
*  Now it just seems like it's forced. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1581.56s)]
*  But that's how it goes. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  You take a shot at whoever got the peach. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1583.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1585.6399999999999s)]
*  And it seemed like everything is fake and everything like you're letting like just for storyline. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1586.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, I did see Nini comment on our report yesterday. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  She put some hearts under our report and we talked about the fact that she said that her relationship is good with the network. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1593.6399999999999s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1599.6399999999999s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1600.6399999999999s)]
*  But I'll tell you one thing. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1601.6399999999999s)]
*  If it does happen, you guys might hear here first. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1602.6399999999999s)]

*  We are the Breakfast Club. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1690.8799999999999s)]
*  Let's get in some front page news. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1691.8799999999999s)]
*  Now last night, the Pacers beat the Thunder 111-110. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1693.8799999999999s)]
*  Now the Thunder was up pretty much the whole game. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1696.96s)]
*  They were up 14 at one point, up six I think with two minutes left. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1700.96s)]
*  And the Pacers came back and won last night 111-110. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1703.96s)]
*  Halliburton had the last shot which got them over that hump. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1706.96s)]
*  The Pacers really just don't quit. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1709.96s)]
*  I mean they're one of those teams that just refuse to die. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1711.96s)]
*  It's like herpes. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1713.96s)]
*  They never go away and they just keep flaring up, flaring up, flaring up. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1714.96s)]
*  And they play great team ball. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1717.96s)]
*  Like you know Halliburton only had 14 points last night but they had like seven figures [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1719.96s)]
*  in double digits. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1723.96s)]
*  Seven players. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1725.04s)]
*  Like six or seven players had like double figures. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1726.04s)]
*  And if not six or seven, one of them had close to double digits. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1728.04s)]
*  But they're a very, very deep team. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1733.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1735.04s)]
*  And also Aaron Rodgers, he signed with the Steelers. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1736.04s)]
*  He did a one year deal with the Steelers. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1738.04s)]
*  What's up Morgan? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1740.04s)]
*  Hey y'all, let's get back into this presidential news. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1741.04s)]
*  So Trump says he feels like trade talks with China are in very good shape. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1744.04s)]
*  Speaking from the Oval Office as he welcomed German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1748.04s)]
*  Trump confirmed he spoke with China. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1752.04s)]
*  He spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday morning. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1754.12s)]
*  Let's take a listen to Trump's comments regarding that conversation. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1757.12s)]
*  He had a very good talk. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1761.12s)]
*  And we've straightened out any complexity. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1762.12s)]
*  It's very complex stuff and we straighten it out. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1765.12s)]
*  We're going to have Scott and Howard and Jameson will be going and meeting with their top people [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1768.12s)]
*  and continue it forward. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1776.12s)]
*  But no, I think we have everything. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1778.12s)]
*  I think we're in very good shape with China and the trade deal. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1779.12s)]
*  So Trump described trade talks between the two countries as having a lot of complexities [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1783.1999999999998s)]
*  and the president also said teams from China and the U.S. will meet soon, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1787.1999999999998s)]
*  referencing Treasury Secretary Scott Benson and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1790.1999999999998s)]
*  He added that Xi, Chinese President Xi, invited him and the First Lady to come to China [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1795.1999999999998s)]
*  and he also extended the same invite to President Xi to come here. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1800.1999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, President Trump is banning travelers from dozens of countries citing security risk. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1804.1999999999998s)]
*  The proclamation signed on Wednesday evening fully restricts and limits the entry of nationals [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1809.28s)]
*  from 12 countries. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1814.28s)]
*  That list includes Afghanistan, Iran, Haiti, Somalia, Sudan and others. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1815.28s)]
*  Now people from seven countries will have partial restrictions, including Cuba and Venezuela. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1820.28s)]
*  The president said there's different levels of restrictions. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1825.28s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1828.28s)]
*  The list is subject to revision based on whether material improvements are made [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1830.28s)]
*  and likewise new countries can be added as threats emerge around the world. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1835.36s)]
*  The strength of the restrictions we're applying depends on the severity of the threat posed. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1840.36s)]
*  So as previously reported, Trump was back and forth on the decision with Sunday's anti-Semitic attack [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1846.36s)]
*  in Boulder, Colorado, putting things into quicker motion. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1852.36s)]
*  Now that suspect was in the U.S. illegally from Egypt, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1855.36s)]
*  but Egypt is not one of the countries included on the travel ban. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1859.36s)]
*  Immigration advocates are speaking out after President Trump signed an order banning travelers [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1863.4399999999998s)]
*  from those dozen countries. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1868.4399999999998s)]
*  Florida immigration coalition Thomas Kennedy calls this un-American, restrictive and racist. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1870.4399999999998s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1876.4399999999998s)]
*  I think this is highly disruptive to the family life of thousands and thousands and thousands of people [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1878.4399999999998s)]
*  who live in our community, particularly here in South Florida, but really across the country. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1884.4399999999998s)]
*  I would suspect that this would get ultimately banned. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1888.4399999999998s)]
*  I would suspect that this would get ultimately enjoined by a court because of its broad scope, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1891.52s)]
*  because it's likely to be found discriminatory. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1897.52s)]
*  Florida immigration coalition's Thomas Kennedy, he says many people are literal life-liness [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1900.52s)]
*  to their family in their home country. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1907.52s)]
*  So, you know, the move is expected, as he said, to face dozens of legal challenges. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1910.52s)]
*  And the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is calling for ICE detention oversight [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1915.52s)]
*  after migrants at a Miami detention center sent out an SOS message yesterday. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1919.6s)]
*  Now, CHC chair, Representative Adriano Espella of New York says they are going to hold [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1924.6s)]
*  the for-profit prison detention centers accountable. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1932.6s)]
*  And Representative Sylvia Garcia of Houston, Texas says she's deeply concerned about the conditions [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1936.6s)]
*  at detention centers like Chrome. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1940.6s)]
*  Let's take a listen to their comments. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1942.6s)]
*  So this is a crisis where we must determine whether these centers are motivated by the profit [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1944.6799999999998s)]
*  margins that they make and whether due process is being dramatically and vulgarly violated. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1952.6799999999998s)]
*  And making sure that we use the powers of oversight to protect the rights of all. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1959.6799999999998s)]
*  This is not happening at the moment. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1964.6799999999998s)]
*  What is happening, in my view, is just sinister, cruel, and inhumane. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1966.6799999999998s)]
*  So CHC members, that's the Congressional Hispanic Caucus members say they refuse to allow the [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1970.76s)]
*  Trump administration to tear families apart by locking up parents married to American [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1977.76s)]
*  citizens. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1981.76s)]
*  Chrome, which is one of those detention centers, ICE detention centers operated by a private [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1982.76s)]
*  contractor, has faced long scrutiny of overcrowding and poor conditions. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1986.76s)]
*  So it's amazing how a lot of these stories are starting to be relative, whether it's, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1990.76s)]
*  you know, the Harvard, excuse me, not Howard, but the Harvard immigration students and the [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=1995.84s)]
*  ban on them and then the judge blocking that ban and how that affects immigration and how [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2000.84s)]
*  immigration then turns around and impacts what's happening with ICE and the travel ban. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2005.84s)]
*  It's just a lot. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2010.84s)]
*  So I would just say, you know, happy Friday and enjoy your weekend if you can. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2011.84s)]
*  I know you give a donkey of the day or you allow people to give a donkey of the day. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2016.84s)]
*  If I had an opportunity to do that, I would just go ahead and give it to the whole government [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2020.84s)]

*  it going to disturb my peace? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2190.3599999999997s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2191.7599999999998s)]
*  Because you know when you're young, you just, you can have FOMO a little bit. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2192.7599999999998s)]
*  It's like, I got to go. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2196.28s)]

*  You know, no more of those moments because I'd rather be home with my fat Frenchies. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2200.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, I always want to ask you, has being an advocate for mental health ever made you [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2204.2400000000002s)]
*  feel more exposed than being just a public figure in Hollywood? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2207.8s)]
*  More exposed? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because you tell you tell more of yourself being a mental health advocate because you [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2213.2400000000002s)]
*  probably, if you was just Faraji in Hollywood who wasn't that, you wouldn't have to probably [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2216.32s)]
*  give up so much. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2220.28s)]
*  That's true. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2221.28s)]
*  But I kind of always been that. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2222.28s)]
*  So I wear my heart on my sleeve. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2223.92s)]
*  So I just, I don't know if I feel any different. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2226.08s)]
*  I'm still looking at this wall, but go ahead. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2230.04s)]

*  right? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2237.52s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2238.52s)]
*  We just had this conversation the other day where it was like, I got to a place a couple [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2239.52s)]
*  of years ago where I just say no. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2242.1200000000003s)]
*  Before it was like, I felt like I had to do it. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2243.6800000000003s)]
*  I had to show up. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2245.6800000000003s)]
*  I had to go. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2246.6800000000003s)]
*  And sometimes things F up your piece. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2247.6800000000003s)]
*  But now it's to the point where if I feel like the energy is going to be off or I just [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2249.8s)]
*  don't, nah, I'm not going. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2253.16s)]

*  The first one. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2278.8399999999997s)]
*  Because that refocused me, re-centered me. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2279.8399999999997s)]
*  I was, I didn't, I felt outside of myself before I went to Bali. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2283.0s)]
*  That was a well needed trip because I was literally losing myself. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2289.12s)]
*  I didn't even know who I was. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2292.96s)]
*  The joy. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2296.28s)]

*  And I become, I was like tight all the time and not happy and complaining a lot. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2301.24s)]
*  That's just not me. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2308.2s)]
*  Even my team noticed. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2309.96s)]
*  They were like, is everything okay? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2310.96s)]
*  You seem a little, you know? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2313.76s)]
*  And that's just not in my DNA. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  So I had to unplug and just go away and be with myself in the middle of a rice field. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2318.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, it made you want to share that with the world. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2325.76s)]
*  Cause I saw the CNN. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2328.2000000000003s)]
*  Cause I feel like people need to hear that. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2329.2000000000003s)]
*  I think sometimes when they see public figures, they think we have it all together because [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2331.08s)]
*  we've, you know, we've found some money or whatever. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2336.12s)]
*  You know, people think that money heals. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2339.7200000000003s)]
*  Money will bring you more problems than you had when you were broke. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2342.28s)]
*  I often find myself saying, damn, I miss when I was broke and dreaming. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2345.4s)]
*  Cause everything seemed possible, you know? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2350.2400000000002s)]
*  But then when you make it and you get behind the Wizard of Oz curtain and it's like, oh, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2353.0800000000004s)]
*  this ain't what it seems. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2359.2000000000003s)]
*  You're here for Straw. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2361.2000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2363.7200000000003s)]
*  Girl, very moving film. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2366.48s)]
*  You saw it. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2367.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2368.48s)]
*  Listen. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2369.48s)]
*  I'm going to go back to your channel because you are healing. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2370.48s)]
*  You mean your healing journey. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2373.0s)]
*  But to put yourself in a role like that, you had to go back. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2374.0s)]
*  That was a trying day. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2378.52s)]
*  So the movie was like, it took place one day. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2379.52s)]
*  To deal with all that in a day and to have to embody that much trauma. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2382.52s)]
*  Cause I don't want to give away the ending. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2386.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2389.2s)]
*  The ending is going to f**k you up. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2390.2s)]
*  What did you pull from? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2392.4s)]
*  Did you have to go put yourself back where you were, where you were going through everything? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2393.4s)]
*  Should be some bull**** Hollywood executives. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2398.5200000000004s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2400.5200000000004s)]
*  I am a single mother. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2402.96s)]
*  You know, I moved to Hollywood with my son who was a toddler at the time, $700 in my [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2404.32s)]
*  pocket and just a pocket full of dreams and Jesus. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2408.5600000000004s)]
*  You know, humans, we all have, can have a moment where we can snap. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2412.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, I think what made me different from Jani is that I've always had a support system. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2417.1600000000003s)]
*  So I have a sister circle where they'll talk me off the ledge. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2423.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2427.2799999999997s)]
*  But have I ever got to the point where I wanted to snap? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2428.2799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2430.8399999999997s)]
*  That's why I went to Bali. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2431.8399999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2432.8399999999997s)]
*  So, but she didn't have the resources. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2433.8399999999997s)]
*  She didn't have the support. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2435.96s)]
*  So all she had was the voices in her head. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2437.7599999999998s)]
*  And she literally reached her point where she just couldn't take it anymore. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2441.3599999999997s)]
*  And things just got out of control and she, God bless her heart. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2445.6s)]
*  She was just trying to do the best she could with what she had. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2449.68s)]
*  And I, in particular, I am drawn to characters who are voiceless and need a voice because [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2454.6s)]
*  I am such a big personality. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2460.36s)]
*  I like to breathe light into those characters because I feel like those characters are real. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2462.48s)]
*  You know, Tyler Perry didn't just pull this out of the sky. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2468.12s)]
*  These women exist. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2470.8s)]
*  These people exist and they need to see themselves and they need to know that they're not alone [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2471.92s)]
*  and that people do see them. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2475.64s)]
*  Does it make you mad when people tell Tyler Perry to stop showing those women on camera? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2477.8s)]
*  I think that's their own traumas triggered because in the community, black community, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2481.8s)]
*  we don't deal with it. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2487.6400000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2489.0400000000004s)]
*  So if you're forced to look at it often, you will be triggered. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2490.0400000000004s)]
*  So the first thing you're going to want to say is, I don't want to see it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2492.88s)]
*  But there are people out there that need to see it. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2496.4s)]
*  He's forcing real conversations in the community. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2499.1600000000003s)]
*  That's why I'll never stop working with him. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2502.44s)]
*  So for a person that does the work on themselves the way you do, when you got to go on an intense [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2504.6000000000004s)]
*  emotional journey for a four day shoot, what is your approach to that? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2508.68s)]
*  Like how do you prepare for like those inevitable triggers? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2511.88s)]
*  I have trained, well I think out of necessity, I've trained my instrument. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2514.2s)]
*  My body is my instrument. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2520.0s)]
*  Just like, you know, a musician has a guitar, they know how to hit the notes. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2521.2s)]
*  I have an on and off switch and I think that's because I was a mother very young and when [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2525.16s)]
*  I would work and come home, I didn't have time to process and deal with the character [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2529.44s)]
*  that I portrayed because now it's homework. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2534.72s)]
*  He got to eat. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2536.36s)]
*  I had to do the side sphere project. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2537.4s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2538.4s)]
*  So I had to turn it off. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2539.4s)]
*  So I'm just literally, you ask anybody that I've worked with, I could be in the middle [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2541.32s)]
*  of a scene bawling my eyes out and they'll yell cut. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2546.44s)]
*  And I'll be like, where the fried chicken? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2549.2400000000002s)]
*  Or I have these games that I play on my iPad because I have to separate myself from the [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2554.96s)]
*  character. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2561.96s)]
*  I cannot stay again. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2562.96s)]
*  That is that character's trauma. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2565.6s)]
*  I can't take that on. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2567.2s)]
*  I just can't because I have my own. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2569.16s)]
*  So literally when they yell cut, I'm back to Taraji just like that. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2571.16s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Taraji P. Henson. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2575.2s)]
*  Laura Roses here with us as well. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2577.16s)]
*  Jess, somebody in the movie said it's more expensive to be poor. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2579.16s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2583.48s)]
*  Okay, so prime example. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2584.48s)]
*  Tyler said when he was homeless, he called his mother and was like, can you send me $20? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  She said you need to bring your black ass home because it's going to cost me $15 just [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2593.92s)]
*  to send you $20. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2598.28s)]
*  And I don't think people really understand that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2600.9s)]
*  I wanted to know without giving too much away, what's the message in straw that you hope [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2604.36s)]
*  sticks with people after the credits roll? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2608.36s)]
*  So there was women unity. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2610.36s)]
*  There was so much about it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2612.2400000000002s)]
*  What's that one message that you want people to get it and understand? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2613.96s)]
*  That we should move with grace at all times because you never know what somebody's going [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2616.16s)]
*  through. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2620.44s)]
*  Never judge a book by its cover. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2621.44s)]
*  You never know what battles a person is or fighting. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2622.96s)]
*  You just don't and really see people really don't just throw how you doing and really [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2627.32s)]
*  wait for a response and really ask the question to want to know. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2632.92s)]
*  Connect with people, say hi, how are you and really mean it because that could save a human's [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2637.7200000000003s)]
*  life. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2643.36s)]
*  Just that human interaction, especially for people who feel unseen. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2644.36s)]
*  I wonder when Tyler even was casting you for that role, did he even know what you had went [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2647.72s)]
*  through? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2652.64s)]
*  Because if I write a role about somebody getting to their breaking point, knowing somebody [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2653.64s)]
*  already had got one, it feels kind of... [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2655.8199999999997s)]
*  Tyler and I are friends of hers and so we talk all the time about personal things and [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2657.7s)]
*  so he knows a lot about me. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2662.7599999999998s)]
*  But he said when he started writing, he just had to, he was going through his own thing [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2665.52s)]
*  and he had to get it out and on the page. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2671.44s)]
*  And then he said as he was writing, he saw me and he'll bring me a lot of projects and [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2673.96s)]
*  I'll be like, you know what, Tyler, I don't think this is for me. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2678.12s)]
*  I think this is somebody else's blessing, you know? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2680.6s)]
*  And then he'll just keep writing it. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2683.92s)]
*  When he got straw, he said, he hit me, he said, I got one for you and he sent it to [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2686.12s)]
*  me and I read it. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2690.58s)]
*  I said, this is it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2691.58s)]
*  This is the one. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2692.58s)]
*  So that's kind of how we operate. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2694.16s)]
*  How do you not fight somebody over Tyler? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2696.28s)]
*  How do I not? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2698.12s)]
*  How do you not fight because they attack Tyler a lot. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2699.12s)]
*  Tyler got security? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2701.92s)]
*  No, not like that. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2703.32s)]
*  Not like that. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2704.32s)]
*  But online because he does so much for people and he's so good to, especially our community. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2705.32s)]
*  And I think a lot of times people don't see that. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2710.44s)]
*  And even people that he doesn't know, he helps so much. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2712.6800000000003s)]
*  He talks to, he guides, he mentors and you guys are so close. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2715.2400000000002s)]
*  How do you not just say, you know what, sometimes I got a black out on somebody. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2718.76s)]
*  Because his action speaks louder than the haters because this man owns a studio, which [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2721.2000000000003s)]
*  you got. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2725.56s)]
*  Every raise that I've gotten, whenever I'm treated the best in this industry, it's always [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2727.88s)]
*  by him. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2733.0s)]
*  Every raise that I've gotten has come from a black man, Tyler Perry. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2734.0s)]
*  He doubled my quote and straw. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2738.56s)]
*  Four days of work. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  Which is so important for when you go on to that next step. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2742.88s)]
*  He understands that. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2745.04s)]
*  That man has helped. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2746.52s)]
*  He does so much that we don't even know because he's not even talking about it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2748.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2753.1600000000003s)]
*  You filmed two movies at the same time, Fight Night and Straw, right? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2754.24s)]
*  Did you find the two characters bleeding into each other? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2758.7999999999997s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2761.8399999999997s)]
*  Totally different. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2762.8399999999997s)]
*  He was the first director to challenge me in that way because I was in the thrills of [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2763.8399999999997s)]
*  Empire when he called with Acrimony. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2768.3999999999996s)]
*  And I was like, Tyler, I don't know. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2771.12s)]
*  I don't know if I can get into this character. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2773.7599999999998s)]
*  He was like, girl, with your instrument, you can do it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2776.48s)]
*  He was like, you're going to come down here. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2779.2799999999997s)]
*  We're going to shoot it in five. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2780.2799999999997s)]
*  I was like, five days? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2781.2799999999997s)]
*  He said, you can do it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2782.4s)]
*  If anybody can do it to Roger, you can do it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2783.4s)]
*  And he challenged me. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2785.5600000000004s)]
*  He knows I love a good challenge. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2786.5600000000004s)]
*  I lean into roles that scare the shit out of me because I have to grow in some way or [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2788.6800000000003s)]
*  change or be transcended or something. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2793.28s)]
*  And that's what I want from my audience. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2796.1600000000003s)]
*  And if I'm not doing it as the artist, then how is the audience going to transform? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2797.76s)]
*  So I lean into challenges. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2801.76s)]
*  And he knows that about me because he's a Virgo as well. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2804.2400000000002s)]
*  And so now I'm a pro at it because of Tyler. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2807.0800000000004s)]
*  So when he called this time, I didn't even think about it. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2811.0s)]
*  I was like, great, four days in and out. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2813.08s)]
*  OK, let's go. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2814.92s)]
*  You think the industry is finally catching up to your range? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2815.92s)]
*  Are you still underestimated in certain roles? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2818.72s)]
*  Just as an actress? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2821.56s)]
*  No, I think they get it. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2824.4s)]
*  I think I'm at a really particular point in my, a special place in my career where I've [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2826.88s)]
*  done so much that I can't just do anything anymore because y'all will be like, why should [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2833.04s)]
*  you do that? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2838.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2839.56s)]
*  You know, it's just looking for that right material and it doesn't come like that. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2841.44s)]
*  So that my fans are frustrated because I'll post a pretty picture. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2847.04s)]
*  They're like, that's cute. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2849.64s)]
*  When your next movie coming out? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2850.64s)]
*  It's like, I have to be very particular about what I'm choosing now. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2851.64s)]
*  And some of this stuff doesn't exist and I have to create it. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2856.36s)]
*  And so that takes a little longer. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2859.08s)]
*  What age were you when you did Empire? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2861.24s)]
*  That was 10 years. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2864.2s)]
*  It was, I was 45. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2865.7s)]
*  It was 2015. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2867.24s)]
*  The reason why I asked you that is because I saw your interview where you talked about [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2868.84s)]
*  your overseas and how people received you overseas and you, you realized then how big [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2871.8s)]
*  us overseas were like that whole thing. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2876.92s)]
*  And I'm wondering right now in your career, you just said you can't do anything and the, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2879.28s)]
*  you get into these different levels so early in your career, even though you've been our [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2883.56s)]
*  Taraji forever. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2888.1600000000003s)]
*  What are new experiences that you're having just in your celebrity life at where you are [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2889.84s)]
*  right now in your career that we might've thought that you've already experienced before? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2892.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2896.8s)]
*  I guess for me it's always, cause I, people always go, do you not know who you are? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2897.8s)]
*  Like I went to the, I still like to go to the grocery store and buy my own damn produce. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2903.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2907.36s)]
*  Like by Empire you were iconic to us already. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2908.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2910.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2911.44s)]
*  But you know, after so many years of being told by the industry, oh, no one knows you [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2912.44s)]
*  overseas and then I get overseas and they're like, Taraji, please, please, picture, picture. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2917.7200000000003s)]
*  That still throws me. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2922.5600000000004s)]
*  I just came back from Cannes and it's the age range for me. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2925.16s)]
*  It's like the grandma all the way down sometimes to the great grandchildren and I'm leaving [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2929.0s)]
*  Cannes and I forget, you know, I'm overseas. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2933.48s)]
*  I'm like, don't nobody know me. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2935.48s)]
*  All of a sudden I get crowded by this, a group of people and then over in the corner I see [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2937.2799999999997s)]
*  these young boys and it's like a soccer team or something and they're standing there with [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2943.04s)]
*  their camera and I just- [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2947.24s)]
*  Hey, Miss Hanson. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2949.52s)]
*  I don't even think they spoke fluent English, but they knew exactly who I was because one [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2950.96s)]
*  of them said, that's Tito Shee. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2957.08s)]
*  And I was like, babies, come on. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2959.84s)]
*  And they all gathered and I'm telling, I'm like, maybe 10, but that always throws me [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2961.84s)]
*  when the babies know who I am. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2968.0s)]
*  You know, I'm just like, dang, I'm still relevant. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2970.28s)]
*  Well, round of applause for Taraji being 54 years old. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2972.68s)]
*  Why would you ever want a young girl when black women age like that? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2975.8s)]
*  I hope you didn't mind me asking you that. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2978.68s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2981.68s)]
*  I tell people my age because I hate that women, we feel ashamed of age and when men can have [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2982.68s)]
*  beard bellies, balding, sorry. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2989.12s)]
*  He's not balding. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2991.48s)]
*  He's been gay. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2993.48s)]
*  I gave up a long time ago. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2995.48s)]
*  Put your head down. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2998.48s)]
*  We can kind of see where the hairline used to be. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=2999.48s)]
*  I got a haircut yesterday. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3000.48s)]
*  But you understand what I mean? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3001.48s)]
*  And then they can have a young thing on their arm and we let that pass and we have to be [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3002.48s)]
*  ashamed of our age. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3008.32s)]
*  No, I'm not doing it. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3009.32s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Taraji P. Henson. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3010.32s)]
*  Lauren Rose is here with us as well. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3012.6s)]
*  You feel appreciated more? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3014.7200000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3015.7200000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3016.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't look, you know, it's like it's interesting because you go, I didn't get nominated for [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3017.7200000000003s)]
*  this award again. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3024.28s)]
*  Did you see the powerful talk that Denzel did about how he got bitter? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3025.96s)]
*  I mean, that was me. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3031.28s)]
*  That was me. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3033.2s)]
*  And it particularly happened after Hidden Figures. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3034.2s)]
*  I was like, what do I have to do? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3036.92s)]
*  Like, you know, y'all didn't see the range there? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3040.48s)]
*  I'm still playing cookie. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3045.12s)]
*  And then I gave you a rocket scientist. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3046.12s)]
*  Like what? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3048.56s)]
*  And that hurt a little bit. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3050.56s)]
*  But again, it hurt because of the power I placed in man's hand. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3052.32s)]
*  But if you step back from that and take that power back, look how many black girls are [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3057.76s)]
*  coding now. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3062.2400000000002s)]
*  Not even black girls, young kids, kids period. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3063.38s)]
*  So that's what I always wanted. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3067.36s)]
*  And that's what I asked God. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3069.1600000000003s)]
*  I said, I want longevity and I want the work that's going to affect lives in a positive [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3070.1600000000003s)]

*  Like I did the greats that came before me. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3082.4s)]
*  You know, and when you ask that, that's specific. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3084.7200000000003s)]
*  It may not be the awards, you know, I figure if I keep working that s*** will come. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3087.52s)]
*  What's rewarding to me are when fans come up to me and go, babe, that last, it touched [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3093.72s)]
*  me. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3100.04s)]
*  It made me change the way I, you know, think about things. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3101.04s)]
*  Like that's rewarding to me. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3104.32s)]
*  You know, it's funny because we were talking on the phone yesterday and she was just saying [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3105.68s)]
*  how much of a fan of you she is. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3110.08s)]
*  I mean, Jess is well aware, but I'm just like, there's nothing wrong with expressing that. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3111.44s)]
*  Share that with her because you just existing provides that inspiration. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3116.0s)]
*  And then she shamed me because I was just like, I was like, you damn right. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3118.7599999999998s)]
*  We saw Taraji, I saw Taraji in the theaters for baby boy. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3121.7999999999997s)]
*  She was like, you saw baby boy in theaters? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3124.6s)]
*  She made you feel old. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3126.7999999999997s)]
*  I've never thought about baby boy in a movie theater. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3129.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know about it on BET. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3132.7999999999997s)]
*  How old are you? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3133.7999999999997s)]
*  Are you illegal? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3134.7999999999997s)]
*  She's 33. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3135.7999999999997s)]
*  She's 33. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3136.7999999999997s)]
*  She's older than my son. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3137.7999999999997s)]
*  But I don't know Jess, how you feel, but I feel like wanting to be in entertainment, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3138.7999999999997s)]
*  be in television. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3146.52s)]
*  Like it's you think of you because you're able to be, it always seemed like you've been [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3147.52s)]
*  able to be yourself. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3151.56s)]
*  So when we were like, I know for myself, when I heard you talk about that before that first [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3152.56s)]
*  Bali trip, not feeling like enough, I'm like, wait, what? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3156.0s)]
*  Like she's been the, this is how you can be the girl from where you from around the way, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3159.2799999999997s)]
*  whatever you want to call it. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3163.56s)]
*  But like you're in Hollywood and you're graceful and your beauty and your career impacts. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3164.88s)]
*  So I, I'm glad you're out of that because I was like, what? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3168.7599999999998s)]
*  This is the Taraji P Henson. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3172.48s)]
*  Like it was actual burnout because of the work. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3173.92s)]
*  You know, people go, you work a lot. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3178.16s)]
*  I too, because the math ain't math and the zeros ain't adding up, you know? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3179.76s)]
*  And so because you see somebody working a lot, a lot of times when it's us, it's because [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3184.84s)]
*  that one job is not going to cover you for the year. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3190.6000000000004s)]
*  I wish I could just do two films and be like, I mean, I'm kind of to that point now, you [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3193.2400000000002s)]
*  know what I mean? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3197.6400000000003s)]
*  But there are actors out there that just one job a year because that's how they get paid. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3198.6400000000003s)]
*  And I don't think people really understand the breakdown of the math. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3203.28s)]
*  You know, 50 cent, if somebody goes, they made $10 million, right? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3207.24s)]
*  You got to remember Uncle Sam is coming to take half of that off the top. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3212.12s)]
*  And then you have to pay your 30 or 40 percent, whatever you're paying your team off your [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3216.8399999999997s)]
*  gross. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3221.52s)]
*  So you're not taking home $10 million. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3222.8999999999996s)]
*  I know it sounds amazing, but you're not taking it home. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3225.48s)]
*  Somebody gets paid one million for a film. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3229.12s)]
*  They not seeing that one million in their bank account due to math. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3231.04s)]
*  You know, so that's why. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3235.12s)]
*  So I think a lot of it was burnout and frustration because once I lifted my head and was like, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3236.68s)]
*  why do I have to work so much? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3242.68s)]
*  You know, I just got burned out. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3244.8799999999997s)]
*  I became bitter. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3247.44s)]
*  You know, a lot of people thought you were kicking Tyler and Oprah's back in during the [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3248.7999999999997s)]
*  color purple. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3251.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3252.7599999999998s)]
*  Why would they think that? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3253.7599999999998s)]
*  I guess because they were the producers of the film and they thought that when you were [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3254.7599999999998s)]
*  complaining about the pay, you know, they had bosses, right? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3257.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3260.8399999999997s)]
*  And when have you ever seen me drag another woman, particularly a black woman? [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3262.84s)]
*  Ever. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3268.4s)]
*  I'm ten toes down for us. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3269.4s)]
*  Never. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3271.44s)]
*  And then the fact that blogs and I think it was just a campaign so that this black movie [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3272.56s)]
*  wouldn't do well. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3278.1200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3279.6000000000004s)]
*  Because to stay, I even saw some bits about it was my fault that the film didn't do well. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3280.6000000000004s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I saw that as well. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3287.2400000000002s)]
*  How? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3289.76s)]
*  They tried to say that because of the conversation you raised about the money and things that [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3290.96s)]
*  weren't right, it pivoted the focus to people aren't going to go see the film. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3294.44s)]
*  They care more about what is Taraji saying. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3298.1200000000003s)]
*  Is it true or not? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3300.0s)]
*  That's you know, that's total BS. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3301.0s)]
*  I know it is. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3302.36s)]
*  But I'm just telling you what the conversation what you're referring to or telling Jess with [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3303.36s)]
*  the conversation. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3307.2400000000002s)]
*  And me and Oprah, I have such a love and a fondness for her. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3308.2400000000002s)]
*  She just texted me the other day, commending me on a job well done and strong. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3311.2400000000002s)]
*  So that was all fixtures like and to draw a wedge between us. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3315.8s)]
*  But see, I'm not going to let you do that because I went to her defense right away. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3319.92s)]
*  You're not going to do that to this woman. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3322.96s)]
*  All of this what she does. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3324.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, like, stop it. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3326.1200000000003s)]
*  Stop that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3327.6000000000004s)]
*  Even with Tyler, you know, Tyler is the person that pays you the most. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3329.48s)]
*  What? I'm never going to not work with Tyler. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3332.08s)]
*  That's just that's insane to me. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3334.6000000000004s)]

*  I love that he challenges me. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3341.36s)]
*  I understand. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3343.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm never going to turn my back on us. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3345.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, people that go to the Tyler Perry films is a huge population of us. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3348.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3353.52s)]
*  Like, so for me to say I'm not going to do it, but that's me turning my back on us. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3354.04s)]
*  I would never. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3357.52s)]

*  because they identify with her. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3373.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3374.6s)]
*  What is, you know, not even the importance, but like when people watch those moments [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3375.48s)]
*  throughout the movie, what do you want them to take from that? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3381.0s)]
*  That we are we need each other and we're more powerful when we support each other. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3382.88s)]

*  You can't look at jurors? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3675.04s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3676.04s)]
*  So you can look at jurors, but I'm going to read the judge's exact words. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3677.04s)]
*  Judge was like, I want to make sure you're not flirting, okay? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3680.12s)]
*  You in here making eye contact with people bricked up. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3682.3599999999997s)]
*  Somebody must have complained beforehand and said it felt like it was intimidation. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3684.7599999999998s)]
*  I bet you that's what it was. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3688.48s)]
*  So here's the transcript. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3690.52s)]
*  So the judge put the jurors on the break, so they're not in the courtroom. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3692.64s)]
*  And then the judge asked for a minute with Diddy's attorney, Mark Agnifilio, right? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3697.04s)]
*  So he says, the judge says, I was very clear this morning that there were not to be any [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3700.8399999999997s)]
*  facial expressions or other attempts to have any interaction with the jury whatsoever, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3705.0s)]
*  any influence on the jury whatsoever. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3709.56s)]
*  And I could not have been more clear in terms of what I said. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3711.48s)]
*  You heard me, right? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3714.4s)]
*  And his attorney says, I did. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3715.4s)]
*  So then the judge says, well, there was a line of questioning where your client was [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3717.0s)]
*  nodding vigorously and looking at the jury. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3720.28s)]
*  And there was a subsequent moment, we had a sidebar and I looked and I saw your client [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3723.08s)]
*  looking at the jury and nodding vigorously during that line of questioning. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3727.52s)]
*  This is absolutely unacceptable. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3731.0s)]
*  Is it going to happen again, Mr. Agnifilio? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3733.04s)]
*  And then he says, it's not going to happen again. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3735.2400000000002s)]
*  And then the judge says, if it does happen again, he won't be allowed in this courtroom [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3736.56s)]
*  for the remainder of the trial. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3739.96s)]
*  Why do they make jurors public? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3741.36s)]
*  Like, why do they even let anybody see the jury? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3742.8s)]
*  I feel like jurors should have some type of an agreement. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3745.04s)]
*  Like a glass, like they should be behind one of the glasses. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3747.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3750.6400000000003s)]
*  I will say too, during the jury selection, it was one day we were all in line getting [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3752.2400000000002s)]
*  our cell phones together. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3756.08s)]
*  And I'm like, if any of these people was picked, I'm just right here. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3757.2000000000003s)]
*  Like we just all, we're media. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3759.32s)]
*  We're right here with them. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3760.56s)]
*  But not only that, think about this. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3761.32s)]
*  Some of the actual people that are testifying don't have to put their stuff out there. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3762.48s)]
*  Right? You don't know who they are. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3766.4s)]
*  They're anonymous. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3767.4s)]
*  But the jurors, you know who the jurors are through the whole trial? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3768.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3771.04s)]
*  I mean, we don't know their names and all that stuff, but you see them. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3771.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not hard to find. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3775.36s)]
*  But if you're a person of the media, there's a certain trust between the attorneys in the court. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3776.36s)]
*  Anybody in that courtroom, we've seen that. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3780.08s)]
*  The public being there. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3782.44s)]
*  You just said that people, like regular people, just be in there. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3783.56s)]
*  They do, but the judge doesn't, they have these whole things that they go through before [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3785.52s)]
*  they start, like, here's what we the court expect of you while you're here. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3789.2799999999997s)]
*  And this is what we actually to uphold. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3792.84s)]
*  They say the same thing to the jury as well. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3794.04s)]
*  So there's just like a... [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3795.4s)]
*  I ain't go front. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3796.48s)]
*  Did he try to do like a bus station? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3797.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3798.68s)]
*  You look like the Marlboro bus station or the Penn Station bus station. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3799.36s)]
*  Like anybody can see anybody. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3801.96s)]
*  Somebody I kicked out the other day I heard. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3804.28s)]
*  Yes, that's my girl though. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3805.96s)]
*  I don't know her name, but when my old girl tried to run down on me, she called me in [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3807.76s)]
*  the elevator after that and was like, because I was ready to... [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3812.6s)]
*  She be going off. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3814.6400000000003s)]
*  She's actually a sweetheart, but I don't know what that outburst was about. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3815.52s)]
*  Even the Jane Doe thing, right? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3818.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3819.56s)]
*  What's the point of letting somebody be a Jane Doe if everybody in the courtroom sees [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3820.2400000000002s)]
*  who it is and goes online and tells everybody who it is? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3823.76s)]
*  I have no idea because that happened yesterday with Jane Doe who testified. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3826.24s)]
*  She was one of Diddy's most recent ex-girlfriends and she barely even got through a lot of her [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3829.8799999999997s)]
*  testimony, but she talked about some things and by the time she started going through [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3834.7599999999998s)]
*  her testimony, I'm watching live tweets and I started seeing photos and I'm like, you're [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3838.9199999999996s)]
*  not supposed to do that. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3842.56s)]
*  So what does she say? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3843.7999999999997s)]
*  Did she say anything? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3844.4799999999996s)]
*  She just talked about the fact that they were really in love. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3845.9599999999996s)]
*  She was madly in love with him and with Diddy and she said that they had nicknames for each [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3848.24s)]
*  other, Bert and Ernie. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3852.4399999999996s)]
*  She was Bert. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3854.0s)]
*  Why can't you take me an Envy nickname? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3854.72s)]
*  Y'all got nicknames? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3858.16s)]
*  Bert and Ernie. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3859.2799999999997s)]
*  Jess, did you know that? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3860.2799999999997s)]
*  No. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3861.2799999999997s)]
*  I used to be as Bert and Ernie. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3862.2799999999997s)]
*  I know that, but in the Diddy situation, who was Bert and who was Ernie? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3863.2799999999997s)]
*  She was Bert and Diddy was Ernie. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3866.3599999999997s)]
*  That's why 50 posted that yesterday. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3868.24s)]
*  He posted a picture of Bert and Ernie yesterday. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3869.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3871.3999999999996s)]
*  I did. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3872.3999999999996s)]
*  Rubber Duckie with Diddy is nasty. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3873.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean that is just crazy. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3874.7999999999997s)]
*  Rubber Duckie, you're the one. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3876.68s)]
*  Baby, baby oil so much fun. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3879.68s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3882.2799999999997s)]
*  Y'all have done this before, huh? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3883.2799999999997s)]
*  Look at you all tickled in pink over there, Sharla May. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3884.28s)]
*  Envy, why are you this bitch in jujube sauce? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3886.8s)]
*  Now you act like you're not, Sharla? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3889.32s)]
*  What? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3891.32s)]
*  Diddy, back to Diddy. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3892.32s)]
*  It goes too far. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3894.32s)]
*  All right. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3895.32s)]
*  So Jane Doe on the stand and her testimony is actually going to speak to, or is supposed [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3896.32s)]
*  to be speaking to sex trafficking, forced coercion, all of those things. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3900.7200000000003s)]
*  But they, you know, they have to prove that all this was done under threat. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3905.2400000000002s)]
*  So far, everything she said is that she was super in love with Diddy at the time. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3908.0s)]
*  She didn't know anything about freak offs, but one day they were together and they were [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3912.12s)]
*  talking about fantasies and he talked about bringing another person in and she was like, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3916.16s)]
*  okay, cool. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3918.92s)]
*  I'll try that. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3919.92s)]
*  She said she got up, went to the bathroom. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3920.92s)]
*  She alleges by the time she came out the bathroom, Diddy was on a phone call making it happen. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3922.0s)]
*  So she's like, okay, well, here we go. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3925.7599999999998s)]
*  It's happening sooner than I thought. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3927.3599999999997s)]
*  Wait, because we already had the people on standby. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3928.8399999999997s)]
*  Craigslist. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3933.52s)]
*  Period. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3934.52s)]
*  And then they talked about, you know, like her career and stuff, because at one point [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3935.52s)]
*  she says that she was thinking about making the OnlyFans and he encouraged her not to [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3941.64s)]

*  I'm thinking about starting the OnlyFans. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3952.44s)]
*  Girl, if you don't go to the trade, don't learn to trade. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3953.44s)]
*  Well, she's an influencer online. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3954.44s)]

*  Well, there was one point that a lot of people were bringing up of like, you know, when they [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3957.44s)]
*  first went on like their first away trip or whatever, you know how guys be like, well, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3965.08s)]

*  Whatever. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3970.52s)]
*  So she alleged that she didn't go to work and their first date lasted like five days [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3972.48s)]
*  and Diddy allegedly gave her like $10,000 to make up for what she had missed at work. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3976.6s)]
*  People start breaking it down like, yo, that's like seven to $800 a day. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3981.7599999999998s)]
*  Five day date? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3985.24s)]
*  That's $2,000 a day. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3986.24s)]
*  That's my five day date. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3987.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3988.92s)]
*  We're moving Diddy out of the situation. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3989.92s)]
*  I'm not spending five days with you for $10,000. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3990.92s)]
*  That's a coke binge, by the way, guys. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3992.8s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3994.6s)]
*  I know a coke binge when I hear one. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3995.6s)]
*  I wouldn't do coke, but I would do five days. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=3996.6s)]
*  You just taking me away and we just having a good time. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4000.48s)]

*  Oh wait, you said your freak off days? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4029.48s)]
*  Yeah, not these kind. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4031.48s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4033.48s)]
*  No such thing as there's no levels to freak off. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4035.48s)]
*  If you're going to use that term. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4040.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4041.48s)]
*  Diddy gave freak off a whole new meaning. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4042.48s)]
*  I've never heard it. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4044.48s)]
*  No, I've been here about freak off. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4046.48s)]
*  I'm on freak offs all the time. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4049.48s)]
*  Oh, Baltimore freak off. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4051.48s)]
*  They're probably not like that. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4052.48s)]
*  See now y'all been so y'all ears are conditioned right now. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4054.48s)]
*  They probably got a good seafood menu at those sites. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4057.48s)]
*  There's a lot of fish. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4059.48s)]
*  A lot of fish. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4061.48s)]
*  Yeah, but she also talked about too that, you know, being with Diddy, she was happy. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4062.48s)]
*  She wanted to make him happy. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4067.48s)]
*  So she did a lot of things and she alleges that she had a $20,000 a month allowance while [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4068.48s)]
*  she was his girl. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4072.48s)]
*  So they're going to get that. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4074.48s)]
*  That was the beginning of her testimony. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4075.48s)]
*  Was the internet right about who that person was yesterday? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4077.48s)]
*  I cannot confirm nor deny that. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4079.48s)]
*  I just think it's silly if you know, you let somebody be a Jane though, but everybody in [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4081.48s)]
*  the courtroom can see that person and then they run the social media. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4085.48s)]
*  Like I don't, it's just, it's weird to me. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4088.48s)]
*  What's the point of being Jane though? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4090.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4091.48s)]
*  Put them behind a wall or something so nobody can at least see them or something. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4092.48s)]
*  But then the jury wants to see, I mean, I guess the jury would be different. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4094.48s)]
*  They could see it then because you want to see facial expressions. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4097.48s)]
*  You want to see body language. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4099.48s)]
*  You want to know attorneys want to see that too because you know, the line of questioning [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4100.48s)]
*  and you can tell where people are going or not going and all that. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4104.48s)]
*  It's so much different art to this stuff. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4106.48s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4108.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4109.48s)]

*  I don't care. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4875.96s)]
*  Me neither. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4876.96s)]
*  But that don't have nothing to do with you saying, Happy Pride to this man that you barely [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4877.96s)]
*  even know. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4880.599999999999s)]
*  I think that's disrespectful. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4881.599999999999s)]
*  I've been seeing them do that to call Anthony Towns, too. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4882.599999999999s)]
*  What'd you say, Jeff? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4885.04s)]
*  And then he tried to play it off like, I'm just saying, Happy Pride. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4886.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4889.5199999999995s)]
*  You know good and damn well you don't say Happy Pride to nobody that's not celebrating [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4890.68s)]
*  Pride Month. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4894.240000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4895.240000000001s)]
*  Why? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4896.240000000001s)]
*  That man got a wife, kids, sons, who gon' hear this? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4897.240000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4900.240000000001s)]
*  Man. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4901.240000000001s)]
*  Let's go to the phone lines. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4902.240000000001s)]
*  Hello, who's this? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4904.240000000001s)]
*  This is Nika. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4905.240000000001s)]
*  Hey, what's up, Nika? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4906.240000000001s)]
*  Help me out. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4907.240000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4908.240000000001s)]
*  I was confused a little a couple days ago when you had Ricky Smiley up there and he brought [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4909.240000000001s)]
*  his son. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4913.240000000001s)]
*  Because I always thought he was gay. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4914.240000000001s)]
*  First of all, Ricky Smiley is not gay. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4915.240000000001s)]
*  And that's not his son. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4918.240000000001s)]
*  So you're just wrong all across the board. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4920.96s)]
*  Chris is not his son. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4921.96s)]
*  Oh. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4922.96s)]
*  Why would you think that? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4923.96s)]
*  Because he was talking about his kids, wasn't he? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4924.96s)]
*  No, I'm saying, why would you think Ricky was gay? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4925.96s)]
*  He seemed like one of the old school gays. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4926.96s)]
*  Like he was raised in a religious home so you're not ever going to come out. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4927.96s)]
*  But everybody knows. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4928.96s)]
*  I hate people. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4929.96s)]
*  Man, salute to Ricky Smiley, man. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4930.96s)]
*  Y'all just being ridiculous. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4931.96s)]
*  Good morning. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4932.96s)]
*  Who's this? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4933.96s)]
*  Hi. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4934.96s)]
*  Ashley. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4935.96s)]
*  Yes, Ashley, have you ever mistaken somebody for being gay? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4936.96s)]
*  Because they had a little zest to it. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4938.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4939.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4940.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4941.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4942.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4943.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4944.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4945.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4946.96s)]
*  So you're not mistaken somebody for being gay because they had a little zest to it? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4948.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4951.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4952.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4953.68s)]
*  So there was this guy when I was in high school for freshman year, he used to hang out with [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4954.68s)]
*  all the girls and he never hung out with none of the boys and he always was putting on lip [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4955.68s)]
*  gloss. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4958.68s)]
*  So I went up to him and was like, hey, why some of you don't say that you're gay and [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4959.68s)]
*  stuff and I never think you took 20 boys? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4964.68s)]
*  And he was like, I'm not gay. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4965.68s)]
*  But when we graduated high school, he ended up transitioning. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4966.68s)]
*  So I wasn't wrong. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4967.68s)]
*  I just shouted him out too early. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4968.68s)]
*  Well, no, he transitioned. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4969.68s)]
*  He was like, I'm not gay. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4970.68s)]
*  I'm not gay. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4971.68s)]
*  I'm not gay. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4972.68s)]
*  I'm not gay. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4973.68s)]
*  I'm not gay. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4974.68s)]
*  I'm not gay. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4975.68s)]
*  No, he transitioned to a girl. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4977.400000000001s)]
*  So he was transgender. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4980.88s)]
*  He wasn't gay. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4981.88s)]
*  Yeah, he wasn't gay. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4982.88s)]
*  No, in high school, he was a boy born by his boy name. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4983.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4988.88s)]
*  Putting on lip gloss and saying that he was not gay. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4989.88s)]
*  And I thought that he was out and open. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4991.88s)]
*  But you can transition and still like women. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4994.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4996.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4997.88s)]
*  No, he transitioned and like men. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=4998.88s)]
*  He changed his government name. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5001.88s)]
*  Oh, got you. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5003.88s)]
*  Got you. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5004.88s)]
*  And he's like, he's peaches. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5006.08s)]
*  You know? [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5008.08s)]
*  He's not maroon. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5009.08s)]
*  So maybe he wasn't gay in high school. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5011.08s)]
*  Maybe he figured out what he liked later in life. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5013.08s)]
*  I'm not doing this with y'all on the product. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5016.08s)]
*  No, I'm sorry, y'all. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5018.08s)]
*  If he wasn't gay the way he is now, you would have known. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5019.08s)]
*  He was in the closet with anything. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5022.08s)]
*  All right, so look, you said he with a man now, right? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5024.08s)]
*  Like he with a man, right? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5027.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5028.08s)]
*  He's a female. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5029.08s)]
*  Like the way they... [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5030.08s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5031.08s)]
*  But he's with a man. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5032.08s)]
*  He is a female. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5033.08s)]
*  But he's with a man. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5034.08s)]
*  He is a female, but he's with a man though. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5035.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5037.28s)]
*  Right? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5038.28s)]
*  Yeah, so he wasn't gay. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5039.28s)]
*  Because he just wanted to be a woman. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5040.28s)]
*  Like he wasn't attracted to men as a whole. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5043.28s)]
*  Let's go to the next call. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5047.28s)]
*  That math problem just messed me up. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5049.28s)]
*  I'm not doing this on the product. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5051.28s)]
*  That felt like that new math my kids be bringing home. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5053.28s)]
*  I don't know what the hell. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5055.28s)]
*  Go ask your mama. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5056.28s)]
*  Good morning. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5057.28s)]
*  Good morning, DJ Henry Dyslurge. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5058.28s)]
*  How y'all doing? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5060.28s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5061.28s)]
*  Have you ever mistaken somebody for being gay? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5062.28s)]
*  Just because they were a little zesty? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5064.48s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of did it all the time. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5066.48s)]
*  Especially with my guy friends. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5067.48s)]
*  Sometimes some guys may talk flamboyant, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5069.48s)]
*  but they're not really gay. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5071.48s)]
*  They just talk that way. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5072.48s)]
*  And then it's like you can't really ask [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5073.48s)]
*  because it's a temper. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5075.48s)]
*  So it's kind of like, is he or is he not? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5076.48s)]
*  And if you ask, you can go either way. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5079.48s)]
*  So I usually just keep it in my mind [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5081.48s)]
*  and try to find out another way. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5083.48s)]
*  But it happens often based on how you talk [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5084.48s)]
*  or how you carry yourself. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5087.48s)]
*  I actually don't mind you keeping it to yourself. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5088.48s)]
*  The problem I have is when people like MBB, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5090.48s)]
*  like Happy Pride, the people, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5092.679999999999s)]
*  you don't know what these people's sexuality are? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5094.679999999999s)]
*  Leave these people alone. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5096.679999999999s)]

*  But nobody ever says my partner, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5332.68s)]
*  you say my wife. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5333.68s)]
*  Like, do you say your partner, Jess, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5334.68s)]
*  or you say your husband? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5335.68s)]
*  I say my husband, but look, usually gay guys do say my partner. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5336.68s)]
*  Correct. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5340.68s)]
*  They don't say husband. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5341.68s)]
*  They usually say that. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5342.68s)]
*  When I was at the hospital, I had a nurse and whatever [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5343.68s)]
*  and he kept saying his partner, his partner. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5346.68s)]
*  And that's how I knew he was gay. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5348.68s)]
*  Other than that, I wouldn't have known he was gay. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5350.68s)]
*  He was like, yeah, I'm, and then he was like, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5352.68s)]
*  I'm very spoiled by my partner. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5354.68s)]
*  And I was like, oh, like, yeah, he gay. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5356.68s)]
*  But before that, I couldn't detect the zest. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5358.68s)]
*  Well, what about, you know, if you're in Atlanta [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5360.68s)]
*  and somebody be like, that's my partner. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5362.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5364.68s)]
*  My partner from, you know what I'm saying? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5365.68s)]
*  They ain't gonna say that's my partner. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5367.68s)]
*  My partner. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5369.68s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I've heard. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5370.68s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5371.68s)]
*  They say that in the street. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5372.68s)]
*  That's my partner then. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5373.68s)]
*  Listen, man, the moral of the story is [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5374.68s)]
*  stop doing that to people. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5377.68s)]
*  Don't be assuming that people are anything. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5378.68s)]
*  Okay, mind your damn business. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5380.68s)]
*  All right? [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5382.68s)]
*  If you don't gotta say happy pride [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5383.68s)]
*  just because you feel that way. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5384.68s)]
*  Because you might be outing somebody [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5385.68s)]
*  that don't want to be outed. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5387.68s)]
*  Or you just might be offending somebody [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5388.68s)]
*  because they're not gay. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5390.68s)]
*  Like, why are you calling me? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5391.68s)]
*  Why should we be happy pride? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5392.68s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, all that, all that good stuff. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5441.68s)]
*  What's up, guys? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5443.68s)]
*  I want to start with honorable mentions of songs we're not going to get into, but dropped [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5444.68s)]
*  today. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5448.68s)]
*  Glorilla, Drive Typa, which samples Keisha Cole, Love. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5449.68s)]
*  You want to type it hard. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5452.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5453.68s)]
*  Lil' Sims dropped the album. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5454.68s)]
*  One of my favorite spitters from the UK is Carl Lotus. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5455.68s)]
*  Sexy Red dropped the track, and Ty Dolla Sign also dropped the song called All In that [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5458.68s)]
*  samples a few different rhythms. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5462.68s)]
*  Why you didn't play Lil' Sims? [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5463.68s)]
*  I want to get into Lil' Sims because I saw somebody, I don't know, it's funny you said [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5464.68s)]
*  that because randomly I saw a video yesterday of a bunch of people bigging up Lil' Sims, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5468.68s)]
*  like Lil' Kim, I mean Lil' Kendrick Lamar, Bustin Rhymes. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5472.68s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5475.68s)]
*  Dochi, it was just a bunch of artists bigging her up saying how that's like their new favorite [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5476.68s)]
*  rapper. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5481.68s)]
*  Now, just now, I'm finally glad everybody's catching on. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5482.68s)]
*  I mean the video's old though because Kendrick Hale was even short. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5484.68s)]
*  Oh, okay, okay. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5486.68s)]
*  Nah, Sims really been that girl over there. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5487.68s)]
*  She spits crazy, but the album just came out today so I got to listen to it. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5489.68s)]
*  But honorable mention to drop today, make sure you guys check that out. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5493.68s)]
*  I'm going to start in Atlanta with some R&B. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5496.68s)]
*  It's a new artist named Destiny Brianna and the song is called Special. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5499.68s)]
*  I like that. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5502.68s)]
*  That's real vibe-y. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5503.68s)]
*  It's cool, I like it. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5504.68s)]
*  It's cool, I feel like I've heard it before. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5505.68s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5507.68s)]
*  Keeping it in Atlanta, Swave dropped a new tape called Billy 2 on May 9th and Billy 1 [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5508.68s)]
*  was a R&B tape. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5515.68s)]
*  Billy 2 is a rap tape for all of the fellas personally. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5516.68s)]
*  I love Billy 1, but Billy 2 has been actually going up in Atlanta. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5519.68s)]
*  The song Bishop is doing really well followed by the song Destiny that samples Destiny Childs, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5522.68s)]
*  but the one that Jermaine Dupri reposed it is called Off the Leash, which is a play off [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5528.68s)]
*  of Gucci Mane Off the Leash and is doing really well. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5534.68s)]
*  He's snapping. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5536.68s)]
*  He's snapping. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5537.68s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5538.68s)]
*  It's cool though, you know what I'm saying? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5539.68s)]
*  Off the Leash is such a classic record though. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5541.68s)]
*  It is a classic. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5543.68s)]
*  That's a classic record, so it's like when you've said it I'm listening, so I'm waiting [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5544.68s)]
*  for that energy. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5548.68s)]
*  I get what he was doing, it was an inter, what do you call it, an interpolation. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5549.68s)]
*  Interpolation. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5552.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5553.68s)]
*  But it was cool, it was cool. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5554.68s)]
*  Yes, okay. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5555.68s)]
*  But the whole tape is fire, so definitely check it out. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5556.68s)]
*  And Jermaine Dupri liked it so much that he invited him to the studio, so I'm looking [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5559.68s)]
*  forward to see what they cook up because I've really been enjoying these producer tapes [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5562.68s)]
*  that's been going on. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5567.68s)]
*  Especially when it's the OGs and the Young Gods, I like that. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5568.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5571.68s)]
*  It's a good way to bridge that. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5572.68s)]
*  Because the OGs know how to make records. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5573.68s)]
*  A lot of times the younger artists don't necessarily know how to make records. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5574.68s)]
*  Yeah, well if the OGs want to train some of the younger producers, we're more than willing [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5577.68s)]
*  to learn. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5581.68s)]
*  It's totally different now though. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5582.68s)]
*  Before it was 16 hooks, 16 hooks, 16 hooks. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5583.68s)]
*  Now it's a lot less than that now. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5585.68s)]
*  Some of these songs only be two minutes long, a minute and 40 long, so it's totally different. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5587.68s)]
*  This is true. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5591.68s)]
*  Well, another producer artist tape that's going to be dropping on the 20th is Kenyon [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5592.68s)]
*  Dixon and Terrence Martin. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5596.68s)]
*  It's called See You Later and it features Rhapsody. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5598.68s)]
*  And one of my favorite upcoming singers, OG. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5601.68s)]
*  The song that I want to say today is called See You Later. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5603.68s)]
*  Ooh, so you say you're the best for last, huh? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5606.68s)]
*  That ain't even last. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5608.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5609.68s)]
*  I did though. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5610.68s)]
*  She hit us up for that. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5611.68s)]
*  Now I got to look that up. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5612.68s)]
*  That's her. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5613.68s)]
*  Who is that, you said? [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5614.68s)]
*  That's Kenyon Dixon and Terrence Martin. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5615.68s)]
*  But that's just the singles. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5617.68s)]
*  They got a tape that's coming. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5619.68s)]
*  They have a crazy record on there called Not Like That and another one called Only Real [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5620.68s)]
*  One Survive. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5624.68s)]
*  They sent me the tape early. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5625.68s)]
*  This girl is called See You Later, you said? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5626.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5628.68s)]

*  Okay, good. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5631.68s)]
*  All right. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5632.68s)]
*  We're going to keep it R&B since you guys are feeling it. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5633.68s)]
*  I was going to hit this little Wayne joint because you know he dropped Cardistix, but [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5634.68s)]
*  let's keep it R&B. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5637.68s)]
*  This last one is an R&B artist named Akia. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5638.68s)]
*  She signed to Since the 80s with Zeke and Barry. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5642.68s)]
*  And I'm actually going to be DJing their showcase this weekend, BET Weekend in LA. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5644.68s)]
*  But this song is called Pajamas. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5648.68s)]
*  I love this song. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5650.68s)]
*  She gave it Normani. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5660.68s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard that one too. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5661.68s)]
*  I feel like that same formula that they do with a lot of the girls. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5663.68s)]
*  Fine. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5667.68s)]
*  She ended it with Terrence Martin. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5668.68s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5669.68s)]
*  I ended it with that one because of the segues. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5670.68s)]
*  It goes based off what y'all said. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5674.68s)]
*  Y'all like joint tapes? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5676.68s)]

*  Okay. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5752.68s)]
*  I didn't live that life. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5753.68s)]
*  I'm so happy that I don't want to do it. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5755.68s)]
*  It's going to be fun though. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5758.68s)]
*  You're going to love it. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5759.68s)]
*  I've done BET Awards a couple years, but I was talking about on the podcast. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5760.68s)]
*  This year is different because I'm doing it with the show with you guys. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5763.68s)]
*  And you're in the radio room. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5765.68s)]
*  You've never done in a radio room? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5766.68s)]
*  I've been in a radio room with Talent, but not actually doing it. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5767.68s)]
*  And they got, you know, we got a whole Breakfast Club set up in a radio room and I'm doing [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5770.68s)]
*  something on the pre-show carpet. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5773.68s)]
*  So it's just a different level of doing it this year. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5774.68s)]
*  Dope. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5776.68s)]
*  I'm going to be tired, but I'm definitely going to have a good time. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5777.68s)]
*  Well, the beauty of it is all the artists that you've spoken about may or may not be [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5778.68s)]
*  there. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5782.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5783.68s)]
*  So just, you know, be ready. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5784.68s)]
*  Just stand ten toes down because all you're doing is your job and reporting the news. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5785.68s)]
*  And it's the first time we ever been in a radio room. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5789.68s)]
*  We've never been in a radio room. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5791.68s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5792.68s)]
*  Is it? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5793.68s)]
*  That's what I was told. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5794.68s)]
*  We've never been there. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5795.68s)]
*  You've ever been in a radio room? [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5796.68s)]
*  No. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5797.68s)]
*  Me neither. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5798.68s)]
*  No. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5799.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5800.68s)]
*  All right. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5801.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5802.68s)]
*  So this is the first time the Breakfast Club will be in a radio room. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5803.68s)]
*  Me and all ten toes. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5804.68s)]
*  So you'll be representing us. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5805.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5806.68s)]
*  I'm excited. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5807.68s)]
*  I feel like everybody's going to be really excited to see the Breakfast Club set up. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5808.68s)]
*  Because, you know, they walk through like a cafeteria. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5809.68s)]
*  They're going to be so excited to see that. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5810.68s)]
*  You're wearing your natural hair? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5811.68s)]
*  No, I actually have my hair styled. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5812.68s)]
*  She lands in about a couple hours. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5813.68s)]
*  We have a couple things we're doing. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5814.68s)]
*  Oh, Lord. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5815.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5816.68s)]
*  I will do this for a day, but the bob going to look a little different. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5817.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5818.68s)]
*  All right. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5819.68s)]
*  We'll rep us, all right? [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5820.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5821.68s)]
*  When we come back. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5822.68s)]
*  No, don't. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5823.68s)]
*  Rep us depending on what you're wearing. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5824.68s)]
*  Rep us is crazy. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5825.68s)]
*  I feel like your rep us was a little shady and here you come. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5826.68s)]
*  What's wrong? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5831.68s)]
*  No, you repping us. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5832.68s)]
*  No, Lord, I'm going to do a good job. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5833.68s)]
*  Just be prepared. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5836.68s)]
*  That's all. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5837.68s)]
*  Truth be told, forget the outfits, forget the hair, because they're going to look terrible [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5838.68s)]
*  anyway. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5841.360000000001s)]
*  Focus on what you do best, which is your craft. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5842.360000000001s)]
*  That's the number one thing to think about in that radio room. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5844.4800000000005s)]
*  Because everybody in that radio room is really going to be focused on their craft and they're [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5847.400000000001s)]
*  really going to be on their bus and that. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5851.200000000001s)]
*  I remember being in the radio room one time. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5852.200000000001s)]
*  This is way, way, way back in the day. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5853.88s)]
*  I was working with Wendy Williams at the time. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5855.76s)]
*  Of course, Wendy had done her radio room days, but she sent me to do the radio room. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baWcmnd0u5Y&t=5858.76s)]
