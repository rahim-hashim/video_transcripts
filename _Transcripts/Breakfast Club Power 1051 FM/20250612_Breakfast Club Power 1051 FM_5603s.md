*  So I was like, okay. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=120.56s)]
*  So you know, in high school I was on the swim team. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=121.56s)]
*  I did backstroke. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=124.32000000000001s)]

*  But you know, the reason why I gave up was because in high school. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=128.32s)]
*  You started getting backstrokes in the industry. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=130.32s)]
*  Shut up. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=132.0s)]
*  In high school, you'd have to wear the little tiny pants. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=133.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=135.32s)]
*  And you know, at first when you practice it and you train it, it's not a problem. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=136.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=139.44s)]
*  But then when you look in the stands and you start seeing girls in there and people in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=140.44s)]
*  there, you're like, nah, I'm not doing this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=143.44s)]

*  Happy birthday to... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=208.6s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=209.6s)]

*  Lil Duval. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=211.6s)]
*  Drop on the food box for my guy, Lil Duval. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=212.6s)]
*  So why we not playing Living My Best Life? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=213.6s)]
*  Come on now. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=214.6s)]
*  We'll give you a second to pull it out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=215.6s)]
*  We'll give you a second to pull it out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=216.6s)]
*  Pull up Lil Duval, Living My Best Life. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=217.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=218.6s)]
*  Lil Duval got a few records out right now, by the way. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=219.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=220.6s)]
*  On Tivities. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=221.6s)]
*  Oh, is his ass. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=222.6s)]
*  Duval, let me see. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=223.6s)]
*  I'll be 47. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=224.6s)]
*  He's 40. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=225.6s)]
*  He turned 48 today. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=226.6s)]
*  I feel like he's really young. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=232.6s)]
*  I turned 47 in a few weeks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=233.6s)]
*  Happy birthday, Lil Duval. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=234.6s)]
*  He turned 47. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=235.6s)]
*  Nice. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=236.6s)]
*  He's typing it in right now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=237.6s)]
*  And I want you to know that me training the dogs is getting a lot better. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=239.6s)]
*  They're starting to listen. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=242.32s)]
*  Oh, good. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=243.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're starting to look like you have a lot more sleep. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=244.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=245.32s)]
*  So good. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=246.32s)]
*  They're starting to look, because they're not pooping and peeing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=247.32s)]
*  I don't have to wake up in the morning and clean poop and pee before I leave. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=248.32s)]
*  I just walk them, put them back, and they're getting better. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=250.04s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=252.04s)]
*  I love it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=253.04s)]
*  All right, here we go. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=254.04s)]
*  Happy birthday, my guy, Lil Duval. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=255.04s)]
*  Man, drop on the food box for Lil Duval. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  We going to Duval Day this year, too. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=257.04s)]
*  It's the Breakfast Club. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=258.04s)]
*  Come on, let's go. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=259.04s)]
*  Happy birthday, Lil Duval. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=260.04s)]
*  You know Lil Duval got Duval Day on July 12th, but this year he's doing a whole weekend. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=261.04s)]
*  So he got his Duval Day concert that Friday, July 11th, with DaBaby and Plies and Bossman [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=268.04s)]
*  D-Lo and Skillababy and Jacquees. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=275.36s)]
*  Bunch of different people. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=277.36s)]
*  It's going to be at the Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=278.36s)]
*  So you can go to Ticketmaster and get your tickets for that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=283.36s)]
*  Salute to Duval. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=285.36s)]
*  All right, well let's get into some front page news. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=286.68s)]
*  Now, if it's true and Jay-Z really bet a million dollars that OKC would win in four, he lost [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=289.68s)]
*  his money. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=295.36s)]
*  He lost his money. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=296.36s)]
*  Because last night the Pacers won 116-107. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=297.36s)]
*  They lead the series 2-1. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=300.76s)]
*  I don't think anybody expected that, but it might be the Pacers might take it now. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=301.76s)]
*  This might be the Pacers' year. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=306.76s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=308.36s)]
*  I mean, I saw them winning at least two games. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=309.36s)]
*  I feel like OKC will win the series. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=311.36s)]
*  I don't know, Paz. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=313.36s)]
*  This might be the Pacers' time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=314.36s)]
*  They beat Cleveland. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=316.36s)]
*  Why else deserve a chance? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=317.36s)]
*  It might be in time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=319.36s)]
*  This is the era I hate. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=321.36s)]
*  We do this every day, every time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=322.36s)]
*  Last game he was like, I don't think they'll win another game. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=323.36s)]
*  I didn't, you know what I'm saying? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=326.36s)]
*  But they win and it's like, this might be their year. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=328.36s)]
*  Then when OKC win by 20 next game, they'd be like, I don't know who's going to win the series. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=330.36s)]
*  But this team wasn't supposed to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=335.36s)]
*  They weren't supposed to beat the Knicks. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=338.36s)]
*  Indiana has been probably the best team in the league since February. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=339.36s)]
*  So they've been one of the top three teams in the league. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=342.36s)]
*  It's not a surprise. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=345.36s)]
*  It might be written for them this year. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=346.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=347.36s)]
*  Were they once the underdogs? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=348.36s)]
*  Did they just come out of nowhere? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=349.36s)]
*  I think they were the underdogs in every series. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=351.36s)]
*  They were the underdogs versus Cleveland. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=352.36s)]
*  They were the underdogs versus the Knicks. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=353.36s)]
*  They were the underdogs here. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=355.36s)]
*  People just don't watch Indiana. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=356.36s)]
*  Since about February, they've been like the top three teams. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=357.36s)]
*  But they've been the underdog for all these series. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=360.36s)]
*  But look at Cleveland was injured. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=362.36s)]
*  They had players down in Cleveland. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=364.36s)]
*  Milwaukee Damian Lillard didn't play. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=366.36s)]
*  That's why I said it might be their time. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=369.36s)]
*  That's why I'm saying that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=371.36s)]
*  Ain't nobody hurt on OKC yet. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=372.36s)]
*  No. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=373.36s)]
*  It's a seven game series. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=374.36s)]
*  They lose it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=376.36s)]
*  All right. Well, good morning, Morgan. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=377.36s)]
*  Oh, hey. Good morning, y'all. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=378.36s)]
*  How we feeling on a Thursday? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=380.36s)]
*  Good. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=381.36s)]
*  All right. Good. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=382.36s)]
*  Love to hear that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=383.36s)]
*  Of course, we'll address the developments of what's going on in LA [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=384.36s)]
*  regarding the anti-ice protests. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=387.36s)]
*  But first on front page, let's get into some international news. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=388.36s)]
*  The State Department is ordering all non-essential staff to leave the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=391.36s)]
*  embassy of Iraq as tensions flare up between the U.S. and Iran. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=394.36s)]
*  President Trump confirmed the development last night as he visited [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=398.36s)]
*  the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. to see lay miserable. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=401.36s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=405.36s)]
*  Well, they are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=408.36s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=412.36s)]
*  But they are and we've given notice to move out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=414.36s)]

*  Somebody was shooting behind him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=419.36s)]
*  What was going on in there? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=421.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=422.36s)]
*  What was that noise? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=423.36s)]
*  Staff. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=424.36s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=425.36s)]
*  No, probably preparing for his military parade. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=426.36s)]
*  Staffers are also being told to leave the U.S. embassies in Kuwait and Bahrain. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=428.36s)]
*  The order came early Wednesday after Iran threatened to target U.S. military [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=433.36s)]
*  bases in the U.S. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=437.36s)]
*  The U.S. and Iran have reportedly reached a stalemate in their nuclear negotiations. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=438.36s)]
*  And President Trump has threatened to strike if Iran, if the Iran talks failed. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=443.36s)]
*  Now, Iran's defense minister responded to Trump's threats by saying it will [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=448.36s)]
*  target without hesitation U.S. bases within its reach and other international affairs. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=451.36s)]
*  Trade, to be specific, White House says that President Trump is going to going [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=456.36s)]
*  through the proposed trade deal with China. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=461.36s)]
*  Now, White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, said Trump is happy to work with [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=463.36s)]
*  his trade team and happy with the work the trade team has done and share details on [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=467.36s)]
*  the proposed trade deal with China at yesterday's briefing. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=471.36s)]
*  Let's take a listen to that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=474.36s)]
*  China has agreed to open their markets to the United States separately of this deal. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=475.36s)]
*  And when it comes to this deal, we're going back to the terms that were agreed upon in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=480.36s)]
*  Geneva for the release of some of those critical minerals and the magnets from China to [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=483.36s)]
*  the United States. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=488.36s)]
*  And we have agreed to fully comply with the Geneva agreement as well. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=489.36s)]
*  She went on to say that Trump will have more to say on the subject soon. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=493.36s)]
*  And Elon Musk is walking back his comments, but I won't get too much into that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=497.36s)]
*  We'll talk more about that at seven. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=500.36s)]
*  He said he might have gone too far. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=503.36s)]

*  Being a rep for mental health. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=785.3599999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=788.3599999999999s)]
*  It's men's mental health month, too, by the way. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=790.16s)]
*  Most definitely. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=792.16s)]
*  And I feel like it's a direct shock to those men that are portrayed to be gay. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=793.16s)]
*  Because if you're gay, I feel like that's a mental health issue. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=798.16s)]
*  Do you agree or disagree with that? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=802.16s)]
*  No, I don't think being gay is a mental health issue. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=806.16s)]
*  I think that people look boy. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=808.16s)]
*  Why don't you figure? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=809.16s)]
*  That's as far as the trauma. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=810.16s)]
*  The person don't wake up and be like, oh, I'm attracted to men. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=812.16s)]
*  Something just has to happen in that mental state. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=815.16s)]
*  I don't believe that, but continue. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  No, I'm just saying you really think about it. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=821.9599999999999s)]
*  Really understand where I'm coming from. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=823.9599999999999s)]
*  When I say mental health, mental health is something that you, within you. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=825.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, so now you portraying to be something that you're not, then that is like a what? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=829.9599999999999s)]
*  Don't you call that bipolar or like a multi-personality person? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=834.9599999999999s)]
*  So now you're portraying to be something that you're not. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=839.9599999999999s)]
*  So that's a mental health issue. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=841.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they're portraying to be something that they're not. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=843.9599999999999s)]
*  You wake up and you naturally you can't. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=846.76s)]
*  That's a sexual preference, Charlamagne. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=849.76s)]
*  That's a sexual preference. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=851.76s)]
*  I'm not gay. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=853.76s)]
*  I'm a married man of five. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=854.76s)]
*  I don't know nothing about that. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=855.76s)]
*  But I'm saying I was on TikTok and I had a panel and I was really talking about it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=857.76s)]
*  And a lot of people got offended. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=862.76s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you got to keep it above. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=863.76s)]
*  At the end of the day, these men want to pretend to be men. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=865.76s)]
*  And these men want to pretend to be women. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=869.76s)]
*  That's a mental health situation that we're going to put on our own. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=871.76s)]
*  Now you're confusing things. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=875.56s)]
*  Now you're talking about transgenders right now. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=876.56s)]
*  You ain't talking about... [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=878.56s)]
*  Everything. Everything. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=879.56s)]
*  You're pretending to be the men that have the sassy voices. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=880.56s)]
*  The d***s that be having the swimming. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=884.56s)]
*  That's a mental health issue. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=888.56s)]
*  Let's put it over on Fun Street. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=890.56s)]

*  Please. Please. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=893.56s)]

*  I'm tired of people. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=899.56s)]
*  I'm tired of people judging people that's actually coming up with truth. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=902.3599999999999s)]
*  This is truth, bro. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=905.3599999999999s)]
*  In the Bible, how can you be gay and be Christian? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=907.3599999999999s)]
*  When the Bible claims... [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=909.3599999999999s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=911.3599999999999s)]
*  Put the two of you together, bro. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=912.3599999999999s)]
*  The Bible also says do not judge. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=914.3599999999999s)]
*  And you're doing a lot of judging this morning. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=915.3599999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=916.3599999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=917.3599999999999s)]

*  Yes, sir. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=952.16s)]
*  Don't try to push up now, bro. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=953.16s)]
*  You had no pebbles in the face. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=954.16s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=956.16s)]
*  By the way, I still don't think they're gonna win the series. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=957.9599999999999s)]
*  That's why I said. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  My prediction was I don't know what the numbers are gonna be. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=961.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know if it'll be game six, game seven. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=964.9599999999999s)]
*  But I think OKC gonna win the series. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=966.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, yeah, but nobody has faces the places from game one. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=968.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, round one against the Brooks, against the Cavs, or against the Knicks. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=972.9599999999999s)]
*  Y'all are really confident it was done again. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=976.9599999999999s)]
*  I thought they were done versus Cleveland. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=978.9599999999999s)]
*  I thought they were gonna be done versus the Knicks. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=980.9599999999999s)]
*  And I definitely don't think they were gonna win today. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=982.9599999999999s)]
*  Why'd you say they were done versus Cleveland? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=984.9599999999999s)]
*  They won Cleveland 4-1. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=985.9599999999999s)]
*  Before they even played Cleveland, I didn't think they had a chance. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=986.96s)]
*  Before they played Cleveland, yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=988.96s)]
*  I didn't think they had a shot. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=989.96s)]
*  So like I said, this might be. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=990.96s)]

*  She passed away yesterday after a battle with breast cancer. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1090.92s)]
*  The news was announced by her sister via her sister's Facebook. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1096.16s)]
*  Ananda Lewis, for those who may not know, trailblazing TV host, model, Howard University [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1100.1200000000001s)]

*  She with BET's teen summit in 1995, MTV, TRL and Hot Zone in 97. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1109.3200000000002s)]
*  She also did her own syndicated daytime talk show in 2001, the Ananda Lewis show. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1116.0400000000002s)]
*  And then she worked for a bunch of other outlets including ET. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1121.28s)]
*  She was crowned the hip hop generation's it girl back in 99 by the New York Times. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1124.4s)]
*  And she's been very vocal about her battle with breast cancer. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1129.52s)]
*  So she spoke to ABC just about you know, her legacy and how she wanted to be remembered. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1134.48s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1140.2s)]
*  What is it that you hope people say about you? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1141.2s)]
*  People remember about you? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1144.8400000000001s)]
*  Maybe that I loved hard and lived loud and didn't back away from problems and love this [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1146.1200000000001s)]
*  life and was okay with letting it go too. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1153.92s)]
*  So sad. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1158.72s)]
*  Very sad. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1159.72s)]
*  The most tragic thing about that story is reading how she regretted how she chose to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1160.72s)]
*  handle her initial her initial diagnosis. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1165.7600000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1168.1200000000001s)]
*  She says she didn't get regular mammograms and she wanted to do alternative methods when [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  she got diagnosed. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1172.92s)]
*  And yeah, yeah. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1173.92s)]
*  And we actually have that clip. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1174.92s)]
*  She was that was in the same ABC interview where she talked about her experience with [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1177.2s)]
*  mammograms. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1180.4s)]
*  Let's take a listen to that. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1181.4s)]
*  I wanted to share what was happening to me because I saw places I could have done better. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1182.6399999999999s)]
*  I really do believe that everything is working for my good. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1187.6s)]
*  I know by 47 I should have had my first mammogram. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1190.8s)]
*  And I didn't do that because I saw my mom do it for 30 years and she still ended up [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1193.9599999999998s)]
*  being diagnosed with breast cancer. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1198.52s)]
*  I didn't have the understanding then that I had now. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1200.48s)]
*  So I did the best I could with the information I had at the time. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1203.9199999999998s)]
*  And now that's changed. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1208.8799999999999s)]
*  But that's also one of the reasons I decided to share. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1209.8799999999999s)]
*  I wanted other women who were avoiding mammograms to just bite the bullet and go get it. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1211.6s)]
*  Yes, especially if you've got a history of it in your family. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1215.8s)]
*  Like, yeah, yeah, 100 percent. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1217.96s)]
*  I actually started I started early with like full body scans and mammograms because of [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1220.0s)]
*  the history of my family. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1224.04s)]
*  But I will say for a lot of people, when you see it in real time, like you see it happen [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1225.04s)]
*  to someone else, it does make your way of thinking about treatment or other things very [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1228.8s)]
*  like your own experience. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1233.56s)]
*  And I don't think people understand it until you actually go through it. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1234.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1237.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1238.6799999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation online or maybe it's true information. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1239.6799999999998s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1240.8799999999999s)]
*  But I know when Gia went and she got her mammogram and she posted about it and talked about the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1241.8799999999999s)]
*  experience, there was a lot of people in the comments that were saying, don't get a mammogram. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1245.0s)]
*  Mammogram makes the cancer come faster. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1249.1599999999999s)]
*  And yeah, a lot of people are saying that. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  So people believe that as well. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1252.48s)]
*  But you know, we always say go to the doctor, get checked out. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1253.76s)]
*  No matter what. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1256.9199999999998s)]
*  Rather know what happens and be able to try to figure it out before it's too late. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1261.9199999999998s)]
*  Some of these things are preventable. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1262.9199999999998s)]
*  And I don't care if people call you a hypochondriac. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1263.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't care if people tell you that you bugging. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1265.36s)]
*  Take your ass to the doctor. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1267.04s)]
*  Don't listen to TikTok. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1268.04s)]
*  Yes, 100 percent. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1269.04s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1270.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1271.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1272.04s)]
*  So I do want to mention that the day that Ananda passed away was her son, Langston's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1273.04s)]
*  graduation from middle school. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1278.08s)]
*  So it is, of course, a bittersweet day for their family. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1280.08s)]
*  That is what her sister told TMZ. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1283.68s)]
*  But they also talked about, you know, she was surrounded by her family at her home when [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1285.8799999999999s)]
*  this happened and they've already began planning a memorial for her in the next few weeks. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1290.48s)]
*  And her family says that they have received an outpouring of love, especially from celebrities [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1294.48s)]
*  who she's encountered and encountered in her career, who already are telling her family [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1299.36s)]
*  they want to speak during her memorial about how she influenced their careers and how she [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1304.68s)]
*  handled their interviews with them so well during their careers, which ultimately helped [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1309.6s)]
*  them. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1313.52s)]
*  She's one of those ones who influenced so many but didn't get her just due. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1314.52s)]
*  And I think it's because there was no social media back then. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1317.68s)]
*  So it didn't amplify what it was that she was doing. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1323.72s)]
*  It didn't preserve a lot of those moments for this generation to go back and watch, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1326.56s)]
*  if that makes sense. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1330.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think you got to go down a rabbit hole on YouTube to see Ananda's clips. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1331.52s)]
*  But also to what I, my biggest thing with watching her when I did get to see her, when [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1335.6399999999999s)]
*  people would read clips and stuff like that, her look and just how she carried herself, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1340.96s)]
*  even in her sit down interviews, she had huge interviews, but she was always the same in [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1346.2s)]
*  every single interview. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  She had her own talk show. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1351.8799999999999s)]
*  I remember when they were saying Ananda was going to be the next Oprah. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1353.88s)]
*  I mean, it was daytime syndicated talk show. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1356.68s)]
*  That's a huge slot to have. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1359.5600000000002s)]
*  Before the Wendy's, right there. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1362.0800000000002s)]
*  Right around Wendy's, she still doing it, yeah? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1363.88s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1365.88s)]
*  Wendy was on the radio. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1366.88s)]
*  That was 2001. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1367.88s)]
*  The Ananda Lewis show was 2001. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1368.88s)]
*  They were saying she was going to be the next Oprah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1369.88s)]
*  Well, sending her family love, I know that they need it right now and just wanted to [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1372.88s)]
*  take some time to say rest in peace to her. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1377.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1379.88s)]
*  I remember her. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1380.88s)]
*  A lighter news update. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1381.88s)]
*  Remember we talked about Deion Sanders, Coach Ron? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1383.88s)]
*  So he has posted on his Twitter just thanking everybody for the outpouring of love that [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1386.88s)]
*  he received and wanted to let us know that he's doing well. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1391.88s)]
*  So he said, wow, I am truly blessed by the abundance of well wishes for all the thoughts [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1394.88s)]
*  and prayers. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1399.88s)]
*  Thank you, thank you, thank you. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1400.88s)]
*  I can assure you all everything is okay and will continue to be so. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1401.88s)]
*  God got me like no other. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1404.88s)]
*  I have so much more work to do to glorify God. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1405.88s)]
*  So please believe God got me. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1407.88s)]
*  I'm excited to get back to Colorado to be at home with my staff, team and all associated [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1409.88s)]

*  So don't go anywhere. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1431.88s)]

*  Morning everybody. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1437.88s)]
*  It's DJ NV just hilarious Charlamagne the guy we are the Breakfast Club. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1438.88s)]
*  Let's get back to some front page news. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1443.88s)]
*  Now last night NBA the Pacers beat the OKC 116 107 the Pacers lead the series to one. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1445.88s)]
*  What's up Morgan? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1452.88s)]
*  Hey y'all. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1453.88s)]
*  Hey. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1454.88s)]
*  So as previously mentioned in last hour, Elon Musk is walking back what he said about President [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1455.88s)]
*  Donald Trump saying that he went too far. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1461.88s)]
*  Now this follows the war of words with the president on social media last week, which [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1463.88s)]
*  started with his opposition to Trump's massive spending bill and culminated with him claiming [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1467.88s)]
*  that Trump was mentioned in the Epstein files. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1472.88s)]
*  Musk later deleted the post. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1474.88s)]
*  Now Musk is saying that he has regrets and that he regrets some of the posts he made [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1476.88s)]
*  about Trump and wrote on X this yesterday morning that they went too far. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1481.88s)]
*  What do you guys think about that? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1486.88s)]
*  I still don't believe any of this feud. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1487.88s)]
*  I think it was all wrestling. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1489.88s)]
*  I still believe that, you know, Elon's companies were suffering and you know, they wanted to [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1491.88s)]
*  do something to try to get him in good standing and it still didn't work because I think they [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1495.88s)]
*  said he lost like a hundred and fifty two billion dollars in Tesla stock on the same [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1499.88s)]
*  day that it happened. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1506.88s)]
*  But when you think about all the other things that can come from this, like, you know, they're [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1507.88s)]
*  talking about building a golden dome. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1510.88s)]
*  Who do you think is going to get that contract? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1511.88s)]
*  You know, they're still going to be giving them government contracts for SpaceX. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1513.88s)]
*  I think I just think it was all I really think it was all wrestling. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1516.88s)]
*  I really do. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1519.88s)]
*  I think the only way Elon's going to really save his company is to step down. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1520.88s)]
*  Interesting take. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1523.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1524.88s)]
*  Let's switch gears to L.A. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1525.88s)]
*  The White House says the anti-ice protests in Los Angeles are aimed at American culture [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1526.88s)]
*  and society. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1531.88s)]
*  Press Secretary Caroline Levitt said California is being led by Democrat radicals. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1532.88s)]
*  She accused L.A. Mayor Karen Bass of engaging in a campaign of lies, blaming President Trump [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1536.88s)]
*  and law enforcement officers for the violence and slammed California Governor Gavin Newsom's [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1541.88s)]
*  response to the protests. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1545.88s)]
*  Let's take a listen to press secretary Caroline Levitt. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1546.88s)]
*  These attacks were aimed not just at law enforcement, but at American culture and society. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1549.88s)]
*  It's self rioters burned American flags, chanted death to ice and spray painted anti-American [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1553.88s)]
*  slogans on buildings. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1561.88s)]
*  Democrats like Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass shamefully failed to meet their [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1563.88s)]
*  sworn obligations to their citizens. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1567.88s)]
*  They didn't have the courage to do the right thing and protect law abiding Californians [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1569.88s)]
*  from rioters. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1574.88s)]
*  That's why President Trump deployed the National Guard and mobilized Marines. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1575.88s)]
*  Levitt also warned cities attempting similar types of protests will not be successful. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1579.88s)]
*  She added President Trump will never allow mob rule and he won't allow his mass deportation [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1584.88s)]
*  efforts to be deterred by left-wing radicals. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1588.88s)]
*  You know, the most interesting thing about this Morgan is, you know, if you listen to [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1591.88s)]
*  people who actually live in Los Angeles, like who actually live in L.A., they are saying [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1594.88s)]
*  the White House and media are hyping this situation up. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1599.88s)]
*  They're saying it's an isolated incident and it's nowhere near as bad as the media in [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1602.88s)]
*  White House or Patron. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1606.88s)]
*  Yeah, let's get into that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1607.88s)]
*  In fact, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, she declared a local emergency as anti-ice protests [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1608.88s)]
*  stretch into its sixth day. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1614.88s)]
*  Now, the interesting fact that you mentioned is that the actual area seems to be about [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1616.88s)]
*  a one mile to two mile block radius in terms of the grand scheme of L.A. city and L.A. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1621.88s)]
*  County. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1627.88s)]
*  So Bass issued the 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew on Tuesday for part of downtown L.A., part [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1628.88s)]
*  of downtown L.A. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1633.88s)]
*  The curfew covers a one to two mile square area where the majority of the violence and [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1634.88s)]
*  vandalism has taken place since Friday. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1640.88s)]
*  It's expected to remain in place for at least the next several days. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1642.88s)]
*  Now, Bass spoke about what led her to make the decision to issue a state of emergency [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1645.88s)]
*  and the curfew. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1650.88s)]
*  Let's take a listen to her comments. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1651.88s)]
*  Clearly, after the violence that took place last night, 23 businesses looted and just [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1653.88s)]
*  the extensive widespread nature of the vandalism, we reached a tipping point and declared a [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1658.88s)]
*  state of emergency and called for the curfew. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1664.88s)]
*  Now, California Governor Gavin Newsom, he says the state is increasing state and regional [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1667.88s)]
*  law enforcement to that region. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1671.88s)]
*  Newsom says the effort is to, in his words, clean up Trump's mess amid protests that have [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1673.88s)]
*  turned violent at times. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1678.88s)]
*  Let's take a listen to comments from California Governor Gavin Newsom. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1680.88s)]
*  It is wrong to destroy other people's property and it is wrong to create the conditions that [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1684.88s)]
*  only exacerbate this. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1689.88s)]
*  But Donald Trump, at the end of the day, is the sponsor of these conditions. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1690.88s)]
*  So Newsom says he is working to send over 800 additional officers to Los Angeles to [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1695.88s)]
*  manage and help the situation and restore order. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1700.88s)]
*  So dozens were arrested yesterday. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1704.88s)]
*  LAPD officers issued another dispersal order after declaring unlawful assembly outside [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1706.88s)]
*  the downtown federal buildings. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1711.88s)]
*  You know, like I always say, man, all humans, regardless of what your race is, your sexuality [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1713.88s)]
*  is, your gender, you know, in this country, we just want some money in our pocket and [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1717.88s)]
*  we want to feel safe. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1721.88s)]
*  Sending the National Guard and the Marines in the LA to deal with people protesting ICE [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1722.88s)]
*  raids, that's not making folks feel safe. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1727.88s)]
*  Like if you are going to be putting the military on people who are, you know, assembling and [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1729.88s)]
*  protesting, peacefully protesting, that's not going to make anybody feel safe. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1734.88s)]
*  Even if you're not out there, that shouldn't make you feel safe. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1737.88s)]
*  But wait, there's more. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1740.88s)]
*  Something to note, if ICE plans to deploy, that ICE plans to deploy tactical units to [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1742.88s)]
*  locations across the country ahead of expected protest activity this weekend. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1747.88s)]
*  That's according to a report from Fox News. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1751.88s)]
*  So-called special response teams will be deployed in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1753.88s)]
*  Seattle, and Northern Virginia, and possibly even Washington, D.C. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1759.88s)]
*  Similar teams, of course, were deployed in Los Angeles in recent days amid the anti-ICE [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1764.88s)]
*  demonstrations. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1768.88s)]
*  It's being called No Kings Day. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1769.88s)]
*  It's a protest, are anticipated across the country Saturday to coincide with the Trump [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1771.88s)]
*  administration's military parade marking the president's birthday and also the Army's [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1776.88s)]
*  birthday. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1781.88s)]
*  So keep that in mind if you're in one of those major cities and you plan to venture out. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1782.88s)]
*  And please, ICE agents, just don't forget who you're after. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1786.88s)]
*  Okay? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1789.88s)]
*  You're after illegal immigrants. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1790.88s)]
*  You're after these people coming into America illegally, you know, the ones that y'all told [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1791.88s)]
*  us are committing crimes. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1794.88s)]
*  Like, you know, I don't think nobody is against the deportation of illegal immigrants who [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1795.88s)]
*  are here committing crimes. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1799.88s)]
*  Just go after the criminals. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1800.88s)]
*  Like, don't go after, you know, people who are just trying to make it in this country, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1801.88s)]
*  who are just trying to figure it out. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1805.88s)]
*  Like, you know, I think that's the issue. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1807.88s)]
*  The issue is, you know, people going to, what are the things called? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1809.88s)]
*  The immigration court and getting locked up there. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1812.88s)]
*  Like, people that are actually trying to go through the process and do the right thing [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1815.88s)]
*  and they're getting snatched up and deported. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1819.88s)]

*  We got to get to, you know, I like to bring, when we have icons and legends like you, I [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1899.88s)]
*  like to start from the beginning. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1903.88s)]
*  Now, you're from Atlantic City. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1905.88s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1907.88s)]
*  From Atlantic City. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1908.88s)]
*  And how did you get into music? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1909.88s)]
*  You say, I want to be a producer. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1910.88s)]
*  And then being from Atlantic City, anybody from Atlantic City will tell you, it's very [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1911.88s)]
*  difficult to get out there. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1915.88s)]
*  How did you get out there where people started hearing your beats and you started selling [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1916.88s)]
*  some stuff? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1919.88s)]
*  My mom was a housekeeper. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1920.88s)]
*  So she would go and she would take care of other people's houses and she would hear [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1921.88s)]
*  these little kids playing piano or being taught. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1924.88s)]
*  She was like, I need this guy to teach my son. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1926.88s)]
*  So I'm five years old. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1929.88s)]
*  I didn't want to play the piano. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1930.88s)]
*  To be honest, but my dad had a house rule. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1931.88s)]
*  You got to play piano to live under this roof. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1933.88s)]
*  So all the siblings played. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1936.88s)]
*  We all played. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1937.88s)]
*  I took the lessons and probably when I was about 10, 11, I discovered I wanted to be [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1938.88s)]
*  a producer. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1944.88s)]
*  I heard Michael Jackson's album. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1945.88s)]
*  And then I started kind of, you know, back in the day you read the credits. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1947.88s)]
*  Teddy Rowley was someone that I really admired. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1950.88s)]
*  I saw Teddy Rowley on a lot of credits. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1952.88s)]
*  I'm like, I want to do this. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1954.88s)]
*  I need to do this. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1956.88s)]
*  So back in the day, there was a magazine called Black Beat. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1957.88s)]
*  Yeah, yep. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1960.88s)]
*  And I saw an interview and it said like, it had like all the top producers, Pete Rock, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1961.88s)]
*  you know, everybody. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1966.88s)]
*  And it was like, we use the MPC to make the beats. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1968.88s)]
*  MPC 60 back then, right? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1971.88s)]
*  MPC 60. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1972.88s)]
*  And I was like, I need this. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1973.88s)]
*  I need this. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1974.88s)]
*  Can't afford that. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1975.88s)]
*  My dad borrowed $1,200 off his life insurance. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1976.88s)]
*  Got the MPC for me. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1979.88s)]
*  There we go. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1981.88s)]
*  Random question. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1983.88s)]
*  How was it growing up in Atlantic City? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1984.88s)]
*  Because I love Atlantic City because my daughter does a lot of cheerleading competitions. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1985.88s)]
*  And for some reason, when I go out there, I just get a good peace of mind. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1989.88s)]
*  I got to go out there and write and all types of stuff. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1992.88s)]
*  How was it growing up there as a child? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1994.88s)]
*  It was hard because there was no outlet. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1996.88s)]
*  There was no studios there. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=1999.88s)]
*  There was no outlet for music. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2000.88s)]
*  So I had to get on New Jersey Transit, you know, taking that two and a half hour bus ride pretty much every other day just to try to get put on. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2002.88s)]
*  Wow, two day up? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2009.88s)]
*  But yeah, but let me tell you, I got discovered. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2010.88s)]
*  I got discovered by Teddy Riley at the Impact Convention. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2012.88s)]
*  Where was that at? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2015.88s)]
*  Lang City. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2016.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2017.88s)]
*  Break that down. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2018.88s)]
*  So he heard a demo that I produced. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2019.88s)]
*  He wasn't really into the guy singing the demo, but he was like, yo, this producer is dope. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2021.88s)]
*  So the manager told me, I told my dad, I'm like, Dad, Teddy Riley heard it. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2027.88s)]
*  We need to go see him. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2031.88s)]
*  He's like, where's he at? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2032.88s)]
*  I said, well, the credits say he's in Virginia Beach. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2033.88s)]
*  So we got to go to Virginia Beach. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2036.88s)]
*  My dad was like, that's like a six hour drive. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2038.88s)]
*  Like, whatever, let's go. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2040.88s)]
*  So we hop in the car. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2041.88s)]
*  We hop in the van, the church van, because my dad's a pastor. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2042.88s)]
*  Hop in the church van. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2045.88s)]
*  We go to Virginia Beach. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2046.88s)]
*  Stand in Teddy Riley's. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2048.88s)]
*  We was in his parking lot probably for like half the day. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2049.88s)]
*  Now for people that don't know Teddy Riley's from Harlem, he built this huge studio in Virginia Beach. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2052.88s)]
*  And it was beautiful. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2056.88s)]
*  Everybody worked there from Pharrell to Bobby Brown to Michael Jackson. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2057.88s)]
*  Yep. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2061.88s)]
*  So we go there in the parking lot. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2062.88s)]
*  We just waiting for him to show up. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2063.88s)]
*  And then finally he shows up like six, seven hours later. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2064.88s)]
*  Pull up on him. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2066.88s)]
*  I'm like, I'm the kid that produced. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2067.88s)]
*  I'm like literally 14 years old. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2069.88s)]
*  I'm like, you just heard my beat. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2071.88s)]
*  He was like, that was you? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2073.88s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2074.88s)]
*  He was like, come on, come in the studio. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2075.88s)]
*  Rest is history. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2076.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2077.88s)]
*  And so now I'm getting inducted in Teddy Riley's, the one inducted. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2078.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2082.88s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2083.88s)]
*  Where did the famous Dark Child come from? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2084.88s)]
*  Where did you get that? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2087.88s)]
*  I just, you know, it was really, the name itself came from the style that I felt that I was creating. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2088.88s)]
*  I love dark minor chords. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2093.88s)]
*  I was youthful. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2095.88s)]
*  You know, I'm a young kid, so I kind of took those words and played with it. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2096.88s)]
*  But then I just started saying, I didn't know that I was really one of the first ones, probably, maybe the first one doing a producer job. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2099.88s)]
*  I didn't know it at the time because I was just like, I was just trying to brand myself. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2105.88s)]
*  So I was like, how do you want to know who did the record? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2110.88s)]
*  So I was like, Dark Child. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2112.88s)]
*  I was saying, Dark Child. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2113.88s)]
*  And then what happened was the artist started to say it. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2115.88s)]
*  So like Tony Braxton sang it and then Whitney said it and then Michael said it and then her said it. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2118.88s)]
*  They just started saying it. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2124.88s)]
*  So I was like, I ain't got to say it no more. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2125.88s)]
*  Let them say it. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2127.88s)]
*  I love that. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2128.88s)]
*  Now I got to ask now. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2129.88s)]
*  You just glazed over Michael Jackson. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2130.88s)]
*  Talk about how you started working with Michael Jackson. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2133.88s)]
*  How was that call and how was he in the studio? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2135.88s)]
*  Because you were actually in the studio with him. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2137.88s)]
*  The greatest artist I've ever worked with hands down. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2139.88s)]
*  Like I ain't no 21 years old. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2142.88s)]
*  You talk about 21 year old kid working with Michael Jackson. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2144.88s)]
*  How did they call? [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2146.88s)]
*  How was that? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2147.88s)]
*  How did he reach out? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2148.88s)]
*  Oh, it caught. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2149.88s)]
*  This is real crazy. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2150.88s)]
*  It caught from a dream. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2151.88s)]
*  But it happened from a dream. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2152.88s)]
*  Oh, I was in my mind. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2156.88s)]
*  Did you say that before? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2157.88s)]
*  I was in my mom and dad's house on the couch. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2158.88s)]
*  Took a nap. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2160.88s)]
*  And I had a dream, literally had this dream that I was pulling up to the studio with glass windows. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2161.88s)]
*  And I saw Michael Jackson in a red shirt. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2167.88s)]
*  That red shirt with the black pants in the window. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2170.88s)]
*  I woke up from the dream. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2173.88s)]
*  Told my mother and father the dream I just had. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2174.88s)]
*  The phone rings like 10 minutes later. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2177.88s)]
*  Lady by the name of Carol Bear Sager calls. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2179.88s)]
*  You probably don't even know what that is. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2182.88s)]
*  She wrote, that's what friends are for. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2184.88s)]
*  It's the older lady, whatever she said. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2186.88s)]
*  I had Say My Name Out at the time by Destiny's Child. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2188.88s)]
*  She goes, Ronnie, I love this song you have out. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2190.88s)]
*  I want to know if you would love to come to my house and work this week. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2193.88s)]
*  And I was like, I didn't even know she was. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2196.88s)]
*  She was like, I'm working with Michael Jackson. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2198.88s)]
*  I was like, where? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2200.88s)]
*  She's like, Bel Air. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2202.88s)]
*  I was like, I'm in Jersey, but I'm out. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2203.88s)]
*  I'm going for real. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2205.88s)]
*  I got on the plane and I stayed in a hotel until she called me. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2207.88s)]
*  She called me on Thursday, four days later. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2210.88s)]
*  Was like, can you come to the house today? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2212.88s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I came. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2214.88s)]
*  I kid you not. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2215.88s)]
*  I kid you not. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2216.88s)]
*  I'm pulling up the driveway. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2217.88s)]
*  I look to the left. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2218.88s)]
*  I see Michael Jackson in the window with the red shirt. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2219.88s)]
*  Damn. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2222.88s)]
*  Staring out the window. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2223.88s)]
*  Just like the dream. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2224.88s)]
*  I was like, nobody can tell me God ain't real. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2226.88s)]
*  Have you ever told him that? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2228.88s)]
*  Did you tell him that? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2230.88s)]
*  100%. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2231.88s)]
*  I literally told him. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2232.88s)]
*  I'm like, he believes in stuff like that. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2233.88s)]
*  He's like, that was how it was supposed to happen. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2235.88s)]
*  Is that how you say it? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2238.88s)]
*  That's how it was supposed to happen. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2239.88s)]
*  Mike's voice is actually deeper than that. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2240.88s)]
*  I bet it is. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2242.88s)]
*  I've been hearing that. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2243.88s)]
*  That's how it was supposed to happen. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2244.88s)]
*  He's a little deeper than that, right? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2245.88s)]
*  But it's true. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2247.88s)]
*  I just feel like God just went and showed me exactly how it was going to be so I can [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2248.88s)]
*  have the story to be able to tell him one day how it was supposed to be. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2253.88s)]
*  I want to say Envy is glossed over, not glazed over. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2255.88s)]
*  Even though Michael Jackson deserves all the glazing because he's the greatest of all time, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2259.88s)]
*  it's glossed over. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2263.88s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2264.88s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2265.88s)]
*  Now talk about MJ working with MJ. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2266.88s)]
*  How was that? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2269.88s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2270.88s)]
*  He worked me hard, bro. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2271.88s)]
*  He's different. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2272.88s)]
*  He'd be like, he would call three, four o'clock in the morning and be like, can I hear what [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2273.88s)]
*  you're working on over the phone? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2278.88s)]
*  And I'd be like, I'm actually not working right now. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2279.88s)]
*  I'm actually trying to take a nap because I've been up for 30 hours. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2282.88s)]
*  No, well, can you go to the studio right now and play? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2285.88s)]
*  He's like that. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2287.88s)]
*  I get up and drive to the studio and play him and Mike was so crazy with it that it [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2288.88s)]
*  was crazy. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2293.88s)]
*  I was playing some on the phone. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2294.88s)]
*  He'd be like, can you turn the hi-hats down three dBs and make sure they're panned to [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2295.88s)]
*  the left? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2300.88s)]
*  And I'd be like, really? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2301.88s)]
*  He goes, yes. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2302.88s)]
*  And I would be bugging and the only thing I could think of, right, which is crazy, right? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2303.88s)]
*  Michael Jackson was taught by Barry Gordy. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2309.88s)]
*  Quincy Jones. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2313.88s)]
*  Quincy Jones. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2314.88s)]
*  Teddy Rowland. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2315.88s)]
*  So that school, I'm a part of that school now. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2316.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2321.88s)]
*  But dude was, he was incredible, bro. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2322.88s)]
*  Like, and a great person. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2324.88s)]
*  We used to bet DVDs, we played pool together. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2327.88s)]
*  Bet DVDs? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2331.88s)]
*  Bet DVDs. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2332.88s)]
*  I used to bet him, he beat me because I scratched and we'd go shopping right here in Virgin [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2333.88s)]
*  Music Store in Times Square. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2339.88s)]
*  He would walk in there with you? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2341.88s)]
*  He put the disguise on. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2342.88s)]
*  We went there and I had to buy the DVDs. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2344.88s)]
*  A lot of people don't know this. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2347.88s)]
*  I took Michael to Rucker Park. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2349.88s)]
*  In disguise. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2350.88s)]
*  To watch basketball? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2351.88s)]
*  No one knows this. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2352.88s)]
*  When we did Rock My World, Michael kept saying, we need to go to a club and test it out. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2354.88s)]
*  And I was like, I got one better. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2359.88s)]
*  I said, I'm going to take this spot called Rucker Park. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2362.88s)]
*  And I didn't let him get out the car, but I just wanted him to feel the energy. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2365.88s)]
*  So I went to Rucker Park and I played the record. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2368.88s)]
*  And they was going crazy. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2371.88s)]
*  They didn't know that Mike, the window was cracked the whole time. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2373.88s)]
*  They didn't know Mike was in the car. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2375.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2377.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2378.88s)]
*  We're still kicking in with producer Rodney Jerkins. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2379.88s)]
*  He has his artist, John Keith, with him as well. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2380.88s)]
*  Charlamagne, you talk about Michael Jackson. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2382.88s)]
*  You worked with him. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2384.88s)]
*  You worked with Whitney. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2385.88s)]
*  You worked with Brandy, Beyonce. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2386.88s)]
*  What's something they all had in common in the studio that separated them from everybody else? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2388.88s)]
*  Tenacity. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2392.88s)]
*  You're talking about artists that focused on making albums. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2394.88s)]
*  Which is another art form that we've lost a little bit. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2397.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2400.88s)]
*  It wasn't about just the single. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2401.88s)]
*  It was about how to make a great album. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2403.88s)]
*  I feel like a lot of them sometimes got caught up in trying to compete with themselves. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2405.88s)]
*  Especially Michael. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2409.88s)]
*  Like he was overly trying to compete with himself. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2410.88s)]
*  You would never beat Thriller. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2413.88s)]
*  How could you? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2415.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2416.88s)]
*  But he believed he would. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2417.88s)]
*  If Michael was alive or was doing what he was doing in the streaming world, I believe he could have beat it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2419.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2426.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2427.88s)]
*  I believe he could have beat it. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2428.88s)]
*  But you know what's interesting with an album like Thriller or any artist? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2429.88s)]
*  What are you trying to beat? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2432.88s)]
*  Are you trying to beat yourselves or are you just trying to be better musically? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2434.88s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2437.88s)]
*  I think someone like Michael got obsessed with knowing the numbers that he did was so high that he wasn't competing against anyone else anymore. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2438.88s)]
*  Musically it wasn't a race with Prince anymore. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2447.88s)]
*  He's like, I already beat you. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2450.88s)]
*  Now I'm trying to beat me. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2452.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2454.88s)]
*  And he would say, I think there's a day where I could do a billion sales. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2455.88s)]
*  That lets me know that he's racing for that. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2460.88s)]
*  He's racing for that. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2462.88s)]
*  And he had to because in his mind he was like, how do you stay hungry? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2464.88s)]
*  How do you stay? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2469.88s)]
*  When you're the greatest, how do you get up for the fight? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2470.88s)]
*  A lot of great fighters lose fights because they just can't get up for the fight anymore because they've done that. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2472.88s)]
*  That's why you got to give props to someone like a Floyd Mayweather. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2478.88s)]
*  You got to be like, yo, this dude stay hungry no matter what. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2481.88s)]
*  He was super competitive. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2484.88s)]
*  He was super competitive with me, meaning like he was a great fighter. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2486.88s)]
*  He was super competitive with me, meaning like he would challenge me and tell me like, yo, that producer over there, he's coming for you. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2490.88s)]
*  He would tell me just like, now I'm like, you crazy. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2498.88s)]
*  If you think he got a chance to get on this project, you out of your mind. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2501.88s)]
*  That's how we talked. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2504.88s)]
*  But he liked that. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2505.88s)]
*  Y'all were here to stir about Jay-Z doing the Summer Jam, bringing Michael out. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2506.88s)]
*  Of course. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2509.88s)]
*  Which story? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2510.88s)]
*  I've never heard that. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2511.88s)]
*  That's because of me. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2512.88s)]
*  Yeah, we've heard stories. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2513.88s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2514.88s)]
*  He brought Michael out at Summer Jam. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2515.88s)]
*  That doesn't happen without me introducing him to Michael. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2516.88s)]
*  J-Z, again, J-Z wants to meet Michael Jackson. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2519.88s)]
*  So my man Big Chuck, Big John, all them call me like, yo, can you introduce Jay to Mike? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2523.88s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I didn't even know Jay yet. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2528.88s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I got him. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2530.88s)]
*  Bring him to the studio. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2532.88s)]
*  That was actually the first time I seen Jay kind of in a just a very chill, like, yo, this is Michael Jackson. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2533.88s)]
*  So yeah, like this is Michael Jackson. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2539.88s)]
*  I introduced him to Michael. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2541.88s)]
*  We had a great conversation. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2543.88s)]
*  We were talking. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2544.88s)]
*  Next thing you know, a couple months later, he calls Michael to do Summer Jam. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2545.88s)]
*  Like, does it? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2548.88s)]
*  Even 50 Cent. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2549.88s)]
*  It was just I was introducing him to people that wanted to meet him and that he wanted to meet. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2550.88s)]
*  Mike was a die hard 50s fan at the time. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2555.88s)]
*  Like no other rapper mattered to Michael. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2557.88s)]
*  They're 50. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2559.88s)]
*  50 and Biggie. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2560.88s)]
*  Can you imagine Michael Jackson wiling the What Up Gangsta? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2561.88s)]
*  Damn. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2564.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2565.88s)]
*  Low-key? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2566.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2567.88s)]
*  From what Ronnie Jackson said, yes, I could imagine that. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2568.88s)]
*  I'm interested in, I was going to ask you about this, but I want to ask you about it. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2569.88s)]
*  Now, I'm interested in your visions, right? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2572.88s)]
*  You just told us the vision you had about Michael and I heard you say that. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2574.88s)]
*  I heard the vision you had about Jay-Z. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2577.88s)]
*  Has Michael or Whitney visited you in any of your visions? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2579.88s)]
*  Whitney used to sing at my dad's church in Pleasantville, New Jersey. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2582.88s)]
*  A little church with 50 people in it. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2585.88s)]
*  Call me up one day. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2587.88s)]
*  I think Charlamagne in a dream. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2589.88s)]
*  Charlamagne in a dream, like in one of your visions, yeah. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2590.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2592.88s)]
*  Wow. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2593.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2594.88s)]
*  Michael for sure. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2595.88s)]
*  Michael for sure. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2596.88s)]
*  Anything you want to share? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2597.88s)]
*  Not as much Whitney, but Michael for sure. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2599.88s)]
*  Just lie. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2602.88s)]
*  I'm back in the lab with Michael, creating. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2603.88s)]
*  And the crazy thing is when I've had that dream, which has happened a few times, it was something musically incredible. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2606.88s)]
*  And when I got up, I couldn't remember what I was creating. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2614.88s)]
*  But in the dream, it was like, whoa, it didn't sound like anything from here. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2617.88s)]
*  Now, you was talking about Whitney coming to your dad's church. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2622.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2625.88s)]
*  So me and Whitney bonded when I worked with her, spiritually we bonded. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2626.88s)]
*  And one day she just called me out the blue and she was just like, hey, what you doing, dark child? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2631.88s)]
*  Early Sunday morning. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2636.88s)]
*  I was like, it's like 8 o'clock in the morning. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2638.88s)]
*  What you mean? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2639.88s)]
*  What am I doing? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2640.88s)]
*  She goes, I want to go to church today. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2641.88s)]
*  And I was like, OK. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2642.88s)]
*  And she's like, no, I want to go to your church. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2643.88s)]
*  And I was like, my church is like two and a half hours from Mendham, New Jersey. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2645.88s)]
*  She was like, I'm on my way. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2648.88s)]
*  And she pulled up to church. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2650.88s)]
*  It was like, she pulled up and she sang. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2652.88s)]
*  She whispered in my ear. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2655.88s)]
*  She was like, tell your daddy I want to sing. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2657.88s)]
*  What year was this? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2659.88s)]
*  This is like 1998 or 9. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2660.88s)]
*  And crazy, she sang, killed it. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2663.88s)]
*  But here, three months before she passed away, she called me up. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2666.88s)]
*  I ain't talked to her in like probably five years. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2670.88s)]
*  She called me, I need to see you. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2673.88s)]
*  I said, what's up? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2675.88s)]
*  She goes, we need to pray together. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2676.88s)]
*  She's like, where you at? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2678.88s)]
*  I said, I'm in my studio in Hollywood. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2679.88s)]
*  She goes, I'm on my way. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2681.88s)]
*  She came all the way down from Newport Beach, wherever she was living at the time. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2683.88s)]
*  Literally came in the studio. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2687.88s)]
*  And next thing you know, it turned into like a church service in the studio. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2689.88s)]
*  Just three months before she passed away. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2693.88s)]
*  So we've always had that like some of that type of connection. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2695.88s)]
*  You know, we always hear conspiracy theories like, you know, they're like, oh, Bill Cosby was trying to buy NBC. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2698.88s)]
*  Michael's the only person I believe they really, really tried to railroad like that because of what he did with the publishing in the music industry. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2703.88s)]
*  He talked about it all the time. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2711.88s)]
*  He talked about it all the time. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2712.88s)]
*  One thing I will say is that in the studio, he would always talk about how he he lived in a certain fear. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2714.88s)]
*  And I used to always try to reel him in a direction like, yo, you only supposed to fear God. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2722.88s)]
*  Man can't, shouldn't have you feeling like that. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2727.88s)]
*  No man should have you living in that space. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2730.88s)]
*  But he lived in that space a lot because he felt like he had something that was so valuable, which he did. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2733.88s)]
*  He had something so valuable that people wanted. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2739.88s)]
*  He owned like half of Sony ATVs publishing. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2741.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think what people have have confused. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2744.88s)]
*  I'm glad you said it that way because I think people have confused the narrative. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2746.88s)]
*  People for so long have said Michael owned the Beatles catalog. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2749.88s)]
*  I heard that Michael owned Sony ATV, which is Babyface, Mariah, the Beatles. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2752.88s)]
*  I see. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2760.88s)]
*  Probably some of my catalog was in there. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2761.88s)]
*  It is like yes. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2763.88s)]
*  Yes, like I mean, you've got three giants, right? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2765.88s)]
*  At the time you had three giants. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2768.88s)]
*  Sony was pretty much the biggest out of three at that time. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2769.88s)]
*  And they did a deal with him that, you know, forever he felt that they wanted back. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2772.88s)]
*  You think they threw all those cases at Michael because they wanted it back? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2779.88s)]
*  I think it could have had something to do with it. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2784.88s)]
*  I'm not going to say exactly that, but it could have had something to do with it. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2786.88s)]
*  But I believe none of it because I was around Mike all the time and I knew the kind of person he was. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2789.88s)]
*  So I'm like, he's really trying to kill his character. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2794.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't believe it. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2797.88s)]
*  And he would say it like, he'd be like, they just can't stand that I'm the greatest. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2798.88s)]
*  He would literally say that. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2803.88s)]
*  He would literally say that. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2804.88s)]
*  They just can't stand that I'm the greatest. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2805.88s)]
*  How was his mind framed during that time? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2807.88s)]
*  Did he feel like the culture, especially black people, supported him and loved him? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2809.88s)]
*  Or did he feel like the world was turning against him? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2812.88s)]
*  Now, I would say we started to surround him with that. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2815.88s)]
*  Like if you look, there was a period where I think he didn't feel that. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2819.88s)]
*  And I felt like he was like, I need this. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2823.88s)]
*  Right. So there were certain people that he started to reach out to, to put their arms around him. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2825.88s)]
*  And he started to feel that. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2832.88s)]
*  That's why he would do a summer jam with Jay-Z. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2833.88s)]
*  It was really like he knew like, I need people to have my back in this. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2836.88s)]
*  And then certain people did wrap their arms around him. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2840.88s)]
*  And as things progressed, the one thing I can tell you about Michael that I started to learn was his family was strong. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2843.88s)]
*  His family, like when they got together and wore all that white, they were wearing those white going into court each day. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2850.88s)]
*  You saw that unity in a different type of light. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2855.88s)]
*  You're like, oh, yo, these Jacksons, they're not playing around with this. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2858.88s)]
*  They unified. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2861.88s)]
*  And I think that helped him, even though he was like probably going through a mentally weak and all of that. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2862.88s)]
*  And it's tough when you know you pretty much own something that everybody owns. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2867.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2874.88s)]
*  Damn. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2875.88s)]
*  Man, so after all that, John Keith, what you got going on? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2876.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2879.88s)]
*  I ain't even ready to get to you yet. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2881.88s)]
*  I'm going to get to you. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2884.88s)]
*  But you know, you got to sit here and listen. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2889.88s)]
*  We ain't never interviewed. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2891.88s)]
*  I prefer that. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2892.88s)]
*  I don't want to go after Michael. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2894.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2896.88s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Rodney Jerkins and his artist, John Keith. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2897.88s)]
*  Charlamagne. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2900.88s)]
*  Did you see Beyonce becoming the Beyonce? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2901.88s)]
*  We now know. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2904.88s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2905.88s)]
*  From the first session. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2906.88s)]
*  Say My Name was our first session. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2907.88s)]
*  And then, you know, we worked together again. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2909.88s)]
*  And I got to deja vu with her and Jay. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2911.88s)]
*  That's when I really knew. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2913.88s)]
*  I saw the difference, right? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2914.88s)]
*  Because in the group format, she still was in the group. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2916.88s)]
*  If you really look at Destiny Shout as a group, they never really showed her as the leader. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2919.88s)]
*  You know how you're in certain groups and you know, like, that's the leader? [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2925.88s)]
*  No, they was kind of trying to position them somewhat like a boys and men where they all could do their thing. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2928.88s)]
*  But we saw the leadership qualities when we worked with her, right? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2933.88s)]
*  But when I got to deja vu, bro, I remember playing her to demo the deja vu for the first time. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2936.88s)]
*  When the song went off, she was already telling me her visual for the visuals. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2942.88s)]
*  So she was like, this is how I see it. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2947.88s)]
*  I'm going to put Jay on it. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2949.88s)]
*  She was telling me, she reminded me of so much of Michael was scary. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2950.88s)]
*  Like at that time, I was like, yo, she just came into her own mic. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2954.88s)]
*  Like she's now, you know, I could just see the elevation of that. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2958.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like really quickly. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2962.88s)]
*  Besides Whitney and Michael Jackson, who was one of your best artists to work with? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2963.88s)]
*  Like the timing, the fact that they're there all the time, they're going to grind it out. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2968.88s)]
*  They're amazing vocalists. Who was that next person? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2972.88s)]
*  Of course, besides Beyonce. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2975.88s)]
*  Probably Brandi. I would think. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2977.88s)]
*  And that's my girl. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2979.88s)]
*  Yeah, like. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2980.88s)]
*  Take us into a session with Brandi. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2981.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2982.88s)]
*  Well, Brandi, it was the regiment that she had that was interesting, right? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2983.88s)]
*  Especially when I was doing Never Say Never, but Full Moon especially. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2987.88s)]
*  Like she was playing tennis with Serena Williams before the session every day. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2991.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2996.88s)]
*  Which was interesting. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2997.88s)]
*  That's great. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2998.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=2999.88s)]
*  She was practicing with Serena every day and she would come in the studio. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3000.88s)]
*  Shout out to my man, Paris Davis, because he was the A&R, like a real A&R cat. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3004.88s)]
*  Right. And he had her. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3009.88s)]
*  He was the one that said you need to be playing tennis. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3010.88s)]
*  So he had her playing tennis early in the morning, come in the studio. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3012.88s)]
*  John can tell you as an artist nowadays, artists can do a song in one day. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3017.88s)]
*  They done it in and out. A few hours, it's done. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3021.88s)]
*  We was doing songs. It was taking us three, four days. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3023.88s)]
*  We really working on backgrounds just on one day. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3027.88s)]
*  I remember times when people, a lot of artists would actually be like, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3030.88s)]
*  yo, Rodney, please let me go. I'm tired. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3033.88s)]
*  I'm like, we ain't done. Like, it's not right yet. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3035.88s)]
*  Until we get this thing right, we're not done. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3038.88s)]
*  Brandi was one of those artists that would go the full length and not complain about it. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3040.88s)]
*  Mike would even sometimes complain like, Rodney, I'm getting hoarse. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3046.88s)]
*  His vocal coach would call me, Seth Rives would call me, like, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3049.88s)]
*  you're working too hard, Rodney, you're working too hard. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3051.88s)]
*  I'm like, yo, we're working on the song, bro. Like, it's what we do. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3053.88s)]
*  How does that affect you now with these new artists, right? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3057.88s)]
*  Because they're not staying in the studio that long, hour or two. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3059.88s)]
*  So how do you still have that same conversation with a new artist and say, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3063.88s)]
*  nah, I need you to come back. I need you to stay longer. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3066.88s)]
*  It's not happening. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3068.88s)]
*  And then, like you said, you'll be like, you used to be like, look, we're not done. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3070.88s)]
*  And your artists stay there because they know the work and dedication is going to make for great music. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3074.88s)]
*  You tell one of these new artists that... [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3079.88s)]
*  They don't even know what eight to 10 hour, 12 hour... [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3081.88s)]
*  It was times, you know, me personally, I stayed in the studio. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3084.88s)]
*  People know, like, I wouldn't leave. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3086.88s)]
*  I'd be there two, three days straight. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3088.88s)]
*  People like after three, four hours, they kind of like, yo, it's time to go. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3090.88s)]
*  So the music is worse. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3094.88s)]
*  I don't know when that shift happened exactly. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3095.88s)]
*  I think like maybe hip hop caused it. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3098.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3101.88s)]
*  Or maybe when we hear stories of like when Lil Wayne says, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3102.88s)]
*  I'm working on this album from the hotel, it may have created a narrative like, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3106.88s)]
*  yo, I don't need to go in the studio in the booth anymore. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3110.88s)]
*  I could just do like he did a record right out of his car that's fire. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3113.88s)]
*  Like they, you know, maybe that's what happened. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3116.88s)]
*  Like something had to shift. Technology. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3118.88s)]
*  So if a young producer came to you right now and they were like, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3121.88s)]
*  how do I create my own brand? How do I create my own Beyonce? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3123.88s)]
*  In this era, is there a blueprint for that? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3126.88s)]
*  Didn't Jay-Z say like if you made a hole, make another hole, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3129.88s)]
*  there ain't no blueprint. Right? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3133.88s)]
*  You just got to work hard and put the effort. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3136.88s)]
*  If that's something that you really want to try to do, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3139.88s)]
*  I just think again, it goes back to you got to study the craft. Right? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3142.88s)]
*  And go hard and see what you can come up with and be patient. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3146.88s)]
*  Because I think the thing is everybody wants the quick thing right now. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3150.88s)]
*  Tomorrow, we got to beat this tomorrow. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3154.88s)]
*  Now, like some stuff takes two, three, four years. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3156.88s)]
*  You got to be patient. You know? [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3159.88s)]
*  Did you feel disrespected when you heard [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3162.88s)]
*  Jess Hilarious's rendition of The Boy Is Mine? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3164.88s)]
*  No. I am not. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3167.88s)]
*  Jess and Lauren. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3169.88s)]
*  When they did the rendition of The Job Is Mine. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3170.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3172.88s)]
*  I thought it was hilarious. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3174.88s)]
*  But I thought it was hilarious. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3176.88s)]
*  We need a little more auditor. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3178.88s)]
*  Auditor was set wrong. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3180.88s)]
*  Next time I'll call the producer. I'll get you straight. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3183.88s)]
*  I'll get you straight next time. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3186.88s)]
*  What was the one record that you were surprised took off the way that it was? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3188.88s)]
*  It might have been that one. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3192.88s)]
*  The Boy Is Mine. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3194.88s)]
*  Yeah, because we were going through this battle when we did. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3195.88s)]
*  When I was doing the Never Say Never project, you understand, I was a kid, bro. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3197.88s)]
*  So there was some people that didn't believe that I should do the whole album. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3201.88s)]
*  Executive produced the whole album. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3205.88s)]
*  I'm in there and I'm like, and I'm young, but I'm super confident. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3207.88s)]
*  Y'all are tripping like this is fire. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3211.88s)]
*  And they were telling me, this is crazy. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3213.88s)]
*  They were telling me at the end of the project, they were like, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3215.88s)]
*  so yeah, we got to go fly down to Atlanta to work with JD to get a single. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3217.88s)]
*  We got to go, then we're going to do Wyclef to get a single. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3221.88s)]
*  And I was like, in the studio, you kind of feel disrespected, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3223.88s)]
*  especially when you've done like nine songs. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3226.88s)]
*  You're trying to tell me we just did nine songs and you tell me I don't got the first single? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3228.88s)]
*  And this is my body of work that I'm putting my in there. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3233.88s)]
*  I don't got the first single? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3236.88s)]
*  I swear on everything I love, I packed my bags up. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3238.88s)]
*  And went home from LA. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3240.88s)]
*  I went back to Jersey and I said, y'all figure it out. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3242.88s)]
*  Damn. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3245.88s)]
*  And then they called back and was like, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3246.88s)]
*  I was like, y'all are tripping. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3249.88s)]
*  We got singles left and right. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3250.88s)]
*  Just put them things out. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3251.88s)]
*  What had you, what nine you recorded already? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3253.88s)]
*  What was some of the ones you recorded already? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3255.88s)]
*  Top of the World with Mace. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3257.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3258.88s)]
*  The Boyz Mind, which was early, early on in the project. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3259.88s)]
*  I mean, we had Angel in the Sky. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3262.88s)]
*  We had did pretty much everything. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3264.88s)]
*  How did The Boyz Mind? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3266.88s)]
*  Was that your idea? And how did that come about? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3267.88s)]
*  How did you get them both together? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3268.88s)]
*  The Boyz Mind is funny. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3269.88s)]
*  I was just again at my dad's house and I was like playing this harp sound. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3270.88s)]
*  And I was like, nobody use a harp sound in urban music. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3275.88s)]
*  When they used it, they used it one way. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3279.88s)]
*  Chuckie Thompson and different producers like Dave Hall back in the day. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3281.88s)]
*  And the Untouchables. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3285.88s)]
*  They used the harp sound like it's called gliss. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3286.88s)]
*  Like it would come down like a gliss. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3289.88s)]
*  I heard it and I liked the sound of it. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3291.88s)]
*  I was like, what if I made like rhythmic? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3293.88s)]
*  And I broke it up, like broke it into rhythm. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3295.88s)]
*  So I just started doing it and my dad came down with a little tape recorder. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3297.88s)]
*  He's always had a little tape recorder. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3300.88s)]
*  He'd be like, that's incredible. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3301.88s)]
*  You got to lay that. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3303.88s)]
*  And then I laid it down. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3304.88s)]
*  And Paris Davis, Brandy's A&R. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3305.88s)]
*  He heard and we did it on, we recorded on Brandy. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3308.88s)]
*  And he was like, yo, what if we put Monique on this? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3311.88s)]
*  And you know, at that time, Monique and Brandy, they kind of didn't like each other. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3313.88s)]
*  It was definitely a feud between the two. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3317.88s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that's never going to happen. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3320.88s)]
*  Knowing Brandy and knowing how that's never going to happen. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3323.88s)]
*  He's like, no, I think it can happen. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3326.88s)]
*  Like if I get you on the phone with Dallas Austin and I was like, all right. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3327.88s)]
*  And then next thing you know, it started to shake. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3332.88s)]
*  And even when it came out, here's the thing. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3335.88s)]
*  I wasn't surprised that it was going to do well. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3338.88s)]
*  I didn't know it was going to stay number one for that long. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3341.88s)]
*  It's like 13, 14 weeks, number one. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3343.88s)]
*  Like we did 16 million albums sold on that project. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3345.88s)]
*  So like those type of things for my first, my second album was, I did Genie Tom. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3349.88s)]
*  My second album that I produced, executive producer to do those numbers was kind of crazy. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3355.88s)]
*  You know, it's crazy back then, right? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3359.88s)]
*  Like nowadays people manufacture the drama, then try to do the music. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3360.88s)]
*  With that record, it was the song, the music. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3364.88s)]
*  And then people started speculating about the drama after the fact. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3366.88s)]
*  Like is there really a boy that they arguing over? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3369.88s)]
*  We know that they got beef with each other. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3371.88s)]
*  So that's, and plus the video. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3372.88s)]
*  I mean, you think about them doing a tour, right? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3374.88s)]
*  They're about to do a tour together. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3376.88s)]
*  You talking about, like why did they do a tour together 15 years ago, right? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3378.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3383.88s)]
*  Like, but you know, it's time of everything. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3384.88s)]
*  I get it. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3386.88s)]
*  But like, dang, like, man, imagine them doing the tour together 15 years. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3387.88s)]
*  That would have been crazy. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3390.88s)]
*  It would have been like baddies, before baddies. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3391.88s)]
*  But this going to be crazy though. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3393.88s)]
*  They didn't get along. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3394.88s)]
*  We're still kicking in with producer Rodney Jerkins. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3395.88s)]
*  He has his artist, John Keith, with him as well. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3397.88s)]
*  Charlamagne? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3399.88s)]
*  Was there ever an artist you worked with who completely surprised you in the booth? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3400.88s)]
*  Like somebody whose talent just hit different when they got on the mic? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3403.88s)]
*  I think, I think, I think SZA is underestimated. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3406.88s)]
*  Like, like, I think sometimes like artists will vocalize based on what's hot or what's going on. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3410.88s)]
*  When there's so much more there, they just not giving it because they don't have to. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3417.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3423.88s)]
*  I think there's a lot more there. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3424.88s)]
*  Like a lot of times, a lot of times when I work with SZA, a lot of times I actually would get some brandy out of it. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3426.88s)]
*  I'd be like, it's kind of, it's kind of getting me like, man, look like some of the stuff she done, like some brandy might have done. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3432.88s)]
*  But then, like her runs. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3438.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's just certain little things. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3439.88s)]
*  Just little nuances that I'm like, oh, that's something. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3441.88s)]
*  But I don't know that she fully even yet knows that she can even go somewhere else. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3443.88s)]
*  I feel like she's one of those people that the more she does the work personally, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3449.88s)]
*  like to improve her mental and emotional well-being, it's going to translate to the music. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3456.88s)]
*  And the question is like, well, at least for me, this is what I believe. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3462.88s)]
*  I just believe that don't happen unless you find God. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3465.88s)]
*  And I'm not saying she don't know God or had an experience with God. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3468.88s)]
*  So don't get that part twisted. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3472.88s)]
*  But I believe like in order for us to mentally be at our best state is when we know God. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3474.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3481.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3482.88s)]
*  Because the Bible says that he's not the author of confusion. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3483.88s)]
*  So you got to have a sober mind. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3487.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3491.88s)]
*  Your mind got to be on point. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3492.88s)]
*  And that only comes from an understanding of real understanding, a real relationship. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3493.88s)]
*  I think people have twisted the narrative too much of religious. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3497.88s)]
*  That's religion. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3501.88s)]
*  What? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3502.88s)]
*  I ain't got nothing to do with nothing. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3503.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's relationship. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3504.88s)]
*  Like, what's your relationship? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3505.88s)]
*  Like, I have a great relationship with my four kids. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3506.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3510.88s)]
*  I have boys, two girls. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3511.88s)]
*  I have a great relationship. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3512.88s)]
*  I'm their father. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3514.88s)]
*  I have a father, a heavenly father. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3515.88s)]
*  I have a great relationship with. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3518.88s)]
*  It ain't religious. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3520.88s)]
*  It's just like, I know how to talk to him and I hear him speak to me. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3521.88s)]
*  It's simple as that. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3526.88s)]
*  So I feel like when you have that relationship, it creates clear path for the things that you [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3527.88s)]
*  create and the things that you want to do. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3533.88s)]
*  Can you work with an artist if you don't see God in it? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3535.88s)]
*  Right now it's different for me. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3539.88s)]
*  There was a time where like I would be straddling that fence over and over again because I didn't [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3542.88s)]
*  look at it for what it was. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3549.88s)]
*  And I think over the last two years, there's been a new birth that happened. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3551.88s)]
*  Like, I get it now. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3558.88s)]
*  I get it now when Jesus told Nicodemus, he said, you got to be born again. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3560.88s)]
*  I get it now. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3565.88s)]
*  Like, and even Nicodemus like, what? [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3567.88s)]
*  Born again? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3569.88s)]
*  What you mean by that? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3570.88s)]
*  What you mean? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3571.88s)]
*  Like, I thought the womb born? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3572.88s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3573.88s)]
*  No, like born again in your spirit. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3574.88s)]
*  You have to be born again. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3576.88s)]
*  And so there's a lot of times people will call me all the time. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3577.88s)]
*  I just got a call to get in the studio with an artist and I was like, I can't do that. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3581.88s)]
*  I can't do the why. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3588.88s)]
*  It's just, it's not where I'm at. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3589.88s)]
*  Now, what I can do and what I will continue to do is speak what I believe is true. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3592.88s)]
*  So I had an artist one time, I had someone call me recently about an artist coming to my studio. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3598.88s)]
*  And I said, when they leave, I mean, if I do a record with them, it might not be the record they expect to do. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3604.88s)]
*  They're like, what? [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3610.88s)]
*  I was like, yeah, I guess real over here. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3611.88s)]
*  And I said, they said, well, how real is that? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3614.88s)]
*  I said, well, every two weeks we do a thing called Worship Alive at my studio where we have kind of church in the studio. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3616.88s)]
*  And I'll use you experienced it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3621.88s)]
*  They're like, you do that? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3623.88s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I guess really real. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3624.88s)]
*  Like I want to, I want to see people changed and you can't see people change unless you change. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3626.88s)]
*  And I'm a work in progress. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3632.88s)]
*  I'm a work in progress. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3634.88s)]
*  You all are. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3635.88s)]
*  You all are. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3636.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3637.88s)]
*  We all work in progress. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3638.88s)]
*  We send daily. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3639.88s)]
*  So, you know, so, but I do, I believe that there's, I believe that there's hope for people. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3640.88s)]
*  I believe I want to see, I want to see people's relationships for them with their father, with their creator. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3644.88s)]
*  So are you a, I guess, a faith artist? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3650.88s)]
*  Because I know you, the aliens alive is a faith label. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3653.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3656.88s)]
*  So I'm a Christian artist. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3657.88s)]
*  I mean, I was raised in a church. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3658.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3659.88s)]
*  My father is, he's a pastor now. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3660.88s)]
*  But, you know, that's kind of new. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3663.88s)]
*  But he's, he's always been in some kind of leadership in the church. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3665.88s)]
*  But even like, you know, for me, like I only, I got, I got no hobbies. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3668.88s)]
*  I do music and I'm a, like I'm a Bible nerd. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3673.88s)]
*  That's it. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3675.88s)]
*  I don't, I don't, I don't do sports. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3676.88s)]
*  I don't do, I don't do video games. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3678.88s)]
*  Like that's it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3680.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3681.88s)]
*  So yeah, proudly, proudly a Christian artist. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3682.88s)]
*  What did you see in John that said, I want to work with him? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3685.88s)]
*  I think he wanted to kill himself. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3689.88s)]
*  When you get to a vulnerable state in your music, sometimes people, it goes over people's heads. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3692.88s)]
*  When I heard some of the things that he was saying, I was like, whoa, like he's special. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3698.88s)]
*  Like this, this, this dude right here is special, special. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3704.88s)]
*  He just needs the right team with him. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3708.88s)]
*  And, and he keeps getting better. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3711.88s)]
*  He's not just a, he's not just a rapper or singer. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3714.88s)]
*  Like he does all his music, produces everything. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3717.88s)]
*  Oh, no, like he's a beast. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3720.88s)]
*  But I, but I knew, I heard his heart in his music. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3721.88s)]
*  And I heard something that could, that was, that could penetrate the youth differently. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3725.88s)]
*  My man, John Keith, June 27, got his project coming out and I'm super excited about his project. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3730.88s)]
*  We're going to get a song on too this morning. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3735.88s)]
*  I listen to a lot of faith based artists. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3737.88s)]
*  You know Miles Minnick? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3738.88s)]
*  Yeah, they got a real wild nigga. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3739.88s)]
*  What? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3741.88s)]
*  He asked me to talk to my guy DJ Head. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3742.88s)]
*  He put me on to Miles a while ago. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3743.88s)]
*  And he ain't even, and the funny thing, he didn't even tell me that Miles was a faith based artist. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3745.88s)]
*  He just said, yo, listen to this. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3748.88s)]
*  Yeah, Head is a big advocate of just, you know what I'm saying? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3750.88s)]
*  Putting it in front, cause you know, people got a, there's a stigma about Christian artists. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3753.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3757.88s)]
*  That they're a certain way that they, they got to sound a certain way. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3758.88s)]
*  And so like when, when you, you hear people that sound like Miles or sound like me or sound like Indy Tribe or No Big Deal, whatever, you know what I'm saying? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3760.88s)]
*  Like, they're like, oh wait, hold up, this is Christian? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3767.88s)]
*  And it's like, it's hard, bro. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3771.88s)]
*  Every single time I hear from Miles, I'm like, dang, I didn't know it was like that. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3773.88s)]
*  Cause the thing is, it's like, those of us who do it well are not on a mission to make a genre of Christian music. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3776.88s)]
*  We're just making music and we're Christians. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3786.88s)]
*  So we're not going to rap or sing about stuff that's not our life. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3789.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3793.88s)]
*  So like, but that's also why, like, you know, what he, what he said, like in my music, I'm always, I'm gonna tell you like, yeah, I was struggling with, you know, the thoughts to take my life since I was 11 years old. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3794.88s)]
*  I'm gonna talk about that. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3805.88s)]
*  And it's not going to be the happy rainbows and sunshine, yo, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3806.88s)]
*  When you get life with Jesus, everything is just good. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3811.88s)]
*  And it's like, no, like, let's talk about real life because people live real life and, you know, they don't, they don't understand what, what, what life with Jesus is like. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3815.88s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3824.88s)]
*  So it's like, we, we've, we fall in love. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3825.88s)]
*  We, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3827.88s)]
*  We get angry. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3828.88s)]
*  We, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3829.88s)]
*  Like there's, there's all kinds of stuff that goes on. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3830.88s)]
*  It's like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3832.88s)]
*  If you making music that is Christian music and it's only worship, then it's like, well, if I'm, you know what I'm saying? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3833.88s)]
*  If I, if I want to listen to love songs, then I got to go listen to the wildness that's out there right now. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3841.88s)]
*  You're saying debauchery or whatever, because ain't no love songs that like can still be about, you know what I'm saying? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3847.88s)]
*  A person loving another person. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3854.88s)]
*  But from a point of view, someone who, who understands that these things are echoes of God, you know? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3856.88s)]
*  And so, yeah, you know what I'm saying? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3862.88s)]
*  That's me. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3864.88s)]
*  But yeah, me and Miles just, just did something and then, yeah. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3865.88s)]

*  Good morning. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3917.88s)]
*  Ladies, this is a miracle. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3918.88s)]
*  There is no question that there are problems in this country between police and community. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3922.88s)]
*  Yes, you are a donkey. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3928.88s)]
*  To the latest on that police killing of a black man. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3931.88s)]
*  Now to new developments in the deadly spa shooting rampage. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3933.88s)]
*  Man, yesterday was a really bad day for him and this is what he did. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3936.88s)]
*  And so we are in a state of emergency. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3938.88s)]
*  Okay, white supremacist violence is and always has been the number one threat to our society. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3942.88s)]
*  But I'm also very proud that my wife is white. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3947.88s)]
*  It's the Breakfast Club, bitches. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3951.88s)]
*  Breakfast Club, bitches. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3952.88s)]
*  All right, Sean, please tell me why was I your donkey of the day? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3953.88s)]
*  Donkey of the day for Thursday, June 12th, little Duvall's born day. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3957.88s)]
*  Drop on the clues for little Duvall. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3960.88s)]
*  Yes, we are not living our best lives right now. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3962.88s)]
*  Okay, because donkey of the day is going to the director of national intelligence, Toci Gabbard. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3966.88s)]
*  Or maybe donkey of the day should go to corporate media or maybe donkey of the day should go to We the People. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3970.88s)]
*  For being so preoccupied with things that have zero impact on our lives. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3975.88s)]
*  That we don't pay attention to all the grave dangers that are right under our noses. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3980.88s)]
*  Okay, if ignorance is bliss, I don't know why everybody isn't more happy because I strive to be optimistic. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3985.88s)]
*  I grew up on the sounds of blackness, baby, as long as you keep your head to the sky. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3990.88s)]
*  But we also got to be realistic about the things that are going on in the world. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3994.88s)]
*  And yesterday, while you were busy watching AI videos of gorillas hosting podcasts talking about fighting 100 men, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=3998.88s)]
*  the director of national intelligence, Toci Gabbard, was releasing a video warning us of nuclear annihilation. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4004.88s)]
*  I'm not making any of this up. Let's listen. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4012.88s)]
*  As we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4014.88s)]
*  political elite and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4020.88s)]
*  So it's up to us, the people, to speak up and demand an end to this madness. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4027.88s)]
*  What? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4034.88s)]
*  We must reject this path to nuclear war and work toward a world where no one has to live in fear of a nuclear holocaust. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4035.88s)]
*  Huh? Am I the only person that finds this unusual? [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4044.88s)]
*  Am I the only person who saw this video and first had to determine if it was AI or not? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4048.88s)]
*  But then once I realized it wasn't, it's real. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4052.88s)]
*  It came from her Twitter account and all the so-called reputable news sources, the ABC News and MSNBC, Bloomberg, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4054.88s)]
*  political NBC News, everybody was posting about it. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4061.88s)]
*  But after I watched it, I was left sitting there scratching my head wondering, why was that just released on Twitter? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4064.88s)]
*  Toci, you can't just post that like it's a regular reel and walk away. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4070.88s)]
*  This is how my algorithm is set up, OK? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4075.88s)]
*  I got a video of a black man sitting in the car with the caption, in the 90s. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4077.88s)]
*  They had us thinking Lil' Kim was the biggest freaking bad boy the whole time it was Diddy, right? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4081.88s)]
*  Then another video of Kai Sinat trying to help Druski holla at Kiki Palmer. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4085.88s)]
*  Then a post from Tyler Perry saying he made more black millionaires than any other studio in Hollywood from the BET Awards. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4089.88s)]
*  Then a video of Pastor Torrey Roberts working out in the gym. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4094.88s)]
*  Then a video of Lauren LaRosa walking around in just stockings and a Steve Harvey blazer. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4097.88s)]
*  Then BOOM! Toci telling us we all going down. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4101.88s)]
*  I understand social media is the new way to communicate, but dear government officials, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4104.88s)]
*  some messages got to be packaged a different way. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4108.88s)]
*  You can't drop this on the timeline and just walk off, Toci. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4111.88s)]
*  OK, you are the director of national intelligence. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4114.88s)]
*  You know things that we don't know. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4117.88s)]
*  We have watched all these billionaires from Mark Zuckerberg to Bill Gates to Larry Ellison. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4119.88s)]
*  All build these underground bunkers. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4124.88s)]
*  OK, I've been reading about them for years, building these luxurious underground bunkers. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4126.88s)]
*  And they're doing it as a form of apocalyptic insurance. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4131.88s)]
*  And here you got Toci. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4135.88s)]
*  Put a 3 minute and 31 second video on Twitter. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4137.88s)]
*  I only played y'all about 51 seconds, but the video is like 330. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4140.88s)]
*  And she's telling us that political elite and war mongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4143.88s)]
*  I didn't even know what the definition of fomenting was. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4154.88s)]
*  I had to look it up. OK? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4157.88s)]
*  Toci, why are you using big words at a time like this? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4159.88s)]
*  And for those who want to know, fomenting means instigating, stirring things up. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4162.88s)]
*  Toci, just say that. OK? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4165.88s)]
*  Political elite and war mongers are instigating and stirring things up. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4167.88s)]
*  And they don't care because they have access to nuclear shelters for themselves and for their families. OK? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4171.88s)]
*  Toci, I know I'm stupid. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4177.88s)]
*  OK, I tell y'all all the time I'm not the highest grade of weed in the dispensary, nor am I the strongest avenger. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4179.88s)]
*  But correct me if I'm wrong. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4184.88s)]
*  Aren't you the political elite? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4187.88s)]
*  You are the director of national intelligence. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4189.88s)]
*  OK, the principal advisor to the president, the principal advisor to the National Security Council and Homeland Security. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4191.88s)]
*  So you should be telling all the other political elite people, you should be telling them and all the war mongers to stop. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4197.88s)]
*  Stop instigating whatever has us on the brink of nuclear annihilation. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4204.88s)]
*  Play the clip again, Red. Please play it again one time for me. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4209.88s)]
*  As we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4212.88s)]
*  political elite and war mongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4218.88s)]
*  So it's up to us, the people, to speak up and demand an end to this madness. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4225.88s)]
*  We must reject this path to nuclear war and work toward a world where no one has to live in fear of a nuclear holocaust. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4233.88s)]
*  Tulsi, Tulsi, Tulsi, Tulsi, you're the director of national intelligence. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4242.88s)]
*  The reason I'm giving you donkey today is because what are we the people supposed to do with this information? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4247.88s)]
*  OK, see, this is what I've been talking about. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4252.88s)]
*  Government officials have one job when it comes to the American people. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4254.88s)]
*  Put money in our pocket and make us feel safe. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4257.88s)]
*  We are supposed to be out here living our best life while y'all handle stuff like threats of nuclear war. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4259.88s)]
*  But yet we got the director of national intelligence telling us that we need to speak up and demand an end to this madness. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4265.88s)]
*  Tulsi, nuclear war is too serious for a tweet and a call to action. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4273.88s)]
*  OK, a video on X and a call to action for we the people to just say stop. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4277.88s)]
*  That's all it takes is for us to reject this path to nuclear war and work toward a world where no one has to live in fear of a nuclear holocaust. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4282.88s)]
*  Well, Tulsi, I can assure you none of us want that. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4288.88s)]
*  OK, we don't have to reject it. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4290.88s)]
*  We never wanted it to be an option in the first place. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4292.88s)]
*  But I guess, you know, now it is and you want us to fix it. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4294.88s)]
*  Please give Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, the biggest he-haw. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4300.88s)]
*  Tulsi, I need you on somebody's TV network this morning. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4304.88s)]
*  OK, you have to explain this. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4311.88s)]
*  Tell us what you know. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4313.88s)]
*  OK, if someone is planning to let a nuke fly, it is your job to tell the world. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4316.88s)]
*  Don't give us half the information. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4322.88s)]
*  Tell us what's going on, damn it. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4324.88s)]
*  OK, give us time to repent for our sins. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4325.88s)]
*  OK, people want to get baptized. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4327.88s)]
*  Give me time to make peace with some people. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4329.88s)]
*  OK, Lauren LaRosa got to get the pants for the rest of the outfits you want to be. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4331.88s)]
*  OK, you can't just walk up to me, Tulsi, and say you're going to die and walk away. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4335.88s)]
*  No, excuse me, ma'am. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4341.88s)]
*  I got some questions. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4343.88s)]
*  She said all we have to say is stop. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4345.88s)]
*  Stop. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4347.88s)]
*  What the hell does Lauren LaRosa not have a little pant at the BT Awards have to do with this? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4349.88s)]
*  See, that's the problem. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4354.88s)]
*  That's all she caught. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4355.88s)]
*  She didn't catch the nuke. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4356.88s)]
*  She didn't catch the die. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4357.88s)]
*  She didn't catch the stop. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4358.88s)]
*  She didn't catch the, we're about there. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4359.88s)]
*  It's over. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4361.88s)]
*  All she caught was Lauren LaRosa didn't have any pants on at the BT Awards. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4362.88s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4366.88s)]
*  He's supposed to be, this is a teachable moment. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4367.88s)]
*  You're supposed to be teaching us that it was a public service announcement, a big announcement, right? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4370.88s)]
*  The teachable moment is. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4376.88s)]
*  And you can still think about Lauren not having on no damn pants and we just got threatened with nukes? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4377.88s)]
*  OK, we don't need a nuke, but we do need a missile to hit her closet. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4382.88s)]
*  That's it. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4385.88s)]
*  Tell you what, I'm not talking to you. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4386.88s)]
*  So she can have nothing else? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4387.88s)]
*  Well, she can start anew. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4389.88s)]

*  He built the roof. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4406.88s)]
*  He didn't give her a foundation. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4407.88s)]
*  And you can't build a house with just the roof. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4408.88s)]
*  You got to start with the foundation first. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4410.88s)]

*  It's like, give me, I still have to have a life myself, right? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4533.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4537.88s)]
*  And I don't want everything to be my boyfriend, my man, my man, my man. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4538.88s)]
*  Have you talked to him about this though? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4542.88s)]
*  Like, have you said, like, babe, I feel like it should be a compromise. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4544.88s)]
*  Like, yo, all right, maybe not the whole day, but I'll call you when I wake up in the morning, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4548.88s)]
*  and I'll call you when I get off of work, and then we can talk at night before I go [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4554.88s)]
*  to bed. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4558.88s)]
*  Like, are you laying that down like that? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4559.88s)]
*  That's what I say, but I say that all the time he gets offended. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4561.88s)]
*  Like, he being his feelings, like, oh, really? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4564.88s)]
*  Like, you don't want to talk? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4566.88s)]
*  I'm like, it's not that I don't want to talk to you. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4567.88s)]
*  Like, I'm listening to the breakfast club in the morning. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4569.88s)]
*  Stop calling me when I'm on my way to work. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4571.88s)]
*  This is my go-to time. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4573.88s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it is something that may have happened to him before in one of his [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4575.88s)]
*  previous relationships where, you know what I mean? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4579.88s)]
*  It wasn't his communication, it wasn't always like that. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4582.88s)]
*  He may not have had access to one of his exes, and sure, he was doing something, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4585.88s)]
*  messing around or something like that. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4590.88s)]
*  He don't want that to be the case here, but you can't pay for that. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4591.88s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4594.88s)]
*  You can't keep on talking to him all day, every day. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4596.88s)]
*  You either going to have to leave this man alone or you going to really have to put [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4599.88s)]
*  those boundaries in place. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4603.88s)]
*  Like, yo, I'm not talking to you all day. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4604.88s)]
*  It's just not going to happen like that for me because then he's going to run you away [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4607.88s)]
*  and then you're going to start, like... [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4610.88s)]
*  But that's what's happening. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4612.88s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4613.88s)]
*  Well, leave. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4614.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4615.88s)]
*  Leave. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4616.88s)]
*  Just, is that a problem, though, that she don't want to talk to her man like that? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4617.88s)]
*  That's not a problem. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4620.88s)]
*  The reason why it's not a problem is because you still have to have a life for yourself. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4621.88s)]
*  That's how I am. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4626.88s)]
*  When Chris is on the road, we don't have to talk all day. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4627.88s)]
*  Well, he might call you in the morning and say good morning. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4630.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4632.88s)]
*  He might call you and say what you're doing today. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4633.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4634.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4635.88s)]
*  When we first got together, yes, we were on the phone every day, all day. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4636.88s)]
*  You know, and then they get lonely in that truck. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4639.88s)]
*  They be wanting to drive. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4641.88s)]
*  I mean, you want to talk to somebody while they driving. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4642.88s)]
*  It passes time. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4644.88s)]
*  But you still need to be like a little independent because it's going to come a time where I [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4645.88s)]
*  can't talk to you every day. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4652.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4654.88s)]
*  Like, no. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4655.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4656.88s)]
*  And then what you're going to do? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4657.88s)]
*  You're going to think I'm automatically doing something because we broke this pattern. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4658.88s)]
*  That's now a daily routine. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4661.88s)]
*  Like, no. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4662.88s)]
*  He has to be able to not talk to you. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4663.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4666.88s)]
*  I'm trying to get him to understand that. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4667.88s)]
*  Like, we can have a healthy relationship without talking all day, every day. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4668.88s)]
*  Every day. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4673.88s)]
*  You're a loyal person, though. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4674.88s)]
*  Like, are you loyal? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4675.88s)]
*  I'm not, you didn't know anything. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4676.88s)]
*  I'm faced with them. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4677.88s)]
*  It's just like, sometimes I just remind me time and that's just how I'm designed. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4678.88s)]
*  And if he can't respect that, then he ain't the one for you. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4683.88s)]
*  I'm serious. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4687.88s)]
*  If he can't get out of his own way, you know what I mean? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4688.88s)]
*  Like, he's just not the one for you. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4691.88s)]
*  That's it. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4692.88s)]
*  You just got to protect your peace. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4693.88s)]
*  You got to have peace. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4694.88s)]
*  Don't need to live with you when you're doing that. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4695.88s)]
*  Jess is absolutely right. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4697.88s)]
*  My wife will tell me when she need me time. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4698.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4699.88s)]
*  And sometimes you don't even have to say it if you've been together long enough. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4700.88s)]
*  You just do what you're thinking. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4702.88s)]
*  No. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4703.88s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4704.88s)]
*  That's right. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4705.88s)]
*  So yeah, no. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4706.88s)]
*  That's not healthy, boo. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4707.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4708.88s)]
*  Yep. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4709.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4710.88s)]
*  No problem. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4711.88s)]
*  Good luck, mama. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4712.88s)]
*  Who throw all the women out there dating truck drivers that let their truck driving husbands [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4713.88s)]

*  Because no, that is not, no, that's not even what's happening over here. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4717.88s)]
*  There ain't no lot lizards up in Chris' truck. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4720.88s)]
*  It ain't none of that. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4722.88s)]
*  I wasn't talking about that. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4723.88s)]
*  And her man is not even a truck driver. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4724.88s)]

*  Well, it's the latest. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4991.88s)]
*  On the Breakfast Club. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4992.88s)]
*  Talk to me. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4993.88s)]
*  Okay, guys. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4994.88s)]
*  So yesterday I got a tip from Michelle. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4996.88s)]
*  Shout out to AT Alien, a blogger out of Atlanta that Portia Williams won in divorce court. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=4998.88s)]
*  A judge ruled to enforce her prenup with her ex, Simon Wobadia. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5004.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5009.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5010.88s)]
*  That is a huge deal because they've been going back and forth over several things, including the home that she currently lives in, the car, the Rolls Royce. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5011.88s)]
*  So I reached out to another source close to the court to figure out, OK, if she won and the judge going to enforce the prenup, what does that mean and what does she get? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5020.88s)]
*  So I'm told that Portia will get alimony, which would be 40k per month for about 14 to 15 months. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5027.88s)]
*  All her legal fees will be paid. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5034.88s)]
*  She'll receive the Rolls Royce that he brought. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5036.88s)]
*  All her attorney fees will be covered. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5039.88s)]
*  I said that already in the home, right? [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5041.88s)]
*  The house has been in question. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5043.88s)]
*  Now, there's a little bit of the clauses with the home. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5045.88s)]
*  So there's one or two things that can happen. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5047.88s)]
*  So Portia has from 2024, which is when they ended to 2027 to decide whether she's going to stay in the home. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5049.88s)]
*  And it's a seven million dollar home. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5055.88s)]
*  And in order to stay in the home, she's going to have to refinance to basically buy Simon out of his portion because he does get 50 percent of the equity in the home or she can sell the home. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5056.88s)]
*  Now, the issue with the home and why it's been such a big conversation from what I'm told is that it was a premarital property. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5066.88s)]
*  So he actually bought the home with his own money, Simon, for what I'm told before they entered into the marriage. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5071.88s)]
*  But at this point, she has these three years to figure out what she wants to do and stay in the home while she figures it out. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5078.88s)]
*  And while she's in the home, he also Simon is responsible to cover all of the expenses. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5085.88s)]
*  So mortgage, any expenses that come. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5089.88s)]
*  Is the house paid off? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5092.88s)]
*  Is it painful or no? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5093.88s)]
*  No, it's not painful. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5094.88s)]
*  It's not painful. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5095.88s)]
*  So he has to cover all of the expenses while she is there. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5096.88s)]
*  And I'm also told that Simon is exploring the options of an appeal. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5099.88s)]
*  He has 30 days to file this with the court. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5103.88s)]
*  Now, Simon does none of that. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5105.88s)]
*  What could happen to him because he can't come back to the country. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5106.88s)]
*  It's not like they can bring him back and arrest him. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5109.88s)]
*  What do you mean by does none of that? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5111.88s)]
*  So if he says, you know what, I'm already you already deported me. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5112.88s)]
*  I'm in Africa or I'm in Dubai. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5115.88s)]
*  I ain't gonna do nothing to it because you can't arrest him. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5118.88s)]
*  Oh, you mean like he's not going to appeal for the home? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5120.88s)]
*  No, meaning if he doesn't pay the mortgage, if he doesn't want to get [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5122.88s)]
*  none of that stuff that he's supposed to be paying, he just says, you know what? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5124.88s)]
*  I'm out. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5127.88s)]
*  I mean, he still legally would have to go through whatever the consequences [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5128.88s)]
*  for that is. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5131.88s)]
*  And also, too, he still has his defamation lawsuit on the other side with [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5132.88s)]
*  Portia. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5135.88s)]
*  So he's still, I mean, he hiding like he's still actively going through [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5136.88s)]
*  things and he plans to appeal. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5139.88s)]
*  So he ain't about to hide. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5140.88s)]
*  So he just have to deal with the consequences. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5141.88s)]
*  All I know is Simon would give all that up to have American citizenship and [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5142.88s)]
*  that ice cream sandwich we call capital feedback. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5146.88s)]
*  OK, salute to Portia Williams. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5149.88s)]
*  AKA Young Honeybun. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5151.88s)]
*  That's what we call him. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5153.88s)]
*  All right. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5154.88s)]
*  Capital P, clean up. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5155.88s)]
*  OK. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5156.88s)]
*  Mr. Gurbade has probably bit off more than he could chew and was probably like, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5157.88s)]
*  thank you God. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5160.88s)]
*  That's a big bite. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5161.88s)]
*  You say capital P? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5162.88s)]
*  Yes, I am going back home. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5163.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5165.88s)]
*  And I'm told, because I asked what was their vibe in court. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5166.88s)]
*  I'm told they didn't even speak to each other directly. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5170.88s)]
*  They just let their counsel speak to each other and they could have if they [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5172.88s)]
*  wanted to. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5174.88s)]
*  And they were in court all day, 930. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5175.88s)]
*  Were they on Zoom or something? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5176.88s)]
*  They were on Zoom. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5177.88s)]
*  Yes, they were on Zoom. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5178.88s)]
*  But they could have done a breakout room on Zoom if they wanted to have a [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5179.88s)]
*  conversation. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5182.88s)]
*  They didn't though. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5183.88s)]
*  930 to 7 o'clock p.m. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5184.88s)]
*  And Simon walked away pissed. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5185.88s)]
*  Damn. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5187.88s)]
*  Sure. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5188.88s)]
*  What time was it in Africa? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5189.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5190.88s)]
*  It was time for him to get ready to pay that 40K a month. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5191.88s)]
*  That's what time it was. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5194.88s)]
*  Damn. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5195.88s)]
*  So in other news, speaking of Jish, Dame Dash, a judge has ordered Dame Dash to [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5196.88s)]
*  hand over full ownership of several of his companies and Fem copyrights to pay [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5201.88s)]
*  off a debt from a lawsuit. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5206.88s)]
*  Damn. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5207.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5208.88s)]
*  So shout out to allhiphop.com and Grouchy Greg who broke this story. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5209.88s)]
*  So y'all remember we were talking about like the money that Dame Dash owed. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5213.88s)]
*  It was a ton of different things. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5217.88s)]
*  Child support. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5218.88s)]
*  There was like a lawsuit between him and a filmmaker named Josh Weber. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5219.88s)]
*  So the taxes and all that stuff, remember they did the auction and they were [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5222.88s)]
*  trying to figure out how they were going to pay each other. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5226.88s)]
*  So a part of that was this filmmaker's lawsuit. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5228.88s)]
*  And the auction went down. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5230.88s)]
*  Dame Dash lost his one-third stake in Rockefeller. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5232.88s)]
*  But this filmmaker was not paid. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5235.88s)]
*  There wasn't enough money to cover the debt that Dame Dash allegedly owes to [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5237.88s)]
*  him, right? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5240.88s)]
*  So there's a little over $800,000 that is due. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5241.88s)]
*  And a judge is basically saying that Dame has to give up several companies, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5243.88s)]
*  including Dash Films and copyrights to several movies, including Honor Up and [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5247.88s)]
*  Too Honorable, in order to get this paid. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5251.88s)]
*  What about the network? [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5253.88s)]
*  The American New Network? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5254.88s)]
*  That is not listed on here. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5255.88s)]
*  It is Dash Films, Blue Rock LLC, Black Rock LLC, Interest in Lebanon LLC, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5257.88s)]
*  Ocean's East Improvements LLC, and 1996 Song. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5261.88s)]
*  So unless that network is under one of these companies, but that wasn't [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5265.88s)]
*  specifically named in the document. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5268.88s)]
*  What was that $8 million number I saw floating around? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5270.88s)]
*  It was any? [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5272.88s)]
*  $800,000. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5273.88s)]
*  I saw that too, but I thought I saw something else. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5275.88s)]
*  But that's from, remember there was a huge amount of money he owed because of [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5277.88s)]
*  child support, because of this lawsuit. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5280.88s)]
*  And taxes too, right? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5281.88s)]
*  Yes, that was all combined. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5282.88s)]
*  Remember, but they tried to sell it off in the auction. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5283.88s)]
*  But it was like first come first served. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5285.88s)]
*  Not first come first served. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5287.88s)]
*  They had to figure out the picking order of who was going to be paid what. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5288.88s)]
*  This filmmaker was not paid from that because there wasn't enough money to go [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5290.88s)]
*  around. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5293.88s)]
*  So now they're asking for these companies. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5294.88s)]
*  They're asking for the rights to these movies. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5296.88s)]
*  And what they're going to do, the government is going to do is they're going [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5298.88s)]
*  to do another auction and they're trying to pay this man from this film with [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5301.88s)]
*  this auction. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5305.88s)]
*  And whatever is left over will go back to Dame Dash. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5306.88s)]
*  Now Dame Dash has until June 16th to make the auction not happen by filing an [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5308.88s)]
*  objection. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5313.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5314.88s)]
*  Monday. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5315.88s)]
*  June 16th, you got until Monday. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5316.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5318.88s)]
*  I've seen everybody laughing. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5319.88s)]
*  And I would say this, you don't laugh, you learn. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5321.88s)]
*  You don't laugh, you learn. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5323.88s)]
*  And I told you guys years ago, Charlamagne and myself said a long time ago, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5325.88s)]
*  entrepreneurship is amazing, right? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5328.88s)]
*  But it's hard. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5330.88s)]
*  But having a job is not a bad thing. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5331.88s)]
*  Stability ain't a weakness. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5333.88s)]
*  It could be a strategy. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5334.88s)]
*  So don't think if you have a job you can't be an entrepreneur as well. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5335.88s)]
*  You can do both. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5338.88s)]
*  Like I said, stability is not a weakness. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5339.88s)]
*  It's a strategy to do the things that you want to do. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5341.88s)]
*  And don't laugh at Dame Dash. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5344.88s)]
*  You can learn from it. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5346.88s)]
*  And I will say salute to everybody who was motivated by the interview Dame Dash did [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5347.88s)]
*  up here on the Breakfast Club 10 years ago. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5351.88s)]
*  But when you talk about being your own boss, when you talk about ownership, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5353.88s)]
*  all those conversations are great. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5357.88s)]
*  But Dame never really gave a blueprint to do it. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5359.88s)]
*  You know? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5362.88s)]
*  And I wonder for those who were inspired by that convo 10 years ago, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5363.88s)]
*  how do you feel now seeing the situation Dame is in? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5366.88s)]
*  Or do you just take the message and not listen to the messenger? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5369.88s)]
*  Because I think over the last decade, there has been a lot of people who have told [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5372.88s)]
*  you how to do it, as opposed to just telling you to do it. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5375.88s)]
*  It's one thing to say, be your own boss. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5378.88s)]
*  Quit your job. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5380.88s)]
*  You don't need to work for nobody. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5381.88s)]
*  Your boss is your daddy. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5382.88s)]
*  My son sells cookies. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5383.88s)]
*  All of that is cool. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5384.88s)]
*  But you still have to give a blueprint on how to do that. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5385.88s)]
*  And I think over the last decade, we've seen these conversations of financial [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5388.88s)]
*  literacy grow in our communities, and people have given you some blueprints. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5392.88s)]
*  Great conversations. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5395.88s)]
*  But like you said, if you don't know how, you have to learn. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5396.88s)]
*  And sometimes being stable is not a weakness, right? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5400.88s)]
*  Getting your monthly check and having health insurance is not a weakness. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5403.88s)]
*  It should be a strategy to get to where you need to be. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5407.88s)]
*  Or listen to people who actually have successful businesses. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5410.88s)]
*  We have a genre of people who are making money, telling people how to make money. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5413.88s)]
*  That can't be the business. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5418.88s)]
*  But the thing is, you got to know who's really doing it, right? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5420.88s)]
*  Because we all thought Dame was really doing it. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5424.88s)]
*  That's why I love John O'Brien. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5426.88s)]
*  But then you see John O'Brien, and then you see things like when I seen T.D.E.D. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5427.88s)]
*  the other day, and he was talking about, you know what, I jumped on a spirit flight from [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5431.88s)]
*  LA to Vegas to get to the show. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5435.88s)]
*  It only cost me $99. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5437.88s)]
*  If I flew private, it would have been $12,000. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5439.88s)]
*  He got it, but he's smart with it. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5441.88s)]
*  Hey, John O'Brien, Don Peebles, Cheryl McKissick, Tyler Perry. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5443.88s)]
*  I'm listening to people who actually have businesses, you know what I'm saying, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5446.88s)]
*  who can tell me how to build that. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5450.88s)]
*  Hove. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5452.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5453.88s)]
*  I don't like, I tried, I didn't want to say Tyler Hove just because they're the entertainers. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5454.88s)]
*  That's why I said Cheryl, Don, and John O'Brien. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5457.88s)]
*  But a lot of them came from, like we've seen Hove where he came from and what he's on. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5459.88s)]
*  So Tyler Perry the same. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5462.88s)]
*  Man, I feel like that's just a stab saying Hove right now at a time like that. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5464.88s)]
*  Oh, damn. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5467.88s)]
*  I didn't even think about it. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5468.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think you did. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5469.88s)]
*  Say it again, Justin. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5470.88s)]
*  Damn. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5471.88s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5472.88s)]
*  Did they say anything about the cookies? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5473.88s)]
*  Yo, shut up, man. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5474.88s)]
*  That is the latest with Lauren. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5475.88s)]
*  I'm being honest, seriously. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5476.88s)]
*  That is the latest with Lauren. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5477.88s)]
*  When we come back, we got the People's Choice Mix. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5479.88s)]
*  Don't go anywhere. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5481.88s)]
*  It's the Breakfast Club. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5482.88s)]
*  Good morning. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5483.88s)]
*  You're checking out the Breakfast Club. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5484.88s)]
*  Morning, everybody. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5485.88s)]
*  It's DJ Envy, Jess Hilarious, Charlamagne the Guy. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5486.88s)]
*  We are the Breakfast Club. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5490.88s)]
*  Now we got a salute to Rodney Jerkins for joining us this morning. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5492.88s)]
*  Man, salute to Rodney Jerkins, man. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5495.88s)]
*  Doc Child, one of the super producers of our generation. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5497.88s)]
*  He's getting inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5500.88s)]
*  That's right. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5503.88s)]
*  He also brought his artist, John Keith, with him as well. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5504.88s)]
*  His new album comes out June 27th. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5506.88s)]
*  It's called Grow Wing. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5508.88s)]
*  So salute to Rodney Jerkins, man. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5509.88s)]
*  He produced so many records, man. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5512.88s)]
*  So many records. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5513.88s)]
*  It was from Michael Jackson to Whitney Houston to Brandy to A Boogie with a Hoodie. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5514.88s)]
*  It was so many, George. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5520.88s)]
*  And then he was so young doing all that. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5521.88s)]
*  That's right. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5523.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5524.88s)]
*  He young now, but I'm just saying he was so young working with all them old legends like that. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5525.88s)]
*  That's right. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5528.88s)]
*  I forgot to ask him about the resurgence of that Tamiya song that everybody do the line dance. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5529.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5533.88s)]
*  Can you name that song? [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5534.88s)]
*  Can't Get Enough. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5535.88s)]
*  Can't Get Enough. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5536.88s)]
*  Yeah, he produced that as well. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5537.88s)]
*  Sure did. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxvypb2QjFc&t=5538.88s)]
