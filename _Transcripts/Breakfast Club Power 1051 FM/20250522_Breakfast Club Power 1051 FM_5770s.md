*  Now the Israeli ambassador to the United States [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=243.32s)]
*  said they were a young couple about to get engaged. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=245.48s)]
*  Very sad news for that couple, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=248.92s)]
*  but I will keep you guys posted [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=250.4s)]
*  as this story continues to develop. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=252.0s)]
*  Very sad news and not helpful at all. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=254.84s)]
*  You know, throwing fuel on a fire [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=257.32s)]
*  that's been going on forever. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=260.0s)]
*  Hello, and we're supposed to be working on peace talks here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=262.0s)]
*  You know, but switching gears, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  President Trump met with South African president, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=267.28s)]
*  surreal Ramaphosa in the Oval Office [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=270.4s)]
*  at the White House yesterday. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=272.32s)]
*  This comes as dozens of white South Africans [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=273.52s)]
*  were accepted into the US as refugees earlier this month. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  Now Ramaphosa called his citizens cowards [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=278.96s)]
*  for resettling in the US. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  And during the meeting, Trump alleged that South Africa [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=282.67999999999995s)]
*  was committing genocide against the white Afrikaners, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  which is not the case. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  Now he showed outdated video clips to Ramaphosa [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=289.72s)]
*  calling it proof of that genocide. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=292.48s)]
*  Let's take a listen to the comments [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=295.08s)]
*  between South African president Ramaphosa [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  and President Trump. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  They're being executed and they happen to be white [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=300.84000000000003s)]
*  and most of them happen to be farmers. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=304.24s)]
*  And that's a tough situation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=306.76s)]
*  I don't know how you explain that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=308.4s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=310.24s)]
*  You are a partner, partner of South Africa [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=311.68s)]
*  and you are raising concerns. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  These are concerns that we are willing to talk to you about. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  So Ramaphosa of course denied the allegations [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=323.04s)]
*  telling Trump that there is a minority party [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  behind the tensions between blacks and whites. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=327.92s)]
*  He went on to stress that he does wanna sit down [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=330.56s)]
*  and continue talks about the issue. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  After the meeting, he also said he was happy [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=334.36s)]
*  that talks between the US and South Africa [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=336.32s)]
*  will continue regarding trade and more, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=338.2s)]
*  adding that that was his goal for the meeting [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=340.24s)]
*  to reset the relationship between the two nations. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=342.8s)]
*  South African native Elon Musk has been outspoken, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  has been an outspoken critic of the current government [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=348.84s)]
*  and he was also in attendance of that meeting. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=351.76s)]
*  Now the comment that stuck out to me [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=354.68s)]
*  was when President Trump said in reference [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  to the white Afrikan refugees, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=358.88s)]
*  let's take a listen to that audio. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=361.28s)]
*  We have many people that feel they're being persecuted [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=364.52s)]
*  and they're coming to the United States. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=367.28s)]
*  So we take from many locations, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  if we feel there's persecution or genocide going on. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  So saying that in one breath [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=376.92s)]
*  while actively deporting migrants who come to the US, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=378.24s)]
*  seeking asylum from the very same thing [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=381.0s)]
*  is crazy work, Mr. President. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=383.8s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder how poor and disenfranchised [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=385.72s)]
*  white people here in America feel about the acceptance [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=387.36s)]
*  of the white Afrikaners. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=390.24s)]
*  Because it's the same thing, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=392.56s)]
*  Like if you were complaining about, you know, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=393.64s)]
*  these other people that were coming in from other countries [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  getting resources and everything, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=397.24s)]
*  I would think you would complain about that as well, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=399.40000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, absolutely. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, Kufu Flagg was the number one pick in the draft. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=403.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, that was big for white Africans, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  but I mean, other than that, you know, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  what the hell's going on? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=409.36s)]
*  All right, Charlamagne, clock the T then. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=410.88000000000005s)]
*  Switching gears, the House Rules Committee [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=413.12s)]
*  is advancing President Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=415.32000000000005s)]
*  Now the panel voted eight to four to advance the measure, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=419.04s)]
*  which included last minute changes [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=421.68s)]
*  designed to appease both moderates and conservatives [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  who withheld support from the legislation. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=426.6s)]
*  Now we'll now head to the House floor [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=429.56s)]
*  where there is a hope that a vote will be held today [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=431.96s)]
*  and it will be sent to the Senate by Memorial Day. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=435.0s)]
*  So as House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  this bill, big, beautiful bill is on track [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=440.35999999999996s)]
*  to head to the Senate by Memorial Day. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=443.91999999999996s)]
*  But that's your front page news for 6 a.m., 7 a.m. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=446.52s)]
*  We'll talk about a Qatari jet that has been accepted [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=448.88s)]
*  and some incidents going on with the DOJ. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=451.24s)]
*  The DOJ has been very busy, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=454.84s)]
*  so we'll get into that at seven, so stick around. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=456.35999999999996s)]

*  like a regular team and don't be doing all this drama. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=600.64s)]
*  I can't deal with it, bro. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=603.48s)]
*  I cannot deal with idea of thinking we gonna win [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=605.16s)]
*  and then being in the position to win [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=610.16s)]
*  and then going to overtime and losing [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=612.08s)]
*  and having Halliburton do Reggie's choke. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=614.44s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=617.2s)]

*  Right now, Anthony Mason's probably rolling his brain. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=620.04s)]
*  They have Lightskin, Tyler Halliburton [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=622.84s)]
*  doing the choking sign in the garden. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=625.6s)]
*  Right now, if the Knicks are gonna lose, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=628.08s)]

*  If Anthony Mason was playing on that Knicks team last night, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=639.24s)]
*  they would have won because Anthony Mason plays defense. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=643.36s)]
*  I watched the last five minutes of that game [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=645.88s)]
*  and I know everybody was like, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=647.48s)]
*  oh, they went on a 10-0 run after Brunson took the bench, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=648.32s)]
*  but I was watching they defense. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, if they keep playing like that, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=652.08s)]
*  they gonna lose this game. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=653.6s)]
*  I could just feel it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=654.5200000000001s)]
*  You could see it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=656.0s)]
*  The defense was terrible. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=656.88s)]
*  But if we don't lose, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=658.24s)]
*  I don't wanna lose in no dramatic fashion. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=660.48s)]
*  New York is as stressed as it is. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=662.96s)]

*  And the city is expressing itself. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=669.36s)]
*  I don't want the drama. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=671.24s)]
*  Just lose like a regular team. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=672.44s)]
*  Get blown out by like 40 [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=674.08s)]

*  But it's giving us some kind of hope [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=679.72s)]
*  and having them lose. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=681.96s)]
*  I don't give a damn. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=683.1600000000001s)]

*  Yes. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1081.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1081.88s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1084.04s)]
*  So yesterday in court, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1084.88s)]
*  we heard from a Homeland Security Investigations agent [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1085.88s)]
*  who was a part of the team that ran into the Miami house. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1088.4s)]
*  They finished his testimony. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1091.0s)]
*  We talked to, or they talked to, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1093.28s)]
*  a clinical and forensic psychologist. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1095.0s)]
*  Her name is Dawn Hughes, George Kaplan, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1097.52s)]
*  a former executive assistant, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1099.72s)]
*  and it was a ton of stuff that went down. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1101.2s)]
*  I think most people right now are like, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1103.24s)]
*  what is about to happen when Kid Cudi comes into court though? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1104.8s)]
*  We already know. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1107.3600000000001s)]
*  What you know? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1108.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, if you read the indictment, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1109.44s)]
*  the indictment clearly says arson, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1112.04s)]
*  so clearly the alleged Diddy blowing up Kid Cudi's car [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1113.72s)]
*  is arson. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1117.8s)]
*  Yes, allegedly. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1118.8400000000001s)]
*  That is exactly what he's gonna be there to speak to, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1120.6399999999999s)]
*  and he's gonna probably provide a lot of the background [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1123.0s)]
*  context to his and Cassie's dating fling [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1125.36s)]
*  or whatever that was, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1128.48s)]
*  and the events that led up to Diddy allegedly getting [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1129.48s)]
*  so upset to have to do that. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1132.36s)]
*  Now, yesterday in court, at the end of court, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1133.56s)]
*  they kind of let you know what's about to happen [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1135.4399999999998s)]
*  the next day. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1136.6s)]
*  They said, the prosecutors had said, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1137.4399999999998s)]
*  look, tomorrow we're gonna interview five people [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1139.28s)]
*  on the stand. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1141.48s)]
*  I said, whoa, how is that gonna happen? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1142.32s)]
*  And they said, because to the judge, they said, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1144.48s)]
*  well, that is gonna be possible because the testimonies [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1146.8799999999999s)]
*  will be short. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1149.68s)]
*  And that kind of caught me off guard because I have assumed [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1150.76s)]
*  that Kid Cudi would be not a short testimony [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1154.0800000000002s)]
*  because they've been mentioning him every week in court [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1156.8400000000001s)]
*  since court has started, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1159.2s)]
*  but maybe they plan to get right on to what [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1160.72s)]
*  they gotta get to. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1162.44s)]
*  Well, I was gonna ask you, what does short look like? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1163.28s)]
*  I don't know time-wise what short looks like, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1165.68s)]
*  but I will say when we had- [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1167.3600000000001s)]
*  Because you've been in there. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1168.2s)]
*  You're in there every day, so what has been short? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1169.04s)]
*  I know Dawn was 20 minutes. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1170.92s)]
*  That was short. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1172.4s)]
*  Cassie's mom was also short. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1173.3200000000002s)]
*  For instance, an example of not short, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1176.04s)]
*  Cassie took about, what, like two days? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1178.04s)]
*  Two days, yeah. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1180.44s)]
*  Two and a half days. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1181.28s)]
*  So it's given, maybe we might get an hour. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1182.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1185.1599999999999s)]
*  Out of the Kid Cudi testimony, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1186.0s)]
*  I'm not really for sure exactly what time they're gonna go, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1188.72s)]
*  but they mentioned that it would be short. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1190.68s)]
*  He's actually first up on the stand after they finished [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1192.56s)]
*  with this former executive assistant of Diddy. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1195.48s)]
*  So I'll be there. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1198.0s)]
*  Who's the former executive assistant? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1199.52s)]
*  His name is George Kaplan, and he was a- [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1200.96s)]
*  Oh, I thought you were talking about- [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1202.68s)]
*  Christina? [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1205.32s)]
*  No. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1206.1599999999999s)]
*  Capricorn? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1208.36s)]
*  Capricorn, no. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1209.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1210.04s)]
*  No, not yet. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1210.8799999999999s)]
*  No, those, she's not on the list to come this week. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1211.72s)]
*  Gotcha. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1215.96s)]
*  Or today or whatever, but no, George Kaplan, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1216.8s)]
*  he used to work for Diddy under Combs Enterprises, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1218.28s)]
*  and he's already beginning to testify [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1221.08s)]
*  about having to set up freak off rooms, allegedly, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1223.3999999999999s)]
*  and allegedly, he was sent to buy drugs a couple times, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1226.08s)]
*  and he used his bad boy card to do so, allegedly, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1230.52s)]
*  so you know where they're going with him. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1232.8799999999999s)]
*  What about the guns? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1234.04s)]
*  Because I saw the FBI release those pictures, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1234.92s)]
*  and everybody was so caught up on the dildos [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  that had the serial numbers scratched off. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1239.96s)]
*  Oh my God, dildos have serial numbers? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1242.28s)]
*  Yes, Diddy had dildos with serial numbers scratched off. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1244.1599999999999s)]
*  But what about the guns? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1246.68s)]
*  So let me tell you something about these guns. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1248.44s)]
*  Not the untraceable dildos. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1249.84s)]
*  I don't know if he charged with these guns. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1251.68s)]
*  Is this part of the RICO? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1252.9199999999998s)]
*  I believe that what they're gonna try and bring in [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1254.12s)]
*  with the RICO is they're gonna use the guns [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1256.32s)]
*  and the drugs to show, and I'm gonna look this up [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1259.3999999999999s)]
*  to make sure that I'm hitting this right to the nail, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1262.28s)]
*  because people will be mad when I don't, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1264.36s)]
*  but what I'm assuming that they're trying to show is [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1265.56s)]
*  is that he used all of that to add to the force [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1267.6s)]
*  and the intimidation and things of that nature, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1270.3999999999999s)]
*  but I'm gonna look that up to answer you exactly. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1272.44s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanna know if he's getting charged [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1274.72s)]
*  with the guns, because there are guns with the serial numbers [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  scratched off, automatic weapons. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1278.44s)]
*  That's a big federal charge. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1279.56s)]
*  But let me tell you, the way Diddy's team came in the cross [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1281.0s)]
*  about them guns, I think Tini, or Tani Garagos, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1284.0s)]
*  Mark Garagos' daughter, she is not to be played with. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1288.28s)]
*  So they did, the special agent, we went through his home, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1290.72s)]
*  they talked about all these different guns they found [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1293.92s)]
*  in the magazines and all these things. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1295.72s)]
*  She is like an evidence expert. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1297.4s)]
*  She got back up on that stand and she said, hold on. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1299.24s)]
*  So what's your process? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1301.48s)]
*  Y'all take pictures before and after [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1302.8400000000001s)]
*  so that we can make sure that you guys [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1304.0400000000002s)]
*  are chronicling this stuff right and accurate. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1306.8000000000002s)]
*  He says, yes. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1308.92s)]
*  She brought back up all those photos with those guns, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1309.88s)]
*  no photos before for a lot of the things. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1312.8000000000002s)]
*  And she's like, well, were you the person [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1314.92s)]
*  that took the photos? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1316.72s)]
*  The man testifying said, no. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1317.5600000000002s)]
*  She said, well, I'm looking at a bunch of stuff [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1318.64s)]
*  at the bottom of a closet floor. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1321.5600000000002s)]
*  Some of these things included where they found the guns. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1323.3999999999999s)]
*  They opened boxes and found different things, right? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1325.84s)]
*  She's like, can you tell me which cubby [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1328.12s)]
*  these guns came out of? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1330.12s)]
*  He said, no. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1331.8s)]
*  And she said, okay, so you can't, she's making the point, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1332.9199999999998s)]
*  they're trying to draw a very clear distinction [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1335.3999999999999s)]
*  between how do you even know that these are his [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1337.52s)]
*  when they're either, there's serial numbers on them [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1339.52s)]
*  that, or they're not. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1342.12s)]
*  You didn't do any DNA testing, like at all, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1343.1599999999999s)]
*  and you could have, and it's easier for you [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1346.24s)]
*  to do DNA testing when you find these guns [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1348.6399999999999s)]
*  inside of a home versus outside in all of the elements. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1350.3999999999999s)]
*  But it's his home though. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1354.24s)]
*  They found them in there, so they're his. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1355.4799999999998s)]
*  But they're trying to, they're- [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1357.6s)]
*  If you find guns in somebody's residence [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1358.9199999999998s)]
*  and nobody claims them, everybody in that residence [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1360.9599999999998s)]
*  is probably gonna get shot. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1363.6399999999999s)]
*  It's responsible, right? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1364.4799999999998s)]
*  But you know how many people are, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1365.32s)]
*  and she also made a point about how many people [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1366.1599999999999s)]
*  were actually put into custody when they got to the home. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1367.9199999999998s)]
*  You know where she's going with this. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1370.6799999999998s)]
*  But the fact, I'm saying that because I don't know [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1372.08s)]
*  what a juror is gonna be thinking about it, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1374.8s)]
*  but the fact that she was even able to create that thought [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1376.84s)]
*  as a conversation, I was like, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1380.04s)]
*  oh, she's really, really good at this. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1381.32s)]
*  But I'm gonna look that up for you with the Rico. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1383.36s)]
*  And then also the woman that the psychologist yesterday, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1385.76s)]
*  the clinical and forensic psychologist [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1388.8s)]
*  that they spoke to, Dawn Hughes, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1390.6s)]
*  I thought it was gonna be a snooze fest. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1392.2s)]
*  She was actually the best witness yesterday. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1393.72s)]
*  She spoke generally to like, you know, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1396.48s)]
*  why victims of alleged domestic violence [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1398.48s)]
*  and sexual abuse go back. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1401.6399999999999s)]
*  And oh my God, she was so on point [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1403.8s)]
*  with a lot of the things that she was saying. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1406.1599999999999s)]
*  And even when she spoke directly to memory [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1407.52s)]
*  and trauma and how it makes you not remember things, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1410.08s)]
*  of course the defense came in and did what they did. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1412.28s)]
*  And it was very interesting to watch them cross this expert. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1415.0s)]
*  But- [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1418.6s)]
*  So the semen was just warm yesterday. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1419.76s)]
*  Today the semen gonna be hot. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1421.36s)]
*  The semen was like, it was like room temperature yesterday. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1422.6s)]
*  It wasn't even like heated. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  Today it's gonna get a little microwave action. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1427.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1430.28s)]
*  The semen gonna be hot today. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1431.12s)]
*  What else we got in front page? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1432.04s)]
*  I mean, the latest with Lauren. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1433.24s)]
*  Well, we're gonna get into CZA, Tory Lane's, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1435.9199999999998s)]
*  but we have a couple of audios [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1438.28s)]
*  and I don't wanna shorten that. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1439.36s)]
*  But I will say congratulations in the next hour. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1440.8s)]
*  We're gonna talk about this- [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1443.68s)]
*  On Glorilla's nose. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1444.52s)]
*  Jess has been talking about Glorilla's nose all morning long. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1445.76s)]
*  Yes, girl. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1448.92s)]
*  And she confirmed she was like, and it got it done. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1450.76s)]
*  Yeah, what's up? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1453.16s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1454.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little nosy. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1454.84s)]
*  That little nose. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1456.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1457.28s)]
*  Can y'all explain to me like, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1458.1s)]
*  what do women see when they wanna get a nose job? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1459.08s)]
*  Cause I mean, all plastic surgery is personal, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1461.36s)]
*  but nose jobs are really personal [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1463.28s)]
*  because I don't think the average person [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1464.72s)]
*  looks at an individual and goes, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1466.88s)]
*  oh, that person needs a nose job. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1468.1200000000001s)]
*  So what do y'all see when y'all look in the mirror [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1469.5600000000002s)]
*  and make sure I wanna do that? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1471.2800000000002s)]
*  I just think, you know, is what you see in the mirror. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1472.44s)]
*  Like maybe she felt like her nose was too big, obviously, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1475.0s)]
*  cause she wouldn't go get, you know, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1477.6000000000001s)]
*  she wouldn't get a little one, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1478.68s)]
*  but she obviously felt like it was too big for her. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1479.96s)]
*  I've felt like the same way my whole life, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1484.3200000000002s)]
*  but I'm not getting a nose job. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1487.44s)]
*  You got a beautiful nose. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1488.96s)]
*  I know, I know, but when I was pregnant, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1490.3600000000001s)]
*  this last time with Marley, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1492.68s)]
*  it had spread like a couch and it didn't go back. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1494.2800000000002s)]
*  And that was like a love seat. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1497.32s)]
*  I never got the same nose that I had back yet [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1498.16s)]
*  before I had Marley. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1500.96s)]
*  Wait. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1503.44s)]
*  Cause you can't fix your nostrils. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1504.28s)]
*  Like you got big nostrils. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1505.52s)]
*  At least your whole body snapped back though, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1506.84s)]
*  cause some girls don't get their bodies back. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1508.64s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1510.6s)]
*  No, when I flared my nostrils, it's worse. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1512.64s)]
*  You can't close that. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1516.28s)]
*  I know, but it was smaller. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  My nose was smaller before I had my daughter. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1519.1200000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1522.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and that was still wide. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1523.2s)]
*  I wanna be looking at your nose all day. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1524.48s)]
*  I didn't even realize that you still had the same nose. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1527.12s)]
*  You need to stop being angry. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1529.04s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1529.8799999999999s)]
*  You get angry and yes, and you look, you do like this. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1530.72s)]
*  And then you be like, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1532.56s)]
*  I wouldn't know. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1533.3999999999999s)]
*  And then we can see right. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1534.24s)]
*  Every time you get mad, you do like this. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1535.08s)]
*  And I'm like, damn. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1536.68s)]
*  But glow nose, it's like she did it [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1538.08s)]
*  for more of like the contour. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1540.04s)]
*  Like it's like pinched right here. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1541.16s)]
*  And you know, it's pinched all the way through. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1542.56s)]
*  Yeah, the contour just gives you that. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1544.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1546.8799999999999s)]
*  You remember the little noses on the Kleenex box? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1547.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1550.28s)]
*  Like she got little nose. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1551.12s)]
*  And then this red. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1552.28s)]
*  Like a little one. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1553.12s)]
*  Glow likes it, I love it. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1554.44s)]
*  Yeah, she does. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1555.52s)]

*  Good morning, Morgan. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1614.72s)]
*  Good morning, good morning. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1615.88s)]
*  All right, let's get back into it. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1616.76s)]
*  So the US has officially accepted that luxury jet [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1617.8400000000001s)]
*  from Qatar to use as Air Force One. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1621.48s)]
*  The Defense Department confirmed the news on Wednesday. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1623.96s)]
*  A spokesperson said Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1626.72s)]
*  accepted a Boeing 747 from the Middle Eastern country [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1629.68s)]
*  in accordance with all federal rules and regulations. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1633.52s)]
*  Maybe because he can accept it. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1636.56s)]
*  I'm not sure, but you know, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1638.04s)]
*  this is actually supposed to be a gift for President Trump. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1639.32s)]
*  They said the DOD will work to ensure proper security [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1641.88s)]
*  measures are considered for an aircraft [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1645.5200000000002s)]
*  used to transport President Trump. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1647.6000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1649.64s)]
*  Is Pete Hegseth a government official? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1650.48s)]
*  He is, so maybe he can't, he accepted. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1652.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out the people. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1653.92s)]
*  The US Constitution prohibits government officials, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1655.7600000000002s)]
*  government officials from accepting gifts [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1660.2800000000002s)]
*  from any King, Prince or foreign state. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1662.92s)]
*  The reality is what they're doing is unconstitutional. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1665.2s)]
*  And that's just it. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1668.5200000000002s)]
*  And as long as people, you know, don't push back on it, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1669.68s)]
*  don't show no resistance towards it, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1672.88s)]
*  then that behavior will continue to be normalized. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1674.48s)]
*  And I guess it's normalized now. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1676.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah, you ain't lying. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1678.24s)]
*  I was trying to figure out the loophole in this, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1680.32s)]
*  but moving on, in other news, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1682.16s)]
*  the Justice Department is dismissing Biden-era investigations [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1683.8s)]
*  into the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1687.44s)]
*  Now, DOJ made the announcement on Wednesday saying [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1690.28s)]
*  the lawsuits were filed last minute [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1692.32s)]
*  by the Biden administration [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1694.2s)]
*  after President Trump was reelected. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1695.28s)]
*  The lawsuits accused the departments of widespread patterns [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1697.72s)]
*  of unconstitutional policing practices tied to race. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1700.32s)]
*  It said its civil rights division will dismiss the lawsuits [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1703.92s)]
*  against the departments. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1706.92s)]
*  Now, this would be cases like the death of George Floyd [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1707.8s)]
*  in Minneapolis and that of Breonna Taylor in Louisville. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1710.3600000000001s)]
*  Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg welcomed the news. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1713.44s)]
*  Let's hear his comments. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1717.0s)]
*  We did not oppose DOJ's motion to dismiss today [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1718.72s)]
*  because we see the writing on the wall [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1721.68s)]
*  and it's time to move forward. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1724.1200000000001s)]
*  We can't afford any more delays. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1725.64s)]
*  There's no point in delaying the inevitable. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1727.88s)]
*  Let's focus on those reforms and improvements, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1730.1200000000001s)]
*  and that's why we did not object. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1732.64s)]
*  So, of course, you know, on Monday, May 25th, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1734.3200000000002s)]
*  will be the fifth anniversary or mark the fifth year [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1737.24s)]
*  that in remembrance of the death of George Floyd. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1740.48s)]
*  So the DOJ said it will also be ending investigations [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1743.88s)]
*  into other departments, including in Phoenix, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1748.76s)]
*  Trenton, New Jersey, Memphis, Tennessee, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1750.5600000000002s)]
*  Mount Vernon, New York, Oklahoma City, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1753.56s)]
*  and Louisiana State Police. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1755.84s)]
*  I wonder what are the reforms and initiatives? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1759.04s)]
*  You know, it's not like the George Floyd Policing Act [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1761.44s)]
*  was ever passed, so like when he, I'm all for, you know, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1763.28s)]
*  moving on if justice has been served, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1767.04s)]
*  if we have weeded the wrong people out of the system [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1770.44s)]
*  and if there is actual reforms and initiatives. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1773.76s)]
*  But what are the reforms and initiatives? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1777.1599999999999s)]
*  That's not probably a blanket answer, you know? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1779.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure that's gonna be case by case [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1781.3999999999999s)]
*  depending on the state and local police departments [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1782.96s)]
*  and those municipalities. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1786.92s)]
*  So some probably better than others, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1788.2s)]
*  but to your point, there is no blanket answer for that. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1791.1200000000001s)]
*  In other news, President Trump is again weighing in [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1796.2s)]
*  on the Department of Justice investigation [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1798.96s)]
*  into New York Democratic Attorney General. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1801.08s)]
*  At the Oval Office yesterday, Trump said Letitia James [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1804.48s)]
*  committed major fraud [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1807.24s)]
*  with her real estate transactions years ago. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1808.48s)]
*  Let's take a listen to President Trump [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1810.76s)]
*  in regards to that. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1812.24s)]
*  She signed in Virginia, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1813.32s)]
*  yet she said she lived in Virginia, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1814.92s)]
*  yet she's the New York State Attorney General. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1816.84s)]
*  She did that for tax reasons, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1819.92s)]
*  so she could take advantage of taxes. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1821.84s)]
*  It's major fraud, mortgage documents, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1823.96s)]
*  and fraudulent everything. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1826.68s)]
*  So Attorney General James has denied the allegations [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1829.04s)]
*  and claims it's only retribution for the many cases [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1831.8799999999999s)]
*  that she's brought against Trump. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1834.76s)]
*  The FBI has confirmed it's working with the DOJ [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1836.72s)]
*  on James' case. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1839.44s)]
*  And- [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1841.1200000000001s)]
*  We do know that Tis James is absolutely correct, right? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1841.96s)]
*  This is just retaliation for the charges [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1844.48s)]
*  that Tis James brought against Donald Trump. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1846.92s)]
*  Like Donald Trump has a list, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1849.24s)]
*  and Tis James is high on that list, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  as I'm sure Alvin Bragg is. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1852.52s)]
*  Alvin Bragg been very quiet, probably rightfully so, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1853.8000000000002s)]
*  but we do know this is retaliation. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1857.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and he said that. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1859.8000000000002s)]
*  He said that he would be coming after her [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1860.64s)]
*  if he was reelected. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1862.44s)]
*  So- Yup. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1864.2s)]
*  is facing up to 16 years in prison [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1867.28s)]
*  on two assault charges in that chaotic incident [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1869.52s)]
*  at the Newark ICE Detention Center earlier this month. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1872.36s)]
*  Now the Democrat is accused of assaulting federal agents [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1875.04s)]
*  as they move to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1877.56s)]
*  at a protest outside Delaney Hall on May 9th. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1881.36s)]
*  Now she spoke to MSNBC, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1884.4s)]
*  and here's what she had to say in regards to that incident. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1886.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think, one, this is political intimidation [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1889.2s)]
*  from the Trump administration. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1891.88s)]
*  I mean, me being charged is absurd, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1893.6s)]
*  especially when I'm just there to do my job. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1896.4s)]
*  The confusion and the chaos that you see [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1899.1200000000001s)]
*  was caused by ICE officials and Homeland Security. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1902.1200000000001s)]
*  They created this unnecessary situation [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1905.64s)]
*  by arresting the mayor. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1907.92s)]
*  And of course, she's referencing Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1909.4s)]
*  not to be confused with New York, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1912.88s)]
*  those who aren't in that area. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1914.3200000000002s)]
*  Now she appeared virtually for a 15-minute hearing [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1916.4s)]
*  on Wednesday and was released on her own recognizance. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1918.8400000000001s)]
*  She did not enter a plea. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1921.44s)]
*  The feds charged McIver the same day [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1922.88s)]
*  they dropped trespassing charges against Mayor Baraka. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1925.16s)]
*  Now President Trump weighed in on those charges [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1928.16s)]
*  against the Congresswoman. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1930.72s)]
*  Let's take a listen to his comments. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1931.8400000000001s)]
*  That woman was out of control. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1933.76s)]
*  She was shoving federal agents. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1935.3600000000001s)]
*  She was out of control. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1937.0400000000002s)]
*  The days of that crap are over in this country. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1938.6000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna have long order. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1941.3600000000001s)]
*  I watched that video. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1943.24s)]
*  I didn't see her assault anybody. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1944.16s)]
*  I didn't see her look out of control [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1945.5600000000002s)]
*  in no way, shape, or form. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1946.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1948.0400000000002s)]
*  She was definitely in between the agents and the mayor, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1948.88s)]
*  but they still got to the mayor. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1953.44s)]
*  I didn't see anything. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1955.72s)]
*  I saw them pushing her around. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1956.5600000000002s)]
*  Right, that's essentially what everybody else is saying, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1957.4s)]
*  Baraka and as well as McIver. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1959.5200000000002s)]
*  Now meanwhile, your good girl, Nancy Mace, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1962.16s)]
*  she's filing a resolution to expel Congresswoman [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1965.3600000000001s)]
*  LaMonica McIver. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1968.96s)]
*  Now Mace said the House has set a precedent [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1969.96s)]
*  for expelling members charged, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1972.0400000000002s)]
*  but not yet convicted of serious criminal offenses. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1974.0800000000002s)]
*  And she added, the public deserves to know [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1977.1200000000001s)]
*  that criminal conduct in the halls of Congress [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1979.68s)]
*  has consequences. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1983.0s)]
*  We will see what happens with Congresswoman LaMonica McIver. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1984.1999999999998s)]
*  I read something that said that what Nancy Mace filed [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1987.28s)]
*  is a long shot, but I don't know. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1990.08s)]
*  I feel like the way that people are weaponizing [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1993.08s)]
*  their power and their ability right now, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1995.2399999999998s)]
*  is there an end to this? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=1999.2399999999998s)]
*  What is the balance? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2001.0s)]
*  Because it's only gonna get worse. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2002.32s)]
*  There is no balance. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2003.84s)]
*  The scales are tipped right now in Republican favor. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2004.6799999999998s)]
*  Because the minute they can get you about it here, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2006.9199999999998s)]
*  they do it, and then if you fight back, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2008.7199999999998s)]
*  if you push back, now you insane or whatever Trump said. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2010.7199999999998s)]
*  I highly disagree with what Nancy Mace is doing. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2013.56s)]
*  And I saw her say repeatedly yesterday [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2016.4s)]
*  that nobody is above the law. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2018.4s)]
*  Yes, there is people that are above the law. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2020.6s)]
*  President Donald J. Trump is above the law. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2023.32s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2026.1200000000001s)]
*  There's no like, we talk about it every day, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2026.96s)]
*  but then what happened? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2029.32s)]
*  I mean, there's no consistency [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  because of what Morgan just said. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2031.28s)]
*  The balance of power, the scales have been tipped. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2033.0s)]
*  The scales have been very tipped. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2036.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2037.0s)]
*  And very much in favor for the Republican party. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2037.84s)]
*  Unless the Democratic party galvanizes [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2039.6s)]
*  and organizes in a way that puts everyone on the same page, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2043.48s)]
*  then I don't see it letting up anytime soon. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2046.88s)]
*  Especially being that we're only what? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2049.56s)]
*  A few months into the four year term. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2051.64s)]

*  Some of it is just, I'm able to just get it out [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2255.2400000000002s)]
*  because I remembered most of it. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2258.0s)]
*  And I had to call on my siblings [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2260.6000000000004s)]
*  to kind of fill in the gaps, but it's me. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2262.76s)]

*  So was it therapeutic at all to do it? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2271.24s)]
*  No, it was just natural. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2273.52s)]

*  with the accolades. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2284.84s)]
*  It's like the accolades are intertwined [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2285.96s)]
*  and everybody's accolades won't be like Olympian [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2288.56s)]
*  and national champions, but on a certain level, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2292.52s)]
*  like if you graduate high school, it's relatable. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2296.0s)]
*  If you graduate college, it's relatable. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2297.24s)]
*  If you can pull yourself out of the projects of any city, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2299.36s)]
*  it's relatable. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2303.12s)]
*  And there's no wrong path. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2305.0s)]
*  Like there's no, like you can get off, tilted, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2306.96s)]

*  Like I'm only giving what other people are giving me, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2323.24s)]
*  the feedback they're giving me. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2327.12s)]
*  And it's cool to hear people just relate to the book. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2328.8399999999997s)]

*  What you think happens in the projects. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2355.8799999999997s)]

*  crying, like bad things. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2360.0s)]

*  of giving me the scars I needed, the chinks in the armor, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2364.56s)]

*  Like there was unity in the projects. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2370.08s)]
*  There was discipline in the projects. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2373.24s)]
*  There was manicured lawns. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2376.04s)]
*  There was my block I grew up, never had trash in it. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2377.7999999999997s)]

*  to just be able to coach every day, like coach young people, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2406.08s)]

*  Like it really hurt me. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2447.92s)]
*  And I remembered it so vividly that for him to deny me that, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2449.04s)]
*  because it was one of the first times, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2453.2s)]
*  but I'm 13, 14 years old. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2454.4s)]

*  take their child out of state? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2459.32s)]
*  Like I wasn't thinking about that. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2461.56s)]
*  I was solely thinking about basketball, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2462.72s)]
*  but it was one of the experiences that drove me. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2464.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't like my father for that. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2469.4799999999996s)]
*  Like I didn't like him for the parental decision [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2471.56s)]
*  that he made, but as I'm older now and reflecting on [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2475.04s)]
*  and writing the book, it is, I need conflict. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2479.3999999999996s)]
*  I know that about myself, that I need conflict. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2482.3999999999996s)]
*  Like everything can't be comfortable. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2484.56s)]
*  Like if I have 10 people supporting me here, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2486.8399999999997s)]
*  I need about 10 to 12 people that's hating. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2490.9199999999996s)]
*  Like I need it. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2494.0s)]
*  I mean, it helps me. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2495.2799999999997s)]
*  It drives you. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2496.52s)]
*  It drives me. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2497.36s)]
*  Like it drives me. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2498.2000000000003s)]
*  That's why you said I don't have a critic yet. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2499.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm waiting for a critic to put a book right now. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2501.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2503.32s)]
*  So it's that, it's the ability. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2504.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, you know, we lost at UConn this year. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2506.6s)]
*  Like, you know, the critics are saying I can't coach. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2509.6s)]
*  I didn't understand that. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2512.92s)]
*  That pissed me off so bad. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2513.76s)]
*  I'm like, right. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2514.92s)]
*  That's what they say, but I'm like, okay, well, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2515.76s)]
*  but again, everything that I've needed in my life, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2517.92s)]
*  you know, failure, success happens to me. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2520.96s)]
*  It's in the critics. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2523.56s)]
*  It's uncommon. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2524.48s)]
*  Like, but I know our loss this year will somehow help us. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2525.36s)]
*  It will. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2529.88s)]
*  I'm not just relying on it helping us. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2530.96s)]
*  I'm going to put action to it. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2534.32s)]
*  So it means something. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2536.32s)]
*  I loved when you said that in a post-game conference. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2538.32s)]
*  You was like, I hope that they're crying. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2540.36s)]
*  I hope that my players are crying. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2542.36s)]
*  I hope that it hurts. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2543.72s)]
*  Cause that'll make them be better next year. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2544.92s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the most growth takes place [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2546.76s)]
*  when you're uncomfortable. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2549.68s)]
*  The most. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2551.08s)]
*  If you're comfortable all the time. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2551.92s)]
*  And I've said this as well. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2553.44s)]
*  Like parents really don't want their kids [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2555.04s)]
*  to feel what they felt like pain. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2558.56s)]
*  And I'm like, I want them to feel a little pain. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2561.28s)]
*  I want them to hurt. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2563.4s)]
*  I want them to be uncomfortable. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2564.2400000000002s)]
*  And I love them enough to allow them to sit in that space. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2565.64s)]
*  Because not for long, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2569.28s)]
*  but they need to fight their way out of it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2570.4s)]
*  Cause nothing's going to be given to them. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2573.08s)]
*  I don't like that place. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2574.76s)]
*  I don't like to feel that. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2576.08s)]
*  So I fight like hell to try to not feel that by prepping, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2577.44s)]
*  by doing everything I need to do to not feel that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2581.8s)]
*  It's almost like when you grow up in the projects [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2584.6400000000003s)]
*  and you grow up in poverty, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2587.2000000000003s)]
*  you don't want that anymore. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2589.28s)]
*  Like you don't want that. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2590.5600000000004s)]
*  Once you've lived and you've, you know, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2591.4s)]
*  earned a certain keep, you want to keep that [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2593.76s)]
*  because you want to change generations in your family. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2596.8s)]
*  And I hope I'm able to do that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2600.6400000000003s)]
*  We're still kicking it with Dawn Stanley, Charlamagne. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2602.6400000000003s)]
*  You seem like you've always been a natural born leader. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2604.88s)]
*  Like throughout your whole life, even when you were the child. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2609.0s)]
*  It made me wonder if coaching never entered your life, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2611.24s)]
*  where do you think your leadership [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2613.7999999999997s)]
*  would have shown up instead? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2615.0s)]
*  Oh man, that's a hard question. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2616.3999999999996s)]
*  Like I'm competitive. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2618.0s)]
*  I probably would have been a losing gambler. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2619.68s)]
*  But trying like heck, like trying like heck. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2622.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2627.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I do, I love kids. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2628.4399999999996s)]
*  So my work would have been with kids. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2630.8799999999997s)]
*  And I'm glad that coaching found me. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2633.4799999999996s)]
*  Like I'm glad somebody saw something in me [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2636.24s)]
*  that I didn't see in myself. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2639.08s)]
*  I didn't see coaching. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2640.48s)]
*  I didn't want to coach at all. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2641.52s)]
*  And I don't know why, because I had great coaches. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2643.68s)]
*  I had great people in my life that, that challenged me, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2645.52s)]
*  that were good at it. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2648.84s)]
*  But when I, when I had coaching friends, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2650.36s)]
*  the only thing they talked about [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2653.28s)]
*  were their teams and basketball. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2654.4s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, this is what I do every day. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2656.72s)]
*  I do this every day. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2658.68s)]
*  Why would I want to talk about it every day? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2659.96s)]
*  Why would I want my life consumed with it? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2661.88s)]
*  And here I am 25 years later, like loving it. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2664.56s)]
*  I guess I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2668.24s)]
*  And when you, when you're able to live out your passion, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2671.0s)]
*  it's the most beautiful, liberating [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2673.3599999999997s)]
*  and incredible experience. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2675.4399999999996s)]
*  Like I know my players really get something [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2676.9199999999996s)]
*  out of our relationship. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2680.04s)]
*  They do, they get, they build character, they navigate life. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2681.6s)]
*  But for me is I'm overjoyed when they graduate. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2685.24s)]
*  I'm overjoyed on draft night. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2688.56s)]
*  I'm overjoyed when they're able to see their hard work [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2690.3199999999997s)]
*  produce what they want. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2695.0s)]
*  Like even if they don't make it to the league, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2696.36s)]
*  they're equipped with being successful with anything. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2698.32s)]
*  Like seriously, that does something to my heart [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2701.76s)]
*  when young people were able to get what they're supposed to. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2704.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, you talked about your players. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2707.08s)]
*  You got a lot of success stories from your time coaching [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2708.32s)]
*  at the University of South Carolina, but in the book, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2710.48s)]
*  you make it no secret that Asia Wilson is your favorite. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2712.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, I mean, here's why. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2715.0s)]
*  And I don't, I've coached a lot of great players. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2716.96s)]
*  Like Asia was the very first player [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2720.1200000000003s)]
*  that was the number one player in the country [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2722.88s)]
*  to decide she wanted to come play for us. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2725.8s)]
*  And I know it was in her backyard. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2728.2400000000002s)]
*  And we didn't look like a national championship team. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2729.96s)]
*  Like we never won a national, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2733.36s)]
*  we had never been to the final four. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2734.96s)]
*  So for her to trust us with that part of her career [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2737.04s)]
*  meant that she believed in us. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2741.88s)]
*  She trusted us. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2743.6400000000003s)]
*  She knew that we were gonna get her to where she needed [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2745.0s)]
*  to go as far as still being the number one draft pick. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2749.4s)]
*  Like four years later. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2753.0800000000004s)]
*  Like when someone, and it wasn't just her, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2754.68s)]
*  it was her entire family believed in it. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2757.3599999999997s)]
*  And it took some at times them thinking, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2760.3999999999996s)]
*  did we make the right decision? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2765.12s)]
*  Because she started her first game [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2766.7999999999997s)]
*  and then she was terrible, like scrub like, right? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2769.16s)]
*  Scrub like is pretty far, that's far. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2773.3199999999997s)]
*  So I was like, I gotta take you out of the starting lineup. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2776.7599999999998s)]
*  But I didn't even tell her that. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2780.2s)]
*  I told her parents first. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2781.64s)]
*  And her mom, Eva was like, you sure? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2783.32s)]
*  I'm like, you're gonna have to trust me on this one. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2787.0s)]
*  Like you just gonna have to trust me. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2789.36s)]
*  And she was like, all right. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2791.1200000000003s)]
*  But at the end of her freshman year, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2792.56s)]
*  she was national rookie of the year. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2794.8s)]
*  She was first team all SEC. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2796.4s)]
*  She was rookie of the year in the SEC. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2798.88s)]
*  Like she got all the accolades coming off the bench. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2801.2000000000003s)]
*  And when someone as a coach and leader and mentor, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2804.0s)]
*  young people believe in you like they really do. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2808.1200000000003s)]
*  When that's reciprocated, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2811.32s)]
*  because I believed that I knew that she was gonna be [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2813.48s)]
*  the one that takes us to that next level. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2815.96s)]
*  When you're able to have the same synergy, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2818.04s)]
*  Asia was hell to deal with. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2821.44s)]
*  Because she's young, like she went to private school [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2824.7200000000003s)]
*  for like 12 years. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2827.7200000000003s)]
*  All of her schooling was private school. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2829.2000000000003s)]
*  So she needed to be roughened up a little bit [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2831.6000000000004s)]
*  to get her ready for what she faces. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2835.0s)]
*  Like she faces the critics right now, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2836.76s)]
*  but I know she can handle them [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2839.24s)]
*  because we took her through all of that. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2840.64s)]
*  Like she had dyslexia, right? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2843.04s)]
*  Throughout her college career. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2845.7599999999998s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, you're gonna read in front of the team. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2847.64s)]
*  Every time we have a game, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2850.7599999999998s)]
*  because we have like a scripture reading [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2851.6s)]
*  and an inspirational reading before every pregame meal. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2854.2s)]
*  And there's somebody that has to read it. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2858.0s)]
*  So I was like, you're gonna read that. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2860.3199999999997s)]
*  It took her senior year. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2861.7999999999997s)]
*  Couldn't do it the first, second, third. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2863.9599999999996s)]
*  Her senior year, she read out loud. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2865.7599999999998s)]
*  She had fun with it. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2868.4799999999996s)]
*  She was like, y'all, this is alone. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2869.3199999999997s)]
*  Y'all gonna have to bear with me. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2870.4799999999996s)]
*  Like it was that kind of liberation. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2871.9599999999996s)]
*  So when she gave her entire self to me, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2875.0s)]
*  the good, the bad, the ugly, entire, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2878.3999999999996s)]
*  that's why I just have a really strong [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2881.52s)]
*  like relationship with her. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2884.52s)]
*  Like she could tell me anything. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2886.24s)]
*  Like I'm non-judgmental. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2887.68s)]
*  Like young people won't wanna tell you everything [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2889.9599999999996s)]
*  because they think you're gonna judge them. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2892.64s)]
*  I don't judge. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2894.12s)]
*  There's nothing that any one of my current, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2895.3999999999996s)]
*  former, future players can tell me that's gonna rock me [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2897.7999999999997s)]
*  that I haven't seen. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2901.3199999999997s)]
*  Like everybody's been through, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2902.24s)]
*  like there's no new problems. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2903.6s)]
*  It's the same old recycle problems. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2905.6s)]
*  So just give it here. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2907.68s)]
*  So you're not dealing with it longer than you need to. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2909.3599999999997s)]
*  It's interesting, right? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2911.9199999999996s)]
*  Because I was watching you, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2912.7599999999998s)]
*  you did Good Morning America, the View, Kobe, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2913.6s)]
*  all of that stuff like that. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2915.3599999999997s)]
*  So you was working, but I still know [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2916.2799999999997s)]
*  you still the coach at the University of South Carolina. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2917.9199999999996s)]
*  But I was like, oh, you know what? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2920.6s)]
*  She'll be fine. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2922.04s)]
*  You used to play ball and coach at the same time, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2922.86s)]
*  which I found out about in the book. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2925.6200000000003s)]
*  That was insane. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2926.88s)]
*  Six years. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2928.46s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2929.3s)]
*  Six years. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2930.38s)]
*  I mean, when I got into coaching, I was like in my prime. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2931.2200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, the AD at the time, he kept asking me, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2934.26s)]
*  like he was persistent. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2939.46s)]
*  Like I'm like, no, no, I'm not interested. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2940.42s)]
*  I'm playing in the WNBA. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2943.02s)]
*  And then he just kept asking. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2945.58s)]
*  And then I ended up having to go meet with him [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2946.86s)]
*  because the Final Four was in Philly, from Philly. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2949.98s)]
*  He knew I was gonna be there. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2952.22s)]
*  So I went and sat down with him and he asked me two questions. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2953.66s)]
*  He was like, can you lead? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2957.2999999999997s)]
*  Did you do your research? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2959.02s)]
*  Like did you, right? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2960.7s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I basically was the captain [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2962.02s)]
*  on every team that I played on, right? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2964.7799999999997s)]
*  And then he was like, can you turn [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2966.8599999999997s)]
*  Temple Women's Basketball program around? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2968.4599999999996s)]
*  And I was like, oh, is that a challenge? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2970.62s)]
*  Like, is that really a challenge? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2973.12s)]
*  Because I'm drawing the challenges [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2974.8999999999996s)]
*  and I never answered the question. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2976.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't even think I answered the question. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2977.74s)]
*  He was like, hey, can you just come down the hall [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2979.22s)]
*  and meet some people? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2982.06s)]
*  So I was like, okay, I'm here. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2983.46s)]
*  He took me in this conference room, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2984.86s)]
*  sat me at the head of the table, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2986.54s)]
*  and there were like 10 to 12 people [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2988.42s)]
*  sitting around this table. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2990.22s)]
*  And they're asking me questions like, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2991.8199999999997s)]
*  where do you see yourself in five years? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2993.06s)]
*  I'm like playing in the WNBA. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2994.66s)]
*  And they were like, do you ever see yourself coaching? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2996.62s)]
*  And I'm like, no. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=2999.2599999999998s)]
*  Like y'all, they were interviewing me. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3000.5s)]
*  I was on a job interview. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3002.34s)]
*  And I didn't know it. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3003.94s)]
*  Because all my job interviews were tryouts, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3004.9s)]
*  like basketball, like physical tryouts. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3007.8199999999997s)]
*  Needless to say, I took the job. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3010.26s)]
*  Two weeks later, they just agreed to allow me [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3012.3s)]
*  to continue to play and coach. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3015.6200000000003s)]
*  So I was in like basketball utopia [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3017.5400000000004s)]
*  because I was coaching [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3020.1800000000003s)]
*  and I'm actually still able to express myself on the court. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3022.3s)]
*  Because I wasn't ready to hang up my shoes. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3026.5400000000004s)]
*  I was still very much a player. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3028.82s)]
*  And I think that allowed me to play [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3032.5400000000004s)]
*  a little bit longer than I wanted to. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3034.82s)]
*  And that allowed me to keep staying fresh [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3036.86s)]
*  with what was up with teaching young people. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3040.36s)]
*  Because they were more enthralled with me playing [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3043.0s)]
*  because that's what they wanted. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3046.28s)]
*  Like I was living their dream, right? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3047.2000000000003s)]
*  Before their very eyes. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3049.4s)]
*  And I think it just helped me be a better coach, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3050.76s)]
*  be a more understanding coach. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3055.32s)]
*  Because I was a player receiving information from a coach. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3057.6000000000004s)]
*  And then it just helped the dynamics of what I was doing. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3061.88s)]
*  We're still kicking in with Dawn Stanley, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3065.96s)]
*  Uncommon Favor is out right now. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3068.16s)]
*  Basketball North Philly, my mother and the life lessons [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3070.16s)]
*  I learned from all three. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3072.72s)]
*  Now I wanted to ask about your father, right? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3074.3199999999997s)]
*  You mentioned your father earlier. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3076.08s)]
*  And you said your relationship wasn't that great. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3077.7999999999997s)]
*  What you said it got better over the years. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3079.7999999999997s)]
*  Do you understand some of the things that your father [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3082.0s)]
*  was trying to implement in you as a young girl? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3083.7999999999997s)]
*  Because they said that your father looked at women's [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3085.6s)]
*  basketball and felt there wasn't too many opportunities [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3087.3199999999997s)]
*  and didn't know if you could sustain at that time. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3089.92s)]
*  And do you wish that you kind of put yourself [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3093.24s)]
*  in his mentality back then as a child? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3096.14s)]
*  Because even with the name of the book, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3097.66s)]
*  it says basketball North Philly, my mother, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3098.62s)]
*  but not my father. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3100.94s)]
*  Explain that a little bit. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3102.54s)]
*  Good catch. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3103.38s)]
*  But not my father. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3104.2s)]
*  Good catch. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3105.04s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3105.88s)]
*  Good catch. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3106.72s)]
*  You know, I think even the one family members [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3107.54s)]
*  that are closest to you, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3112.18s)]
*  yes, I should have had a much more mature outlook [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3114.7s)]
*  on that relationship. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3120.52s)]
*  Now that you can reflect on it now that you can see, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3122.58s)]
*  because I held that. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3124.78s)]
*  And I, you know, if you can hear that, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3126.38s)]
*  I still hold that instance. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3128.1800000000003s)]
*  But when you're coaching, right? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3130.3s)]
*  You come into a situation where you hurt a player. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3133.1400000000003s)]
*  Like you hurt that player that was like [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3136.0600000000004s)]
*  probably 12 years ago. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3138.6600000000003s)]
*  I hurt that player. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3139.8s)]
*  Like it drives me to not hurt other players. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3140.86s)]
*  And I wasn't mature enough or savvy enough [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3144.0800000000004s)]
*  to handle that at 12 or 13. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3146.7400000000002s)]
*  So I do think it's helped me be a better coach. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3149.1400000000003s)]
*  It helps me be a better person to really, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3153.34s)]
*  like again, I didn't talk about things. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3156.9s)]
*  I held that. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3159.02s)]
*  My father probably didn't, probably doesn't. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3159.86s)]
*  He's been dead and gone since 2001. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3161.9s)]
*  Like I don't even think he really knew how much that hurt me. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3166.82s)]
*  But also use that to navigate the no's. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3170.9s)]
*  Like I handle no's a lot better because of that. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3174.94s)]
*  I love the respect the power of habits chapter. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3178.6400000000003s)]
*  And in that chapter, you speak extremely highly [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3181.78s)]
*  of South Carolina's own Malaysia for a while. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3184.94s)]
*  And you even refer to her as a younger, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3187.34s)]
*  savvier version of you. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3189.26s)]
*  You say, and this is a quote, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3190.5400000000004s)]
*  I heard from so many adults who gave their own parents hell [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3191.78s)]
*  only to see their teenagers return the favor. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3194.7000000000003s)]
*  Now it's my turn in the barrel. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3197.1000000000004s)]
*  So when I see you had, when I read that and I was like, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3198.6200000000003s)]
*  and she had so much love for Malaysia. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3201.1000000000004s)]
*  What was your initial reaction [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3202.7400000000002s)]
*  when she decided to enter the portal? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3204.5s)]
*  And was it surprising to you? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3206.1400000000003s)]
*  Surprising? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3208.5s)]
*  No. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3209.34s)]
*  I think, you know, being in this space, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3210.16s)]
*  you become to expect the unexpected, right? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3212.0s)]
*  I still have much love for Malaysia. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3215.64s)]
*  Like much love. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3217.8799999999997s)]
*  Like I want her happy. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3218.72s)]
*  She and her mom came in. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3219.54s)]
*  She said, I think I'm going to get into the transfer portal. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3220.72s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, well you think or you know? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3223.6s)]
*  And she said, I know. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3225.92s)]
*  And I said, well, I only want you happy. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3227.54s)]
*  Like I really do only want our players happy. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3229.7599999999998s)]
*  Whether that's with us or somewhere else, just be happy. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3231.92s)]
*  I told her, don't look back. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3236.24s)]
*  I know it's probably going to be hard [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3237.44s)]
*  to not look back to see, you know, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3239.56s)]
*  you leaving your hometown and all that. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3241.92s)]
*  I said, don't look back. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3243.6s)]
*  Like you made this decision, just go forward with it. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3244.68s)]
*  And don't look back. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3248.4s)]
*  You're always going to be a Gamecock. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3250.52s)]
*  You're always going to be welcomed here. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3251.96s)]
*  I wish her the best. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3253.7599999999998s)]
*  And when I say that, people probably think, oh, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3255.12s)]
*  but I do. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3257.6s)]
*  Like I really do. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3258.44s)]
*  Like, cause I am, what's for us is for us. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3260.0s)]
*  What's not is what's not. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3263.4s)]
*  Let's keep moving. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3265.44s)]
*  I don't stay in despair. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3266.28s)]
*  I don't stay in those spaces for very long. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3267.54s)]
*  I'm like, okay, we got to get recruiting. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3270.62s)]
*  We got to get back into this portal [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3272.66s)]
*  to see who we can get to help us. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3274.54s)]
*  I think she's going to have a promising career. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3276.48s)]
*  I do think she's a generational talent that will never leave. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3279.22s)]
*  Like she does things on the basketball court [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3282.74s)]
*  that I've never seen a woman do. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3284.7s)]
*  And she's, she'll continue to do that. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3287.16s)]
*  And we'll continue to be happy for her, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3289.5s)]
*  except the one or two times that we have to play them. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3292.36s)]
*  Like it's on. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3295.1s)]
*  Like it's just, she's going to be super competitive [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3296.34s)]
*  against us. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3298.58s)]
*  We're going to, we're going to want to win. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3299.42s)]
*  And it's going to be a pride thing that comes [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3300.86s)]
*  with just being a competitor. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3303.26s)]
*  And we got much love for her and her family. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3305.42s)]
*  Now this, this has nothing to do with the book, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3307.9s)]
*  but I wanted to ask this. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3309.38s)]
*  We talking about players, you know, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3310.2200000000003s)]
*  WNBA has taken a huge jump in the last couple of years [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3311.9s)]
*  and I love it. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3315.02s)]
*  My daughters love it. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3315.86s)]
*  My sons love it. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3316.6800000000003s)]
*  What do you think what's going on in the WNBA [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3317.52s)]
*  where it seems like they're pitting, you know, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3319.1800000000003s)]
*  Caitlin Clark against Angel Reese, right? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3321.46s)]
*  Kind of what they did in NBA back in the day [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3324.34s)]
*  but it was more teams, right? [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3326.86s)]
*  I guess not, maybe not teams. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3327.7s)]
*  It was Magic versus Bird, this one versus that one. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3328.62s)]
*  But this one, it just seems like it seems very personable. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3330.46s)]
*  So what are your thoughts? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3333.2999999999997s)]
*  Like even the other day with that foul [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3334.14s)]
*  and they called it a flagrant foul. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3335.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't necessarily agree, but what are your thoughts on it? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3337.22s)]
*  Well, I think the officiating has a hard job. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3339.7s)]
*  That's one. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3342.7799999999997s)]
*  The decipher whether or not that's a flagrant one [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3343.74s)]
*  or not hard job. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3345.94s)]
*  And I do think they understand the dynamics [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3347.2599999999998s)]
*  of Angel and Caitlin. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3350.2599999999998s)]
*  I do. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3352.14s)]
*  I think it's great for our game. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3353.04s)]
*  Yeah, like it's a sport. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3355.26s)]
*  Treat us like a sport. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3357.02s)]
*  Don't treat us anything other than being a sport. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3358.42s)]
*  It happens in every sport, soccer, basketball, football. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3361.7s)]
*  It happens in every sport. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3365.42s)]
*  So let it be. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3366.9s)]
*  I'm gonna take the lead of Angel and Caitlin. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3367.98s)]
*  And that lead is, they said it was a foul. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3371.58s)]
*  The officials got it right. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3374.9s)]
*  We're moving on. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3376.7s)]
*  That's what I'm gonna take their lead. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3377.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3379.5s)]
*  I think it pulls people in. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3380.34s)]
*  I do think there are new fans that haven't watched our game [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3382.74s)]
*  and they really don't know. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3386.98s)]
*  So they only singly focused on Caitlin. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3389.1s)]
*  That one part, right? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3391.8599999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3392.7s)]
*  So when you're that, and that's their idol. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3393.54s)]
*  That's who attracts them. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3395.54s)]
*  But I just hope that they'll open their eyes [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3398.66s)]
*  to the rest of the talent that is there. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3402.54s)]
*  Like the product is incredible. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3405.14s)]
*  And it's in high demand. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3408.8199999999997s)]
*  We played Caitlin in the national championship [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3410.8999999999996s)]
*  last year, right? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3413.54s)]
*  20 million, it topped off at, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3414.8599999999997s)]
*  whatever it topped off at the most. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3417.14s)]
*  I know they saw us. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3419.1s)]
*  Like I know they saw us. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3420.42s)]
*  I know they saw us have an undefeated season. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3421.94s)]
*  I know they saw Camila Cardoza. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3424.5s)]
*  I know they saw Ashlyn Watts. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3426.8999999999996s)]
*  I know they saw Tessa Johnson have an incredible career [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3428.3799999999997s)]
*  or day. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3432.8199999999997s)]
*  I know they saw Malaysia do some incredible things. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3433.66s)]
*  So open your eyes up to seeing outside of Caitlin. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3436.78s)]
*  Well, not even outside, included, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3440.78s)]
*  cause she's a part of it all. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3442.5s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to the next time they play too. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3444.82s)]
*  I'm gonna be glued in. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3448.9s)]
*  Just like everybody else, yes. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3450.02s)]
*  I wanna go back to that chapter, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3451.62s)]
*  respect the power of habits, right? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3453.9s)]
*  When you talk about Malaysia, it is with such reverence. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3455.86s)]
*  How do you balance disappointment as a coach [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3457.7s)]
*  with support for somebody like her [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3459.94s)]
*  who just wanted to make a decision for herself? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3461.42s)]
*  If a young person is gonna speak on [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3463.86s)]
*  what they deem is good for them, that's half the battle. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3466.86s)]
*  Like half the battle is to be able to speak up. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3470.94s)]
*  And you know how hard it was for her to do that? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3473.5s)]
*  Like really hard, really hard. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3475.6200000000003s)]
*  So I understand that dynamics of her decision-making. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3477.7400000000002s)]
*  And then it's like, okay, well, what do you do with it? [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3481.86s)]
*  Like if she was my player and there was a chance for her [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3484.3s)]
*  to wanna come back, or if she decided that this is that, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3488.2200000000003s)]
*  that's not what she wanted to do. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3491.7400000000002s)]
*  I was gonna talk to her about why? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3493.3799999999997s)]
*  Why did it come to that? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3495.8599999999997s)]
*  What makes you think this isn't a place [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3497.54s)]
*  for whatever she said, we will go from there. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3499.9399999999996s)]
*  I thought Malaysia was getting better. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3503.2999999999997s)]
*  Like I really, I saw a whole lot of growth [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3506.22s)]
*  on and off the court to where, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3508.8599999999997s)]
*  unless she was gonna get the best of her now. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3511.4199999999996s)]
*  Like we went through the, you know, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3513.8599999999997s)]
*  we went through the hard part [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3515.22s)]
*  of just kinda smoothing some rough edges [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3517.18s)]
*  and getting her to create good habits. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3519.62s)]
*  I do think habits are the thing [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3523.0600000000004s)]
*  that allows you to elevate, right? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3525.34s)]
*  I do. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3528.2200000000003s)]
*  So I think what we've given her and what she's given us [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3529.1800000000003s)]
*  will allow her to have much better days, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3533.42s)]
*  much more consistent days than she had with us [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3536.7000000000003s)]
*  at her next stop. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3539.7400000000002s)]

*  Well, it's the latest. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3624.62s)]
*  On The Breakfast Club. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3625.74s)]
*  Talk to me! [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3627.02s)]
*  Now Charlamagne, in the last hour you asked me a question [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3628.5s)]
*  about Diddy, the alleged guns that they found, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3630.66s)]
*  or they found them, but that they're alleging are his, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3634.02s)]
*  they are 15's, and how that relates to the indictment. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3636.22s)]
*  So I found the exact answer to that. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3639.7s)]
*  So the special agent, Gerard Gannon, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3641.98s)]
*  that was talking about the AR-15's is talking about this [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3645.1s)]
*  because in the indictment, they are trying to say [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3647.3799999999997s)]
*  that Diddy himself allegedly rebranded firearms [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3649.74s)]
*  to intimidate others. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3653.74s)]
*  So it is to the gist of what I was mentioning to you, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3655.18s)]
*  but I wanted to make sure I answered that. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3657.02s)]
*  Now moving on, and other court things, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3658.46s)]
*  or trying to get back to court things. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3661.5s)]
*  Tory Lanez. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3662.9399999999996s)]
*  Tory Lanez has had the people up in arms [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3664.5s)]
*  these last couple of weeks. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3666.7s)]
*  After he was stabbed 14 times, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3667.86s)]
*  because there are now representatives [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3669.94s)]
*  and different people that are pushing for him to be released. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3672.46s)]
*  So there is a woman, her name is Rep Luna. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3675.38s)]
*  She is from Florida's Anna Paulina Luna, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3678.38s)]
*  a Florida's 13th district. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3681.1s)]
*  She is calling for Tory Lanez' freedom, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3682.86s)]
*  and she sat down with Chris Cuomo on News Nation [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3684.78s)]
*  and had a conversation about this. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3688.02s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3689.46s)]
*  This case was actually initially flagged for me [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3690.42s)]
*  by Amber Rose, and the reason why I took [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3692.46s)]
*  a particular interest in it is because of the fact [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3694.7000000000003s)]
*  that they actually had evidence that they presented [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3696.9s)]
*  to me in my office that actually disproved the conviction. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3698.94s)]
*  So as you stated earlier, that 0.01% of DNA, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3702.1s)]
*  they actually found four people's DNA on that firearm, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3705.26s)]
*  none of which was Tory's. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3708.34s)]
*  Not to mention there was zero fingerprints [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3709.6600000000003s)]
*  on the actual magazine, and also too, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3711.78s)]
*  as you said, 0.01% chance. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3714.26s)]
*  Also there's been ring footage that's been obtained [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3716.58s)]
*  that actually disproves the whole dance Megan. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3718.94s)]
*  I actually reached out today to Gavin Newsom's office, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3722.14s)]
*  and we are requesting an emergency meeting. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3725.34s)]
*  So Luna, who did it? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3727.46s)]
*  You know, Chris, that's not for me to weigh in, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3728.7000000000003s)]
*  and that's definitely for the judge and the jury, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3730.54s)]
*  but what I will tell you is based on the evidence [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3732.9s)]
*  that we have. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3735.46s)]
*  The evidence that we have says that he wasn't the guy. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3736.38s)]
*  What's the evidence they have now? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3740.1800000000003s)]
*  They said the ring camera? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3741.7000000000003s)]
*  She said the ring camera. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3742.54s)]
*  She said that she talked about the DNA, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3744.54s)]
*  that there were four people's DNA found on the gun. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3747.06s)]
*  People knew that, that's why I was inconclusive. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3750.98s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that when people talk about [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3753.26s)]
*  the whole DNA thing, they need to understand [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3755.02s)]
*  that inconclusive means that, yeah, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3756.46s)]
*  they weren't able to fully rule him, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3758.5400000000004s)]
*  I mean, they weren't able to fully say [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3760.38s)]
*  he 100% had the gun, but they weren't able [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3762.6200000000003s)]
*  to rule him out either. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3765.1400000000003s)]
*  So it doesn't make it that he didn't have it. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3766.2200000000003s)]
*  It leaves it open, it's inconclusive. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3768.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I don't remember them saying four people, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3770.6600000000003s)]
*  I just remember them saying it was a male and a female. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3771.94s)]
*  Yeah, she said a lot of things. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3773.6200000000003s)]
*  Even that ring camera thing, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3776.0600000000004s)]
*  they had an eyewitness that testified about, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3777.6200000000003s)]
*  you know, different things as well too. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3780.7000000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of things that you can debunk [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3782.5400000000004s)]
*  in what she's saying or throw information back [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3784.06s)]
*  at what she's saying, but I think overall, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3786.34s)]
*  a judge ruled that Tory Lane was guilty, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3788.54s)]
*  and until it is back in front of a judge [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3791.38s)]
*  and there's anything else that is said, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3793.34s)]
*  who are we to be making Meg Thee Stallion's life horrible [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3795.1s)]
*  because of what's happening? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3798.98s)]
*  Regardless of how you feel, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3800.06s)]
*  I think it should be left to a court. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3800.9s)]
*  Now, there's a TikToker online who said that just the- [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3802.82s)]
*  Oh, Lord. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3805.2599999999998s)]
*  Of what I just said. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3806.1s)]
*  Now look, so this TikToker, she went online [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3806.94s)]
*  and she's like, look, y'all out here arguing [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3809.14s)]
*  about this Tory Lane thing, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3811.06s)]
*  and she threw this at Tory's team, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3812.86s)]
*  she said, take it to a judge. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3814.38s)]
*  Don't bring it to us online, don't have press conferences, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3816.26s)]
*  take it to a judge. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3818.6600000000003s)]
*  It's that simple, and I said this earlier this week, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3819.58s)]
*  like, you know, we're acting like this didn't go [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3821.58s)]
*  through a court of law, like it was a due process. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3823.58s)]
*  It was weeks and weeks of testimony. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3826.1s)]
*  It was evidence that was presented. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3828.38s)]
*  I don't understand how all of that can happen, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3830.1800000000003s)]
*  but then one random person in a car says, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3832.9s)]
*  I overheard somebody say something, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3835.34s)]
*  and everybody just rushes to just, you know, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3837.58s)]
*  act like what happened in court isn't true. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3840.94s)]
*  I wasn't there, so I don't know what happened. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3843.38s)]
*  I'm just telling you, this is what played out in court. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3844.66s)]
*  And then he just saying, this is what he heard. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3846.46s)]
*  He just now said, this is what he heard. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3849.58s)]
*  And he heard all of this while the trial was going on. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3852.2599999999998s)]
*  Why didn't you say something then? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3854.7s)]
*  Right, well, okay, so SZA commented, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3857.3399999999997s)]
*  the reason why this TikToker's video [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3860.62s)]
*  is kind of everywhere right now is because SZA came in [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3861.8599999999997s)]
*  and commented in defense of Meg the Psy, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3864.3399999999997s)]
*  and she said the density in response to the video. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3866.5s)]
*  She said, I'm actually so shocked, and so is in all caps, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3868.98s)]
*  at the amount of people fully comfortable [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3871.86s)]
*  with bullying a woman that's proven to be a victim [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3873.38s)]
*  of assault, like out loud, where other people can see you. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3875.3s)]
*  Like you finna be stupid out loud, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3878.6600000000003s)]
*  and she capitalized out loud. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3880.58s)]
*  I just don't understand how all the evidence and testimony [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3883.6600000000003s)]
*  that happened in a court of law weighs less [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3885.94s)]
*  than just some guy who said I overheard her say X, Y, and Z. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3888.86s)]
*  I don't understand why people's brains work like that. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3893.42s)]
*  I'd rather listen to this person who said [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3896.26s)]
*  they overheard something, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3897.9s)]
*  but didn't feel like it was urgent enough to say it [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3899.74s)]
*  while the trial was happening. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3902.58s)]
*  But now he speaks out, and you just agree with him, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3904.3799999999997s)]
*  as opposed to everything you hear in court? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3908.2599999999998s)]
*  I'd rather you just shut up and not say nothing, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3910.3799999999997s)]
*  and not be on any side. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3912.7799999999997s)]
*  I just, it makes no sense. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3913.74s)]
*  It only makes sense online. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3915.54s)]
*  Could it be Tory got stabbed, and he's like, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3916.7799999999997s)]
*  you know what, this has gone too far. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3920.22s)]
*  Let me say what I heard four or five years ago. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3922.5s)]
*  But you should've said it while the trial was happening. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3925.54s)]
*  But that's what I'm saying though. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3928.2999999999997s)]
*  He's alleging that he was put in a bad position [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3929.2999999999997s)]
*  by his attorneys at that time, and he couldn't. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3931.42s)]
*  And who got this ring? [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3933.18s)]
*  Who else got the ring camera footage? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3934.1s)]
*  I'm not for sure. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3935.74s)]
*  I'm not fucking, people are just saying stuff. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3936.58s)]
*  Is this all? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3939.8599999999997s)]
*  It's all kinds, like, did people know where they was? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3940.7s)]
*  Like, where they was at, where this whole thing started? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3943.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they were outside of the party. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3947.18s)]
*  It was like 4.30 in the morning. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3949.8199999999997s)]
*  They were in the place. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3950.98s)]
*  I know, but whose house? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3951.8199999999997s)]
*  Is it out there, whose house it was? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3952.7799999999997s)]
*  And if that lady saw ring camera footage, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3954.8599999999997s)]
*  where is the footage? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3956.54s)]
*  Like, people just be throwing stuff online, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3958.6200000000003s)]
*  and folks just run towards it and gravitate towards it, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3960.82s)]
*  and repeat it and use it to justify how they feel. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3963.5800000000004s)]
*  Because apparently, like, they was at, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3966.1800000000003s)]
*  allegedly they were at a big celebrity's house. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3967.7400000000002s)]

*  and then they left, Kylie. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3972.26s)]
*  Look, I don't know. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3974.1800000000003s)]
*  I just, all I'm saying is that if Tory feels [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3975.02s)]
*  like he was wrong, he can take it to court, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3977.3s)]
*  that it's his right to do so. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3978.98s)]
*  But I think- [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3980.38s)]
*  How do you take it to court? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3981.2200000000003s)]

*  they write letters to the judges. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3985.94s)]
*  There's things that you can do to attempt [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3986.98s)]
*  to get a judge to reconsider. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3988.58s)]
*  Just do that. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3990.58s)]
*  But I think people's main thing is, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3991.54s)]
*  is like, until that's done, please, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3992.9s)]
*  let's back off of making a person's life miserable, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3994.7400000000002s)]
*  because all we got right now is what was ruled on, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=3997.78s)]
*  and we're gonna leave it there. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4000.26s)]
*  But speaking of people online and rulings, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4001.38s)]
*  why Meek insert himself in this Diddy stuff? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4003.7s)]
*  Yes, I just saw him the other day. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4006.14s)]
*  Y'all, stop talking about me. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4007.5s)]
*  Stop saying this. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4009.9s)]

*  I don't like how you said that. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4012.94s)]
*  He did not say, she did not say that. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4013.78s)]
*  That's what you just said. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4014.62s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4015.46s)]
*  No, not in Diddy, but in the Diddy stuff. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4016.5s)]
*  So he tweeted a couple days. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4018.7400000000002s)]
*  And Diddy don't get bended. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4019.9s)]

*  He did a bending, so ain't nobody inserting. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4022.26s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4023.9s)]
*  Meek tweeted just to put on public record. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4024.7400000000002s)]
*  No, he had tweeted something else before this. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4029.2200000000003s)]

*  he was talking about the little Rod guy or whatever, right? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4032.5s)]
*  But then he goes to clarify [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4035.1000000000004s)]
*  what he actually saw at Diddy parties. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4036.46s)]
*  He said, the craziest thing he's seen at a puff party [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4038.1000000000004s)]
*  is Coke vibes, and that's going on at all these parties. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4040.38s)]
*  I'm from North Philly. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4043.9s)]

*  not judging, but I see it different. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4047.8999999999996s)]
*  His original tweet said, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4050.2999999999997s)]
*  in the midst of Diddy on federal trial, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4051.14s)]
*  I want to bring back up that little Rod [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4054.1s)]
*  and his lawsuit was dropped. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4055.58s)]
*  He never said my name in these blogs, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4056.66s)]
*  amplified that whole agenda against me. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4058.4199999999996s)]
*  My culture don't believe it, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4060.7799999999997s)]
*  but it's an attack on my brand. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4061.94s)]
*  I want to get to the bottom of it. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4063.4199999999996s)]
*  So what happened? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4064.7s)]
*  Remember they brought Meek into it. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4066.1s)]
*  Remember they said the rapper from Philly, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4069.8199999999997s)]
*  originally in some of the civil lawsuits. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4071.46s)]
*  So Meek just volunteered this information. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4072.2999999999997s)]
*  This is not the only rapper from Philly. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4074.18s)]
*  You don't understand? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4077.18s)]
*  No, he just was on Twitter. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4078.02s)]
*  He took the Twitter stand. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4080.1s)]
*  I don't understand why. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4084.1s)]
*  I wouldn't want to keep bringing myself back up into this. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4085.94s)]
*  Nobody was talking about Meek in this situation. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4088.8599999999997s)]
*  Did anybody talk about Meek and Cohen? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4091.54s)]
*  No. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4093.2599999999998s)]

*  produced a handgun, and opened fire. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4231.379999999999s)]
*  The suspect identified his 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4233.98s)]
*  from Chicago, then entered the museum [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4237.219999999999s)]
*  and was detained by event security, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4239.62s)]
*  according to authorities. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4241.62s)]
*  Israel, identifying the victims as Yaron Leshinsky [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4243.139999999999s)]
*  and Sarah Lynn Milgram, a young couple [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4246.58s)]
*  who are about to become engaged. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4249.22s)]
*  The young man purchased a ring this week [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4251.42s)]
*  with the intention of proposing [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4254.42s)]
*  to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4256.78s)]
*  Now, this isn't political for me. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4259.58s)]
*  This is about humanity. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4261.14s)]
*  Okay, I know the Israeli versus Palestinian conflict [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4262.74s)]
*  is one of the most intense debates in the world today [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4265.42s)]
*  and has been for thousands of years. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4267.9s)]
*  I am fully aware that Elias shouted free Palestine, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4269.74s)]
*  free Palestine, while in police custody, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4272.94s)]
*  and implied that he committed the shooting. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4275.1s)]
*  This is definitely driven by what is currently happening [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4277.1s)]
*  in Palestine. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4280.02s)]
*  Since October 7th, 53,655 Palestinians [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4281.02s)]
*  have been killed in Gaza, [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4285.14s)]
*  according to the Gaza Health Ministry. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4286.46s)]
*  And those numbers may be underreported [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4288.38s)]
*  because thousands of bodies are believed [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4290.42s)]
*  to be buried under rubble. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4291.9400000000005s)]
*  I understand all of that, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4292.9400000000005s)]
*  but what I want us to understand [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4294.54s)]
*  is this is why you can't ignore what's going on [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4296.46s)]
*  in the rest of the world. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4298.860000000001s)]
*  What's going on in the rest of the world impacts us here, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4299.740000000001s)]
*  whether we are aware of what's going on or not. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4302.82s)]
*  I was in my office this morning [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4306.38s)]
*  and I looked at this couple, Sarah Milgram [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4308.259999999999s)]
*  and Yaron Lysinski, I think it is. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4312.42s)]
*  I was watching them this morning [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4314.94s)]
*  and I read that they were on a night out [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4316.099999999999s)]
*  and they were about to get engaged [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4317.78s)]
*  and it just simply hurt my feelings. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4319.58s)]
*  I don't care what their race is, their ethnicity. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4321.34s)]
*  All I saw was two humans who became casualties [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4324.46s)]
*  of a system that is failing us all, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4327.179999999999s)]
*  just like all those kids and innocent people [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4329.54s)]
*  being killed in Gaza are casualties of a failed system. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4331.74s)]
*  And it doesn't seem like it's gonna be an end to it [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4335.42s)]
*  anytime soon, okay? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4337.42s)]
*  People are just gonna be out here, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4338.66s)]
*  getting it back in blood, eye for an eye. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4340.42s)]
*  And I personally don't want to live in a world like that, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4342.9s)]
*  even though we already do, okay? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4346.099999999999s)]
*  We are already in that world [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4347.9s)]
*  because any of us can be casualties of a system. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4349.46s)]
*  Another country could send a nuclear weapon [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4353.38s)]
*  over here right now and kill us all [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4355.38s)]
*  because they don't like our government, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4358.22s)]
*  because they don't like our system. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4359.74s)]
*  When most people in America don't even like our government, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4362.3s)]
*  don't like our system, but we become casualties of it [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4364.66s)]
*  because we are part of the processes and the structures [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4367.42s)]
*  and policies of this country, whether we want to be or not. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4370.92s)]
*  And that's what I mean when I see this couple, okay, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4374.26s)]
*  that Elias Rodriguez gunned down, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4377.1s)]
*  he don't know what they was on, okay? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4379.18s)]
*  For all he knows, they might've worked at Israel's embassy [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4380.82s)]
*  and absolutely disagreed with how Israel is handling Gaza. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4382.9s)]
*  We don't know, but that's why Martin Luther King Jr. said, [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4386.02s)]
*  an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4389.14s)]
*  The same empathy I have for the innocent people [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4392.18s)]
*  and children being killed in Gaza [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4394.46s)]
*  is the empathy I have for this couple, Sarah and Yaron. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4396.14s)]
*  Okay, same empathy I have for the people [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4399.3s)]
*  who got killed at the concert on October 7th. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4401.1s)]
*  That could be any of us at any given time. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4403.06s)]
*  They was just a couple on a night out and got gunned down. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4405.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know about y'all, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4409.46s)]
*  but because of all of these mass shootings [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4411.1s)]
*  that happened in this country, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4412.92s)]
*  the way my anxiety is set up, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4413.900000000001s)]
*  when I'm out, I think about stuff like this, okay? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4415.580000000001s)]
*  If you don't, God bless you, all right? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4418.62s)]
*  But situations like this are my worst nightmare. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4420.7s)]
*  You just out with your lady [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4423.0199999999995s)]
*  and somebody shoots and kills you? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4424.2s)]
*  I'm not with that. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4426.38s)]
*  I don't respect it, I don't condone it. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4427.42s)]
*  I don't like seeing innocent people being killed. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4429.14s)]
*  Meanwhile, the puppet masters pulling the strings [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4431.14s)]
*  are highly protected, okay? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4433.14s)]
*  Them and their families don't have to worry [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4434.5599999999995s)]
*  about this stuff nearly as much as we do, okay? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4436.0199999999995s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, I know that people in charge [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4438.54s)]
*  of these systems can get it too, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4440.54s)]
*  but we the people have way less protection than they do. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4441.94s)]
*  I tell y'all all the time on this devil damn radio, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4444.62s)]
*  every day of our lives we are trying to avoid crazy, okay? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4447.76s)]
*  Do you understand how civilized we are as a society? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4452.52s)]
*  I know it don't seem like that, but think about it. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4456.56s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of people interact every day [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4459.6s)]
*  and for the most part, we mind our business, okay? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4463.320000000001s)]
*  Because all it takes is one guy like Elias Rodriguez [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4466.04s)]
*  to ruin all our days, okay? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4469.8s)]
*  We need to really pat ourselves on the back sometime [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4471.58s)]
*  and thank God that more of us aren't snapping. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4473.88s)]
*  Elias, I understand why he snapped, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4477.28s)]
*  but I disagree with innocent people getting killed [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4480.16s)]
*  because of his snapping. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4482.639999999999s)]
*  What Elias did isn't activism, it's terrorism [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4483.98s)]
*  and any of us could be the victim of that terrorism [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4487.32s)]
*  and if the reports are correct, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4489.84s)]
*  this couple, Sarah and Yaron, was attending an event [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4492.04s)]
*  to discuss humanitarian responses [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4496.96s)]
*  in the Middle East and North Africa. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4499.96s)]
*  So they was trying to build bridges, not burn them, okay? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4502.4s)]
*  We can't be like this as a society. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4505.16s)]
*  We can't ignore what happened to this couple in DC. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4508.04s)]
*  We can't ignore what's happening to innocent people in Gaza. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4509.68s)]
*  If you don't have empathy for it all, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4512.72s)]
*  I don't wanna talk to you, okay? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4514.92s)]
*  Because violence begets violence, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4516.36s)]
*  hatred breeds more hatred [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4517.84s)]
*  and if we allow our grief and anger [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4519.2s)]
*  to justify targeting innocent people, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4520.88s)]
*  whether in the name of Palestine or Israel, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4522.88s)]
*  then we lose our humanity. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4525.26s)]
*  Okay, this shooting in DC should be a reminder [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4527.72s)]
*  that the conflicts overseas [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4529.88s)]
*  have real consequences here at home [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4531.36s)]
*  and this is why we all should be demanding [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4533.16s)]
*  an end to violence on both sides, okay? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4535.56s)]
*  Shared humanity has to prevail over division. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4539.04s)]
*  Compassion gotta outweigh rage. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4542.240000000001s)]
*  Commitment to peace has to be louder than the voice of hate. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4544.200000000001s)]
*  Please give Elias Rodriguez the biggest he-huh. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4548.4800000000005s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4551.68s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4553.400000000001s)]
*  Just my thoughts, just the way I'm feeling at the time. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4554.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4557.0s)]
*  We're so doomed as people. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4557.84s)]

*  How you doing? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4653.419999999999s)]
*  Quick question. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4654.379999999999s)]
*  What's up? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4655.339999999999s)]
*  I mean, y'all was playing with lasers and all that stuff. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4656.299999999999s)]
*  So it just- [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4659.54s)]
*  Okay, what's wrong? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4660.54s)]
*  I just wanted to know, as a man, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4663.379999999999s)]
*  is six inches a good thing, or is that too small? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4665.54s)]
*  No, no, I don't think it is. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4670.54s)]
*  But I mean, I can't speak for every woman. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4672.259999999999s)]
*  Some women like for their walls to be torn down. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4674.099999999999s)]
*  Some women like to still have their walls [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4676.62s)]
*  when they're done a session. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4678.86s)]
*  I am one of those who need my walls and I want them. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4680.259999999999s)]
*  I don't want them to be torn down. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4683.339999999999s)]
*  So a six inch girthy is not bad. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4684.62s)]
*  I actually like that. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4687.46s)]
*  That actually puts you a little bit above average [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4688.299999999999s)]
*  because a lot of people got six inches, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4692.0199999999995s)]
*  but no girth is skinny, like a pencil in a pencil sharpener. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4693.74s)]
*  That's why I heard you say you're skinny. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4697.46s)]
*  So I was like, okay. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4699.219999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4700.5s)]
*  But I don't like asking females that stuff. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4701.339999999999s)]
*  Why? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4703.82s)]
*  We are the ones to ask. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4704.66s)]
*  We are the ones to ask. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4706.62s)]
*  Would you like to ask a man? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=4707.78s)]

*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5108.099999999999s)]
*  So Kim Kardashian graduated after six years. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5109.78s)]
*  It took her a little minute because of COVID [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5112.139999999999s)]
*  and her schedule. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5113.94s)]
*  And she gets a lot of like, flack for it. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5115.5s)]
*  People come at Kim about a lot of things, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5118.98s)]
*  but this whole law school thing, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5120.379999999999s)]
*  people are like, girl, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5121.379999999999s)]
*  you're not ever gonna really be a lawyer. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5122.66s)]
*  You're Kim Kardashian, let's not. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5124.9s)]
*  But she actually did do it. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5127.299999999999s)]
*  So in California, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5128.66s)]
*  you can complete a four-year law office study program. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5129.98s)]
*  It's called Reading the Law [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5132.66s)]
*  instead of actually going to law school. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5133.86s)]
*  And from here, she can now go to try and pass the bar [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5135.62s)]
*  so that she can actually, you know, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5138.219999999999s)]
*  be an active practicing attorney. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5139.7s)]
*  But I think people forget that her dad was a big attorney. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5141.82s)]
*  It seems like this is something she wants to do. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5144.259999999999s)]
*  And she's actually been active in doing that, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5146.459999999999s)]
*  but I think because she's Kim K [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5147.94s)]
*  and she be on Instagram and bikinis, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5148.74s)]
*  people be trying to play with her a little bit. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5150.46s)]
*  And she's done a lot. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5152.74s)]
*  Now she had a little ceremony in her backyard [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5153.94s)]
*  celebrating her graduation and Van Jones was there. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5156.219999999999s)]
*  And his video is getting a bit of flack too. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5159.0199999999995s)]
*  Let's take a listen. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5160.66s)]
*  Thank you, Kim Kardashian. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5161.78s)]
*  Six years ago, seven years ago, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5162.94s)]
*  when you're working on criminal justice, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5164.42s)]
*  you were not embraced by anybody. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5166.179999999999s)]
*  You were working with people [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5168.259999999999s)]
*  who were thrown away often by their own families. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5169.82s)]
*  You're working with people who are literally [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5172.74s)]
*  just one step from the grave. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5174.58s)]
*  A household name on five continents [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5176.82s)]
*  raised her hand since she wanted to help. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5179.7s)]
*  Not when it was easy, but when it was hard, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5182.0199999999995s)]
*  when it wasn't trendy. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5184.94s)]
*  And as a result, when you say 70,000 people are free, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5186.3s)]
*  it's easy to rush past that number. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5189.94s)]
*  The first step act alone, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5191.78s)]
*  which would have never been signed [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5193.82s)]
*  except for Kim Kardashian getting that snowball started, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5195.74s)]
*  has freed 40,000 human beings. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5198.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you gotta salute Kim, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5202.66s)]
*  but you also gotta salute, you know, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5204.179999999999s)]
*  a lot of the black eternities and activists [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5205.62s)]
*  that she worked with. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5207.38s)]
*  Britney Kay Barnett, Me Angel, Kody, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5208.86s)]
*  they've both been here on the Breakfast Club. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5212.0199999999995s)]
*  Jessica Jackson, she's been here [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5214.34s)]
*  on the Breakfast Club as well. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5215.66s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5217.42s)]
*  I can't sit here and act like Kim wasn't putting in work. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5218.66s)]
*  Yeah, and Van Jones actually did mention them, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5221.78s)]
*  and I believe Britney was there as well. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5223.66s)]
*  But I think some of the stuff that Kim gets thrown at her [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5226.74s)]
*  is unwarranted, because you need, [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5230.74s)]
*  a lot of times when you're bringing up these cases [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5233.26s)]
*  that people don't wanna talk about, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5235.06s)]
*  you need a name that makes people be like, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5236.22s)]
*  oh, okay, we care about this. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5237.820000000001s)]
*  And she put herself and her brand on the line to do that, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5239.5s)]
*  so I'm not mad about it. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5243.02s)]
*  And she don't just lean on her celebrity. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5243.860000000001s)]
*  She went back to school, she went to school, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5245.42s)]
*  she's got a degree in it now, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5248.18s)]
*  and she's actually working with the people [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5250.02s)]
*  who actually have been doing this work for a long time. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5253.02s)]
*  Like to your point, Lauren, you know, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5255.38s)]
*  you amplify a Britney Barnett, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5256.580000000001s)]
*  you amplify a Me Angel, Kody, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5258.38s)]
*  you amplify the work that Jessica Jackson has done [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5260.1s)]
*  just by being Kim Kardashian. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5262.34s)]
*  So I ain't about to sit around and hang on that. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5263.66s)]
*  And then she even, then she like, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5266.0599999999995s)]
*  she went to school and then she failed the bar [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5268.099999999999s)]
*  and then went back and retook it or something, right? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5269.98s)]
*  Yeah, she was having- So she did not give up. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5272.0199999999995s)]
*  Like she went back and she, this was something serious [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5273.58s)]
*  that she was passionate about, she wanted to do it. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5276.18s)]
*  Yeah, she was having issues with the baby bar. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5277.94s)]
*  Okay, but yeah, but- [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5280.5s)]
*  But that didn't stop her is what I'm saying. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5282.38s)]
*  Like she, this is something that she really wanted to do. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5284.18s)]
*  And shout out to Van Jones for recognizing her and that. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5286.98s)]
*  People love just grabbing and messing with, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5289.7s)]
*  I don't know what it is, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5291.82s)]
*  why people do that with Van Jones? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5292.66s)]
*  They love making fun of him online. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5293.9s)]
*  I don't know why. I love Van. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5295.46s)]
*  Yeah, but he didn't even cry in this thing that he- [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5296.74s)]
*  He cries a lot. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5299.86s)]
*  Yeah, he cries, he cries over white people a lot. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5300.7s)]
*  Yeah, he cries a lot. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5302.7s)]
*  He didn't cry in this one though, that I saw. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5303.54s)]
*  The video was Khloe Kardashian posted, no tears. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5305.62s)]
*  So he got through it. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5308.219999999999s)]
*  But real quick, I thought that this was interesting. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5309.98s)]
*  Amazon is giving refunds back, right? [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5312.179999999999s)]
*  To different people or different people [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5314.7s)]
*  who've been shopping at Amazon over the years. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5317.38s)]
*  Some of these refunds are going back as far as 2018. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5319.42s)]
*  So following a recent internal review, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5324.46s)]
*  Amazon said that they identified a very small subset [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5328.18s)]
*  of returns that they're going to issue a refund to, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5330.46s)]
*  that they issue refund to without completing the payment. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5334.22s)]
*  So these people got a refund, but they didn't get the money. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5336.78s)]
*  And we could not verify that the correct, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5338.74s)]
*  because they couldn't verify whether you got the correct [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5341.3s)]
*  item or if it was sent back to them. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5343.54s)]
*  So nothing was issued. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5345.7s)]
*  Now I don't know if y'all have ever returned [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5347.54s)]
*  something on Amazon or not. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5348.66s)]
*  Yes, but it is a hassle. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5350.86s)]
*  So I really don't like to do it. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5352.66s)]
*  I just resell what I want. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5353.9s)]
*  Why you think it's a hassle? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5355.38s)]
*  Cause you have to take it to like the certain places? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5356.22s)]
*  Yeah, you have to find a place, first of all, a place. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5357.82s)]
*  And they have like these little offsite, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5360.26s)]
*  little facility that you gotta take and trust people [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5362.66s)]
*  to get it back to them. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5365.98s)]
*  And then they take forever to give you your money back [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5366.94s)]
*  or to send you to give you the credit [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5368.74s)]
*  and then send you the stuff back. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5370.22s)]
*  They ask for hassle. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5371.3s)]
*  Sometimes certain shoppers too on there [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5372.14s)]
*  are like certain stores actually for pictures. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5373.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5375.74s)]
*  It's a whole thing. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5376.58s)]
*  I will take my refund back from 2018 though. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5378.3s)]
*  I saw this, I thought this was interesting [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5379.14s)]
*  because I've had issues with Amazon and refunds [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5380.14s)]
*  and trying to get my money back on Amazon. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5382.9800000000005s)]
*  But also you can send stuff back that it's easy to get the, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5384.42s)]
*  it's easy to send stuff back to, you know, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5388.9400000000005s)]
*  how you used to return stuff at Nordstrom [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5390.34s)]
*  and they wouldn't like check it. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5391.7s)]
*  Nordstrom had a very easy return policy. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5392.9s)]
*  Amazon used to be like that. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5395.26s)]
*  And I think they just caught up with all of us [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5396.58s)]
*  that was lying. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5397.9s)]
*  Well, baby, they caught up with all of us [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5398.82s)]
*  that been lying on Amazon. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5401.02s)]
*  They just caught up with you. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5401.86s)]
*  So you was committing fraud, Lauren. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5402.7s)]
*  But you know what is crazy? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5403.54s)]
*  You said all of us. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5405.38s)]
*  All of them. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5406.22s)]
*  I used to hit up Nordstrom Rack and then bring it back. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5407.900000000001s)]
*  Like I lost my receipt, which y'all talking about. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5411.1s)]
*  Amazon and Nordstrom were too. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5413.9400000000005s)]
*  So I think they've caught up with the people [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5415.780000000001s)]
*  who weren't really supposed to be returning things. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5417.26s)]
*  And now they're giving the money back [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5419.22s)]
*  to the people that really deserve it. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5420.34s)]
*  That's what made me think of like, dang, they caught up. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5421.5s)]
*  That's from back in the day. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5423.580000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5424.780000000001s)]
*  Charlotte, you ain't never did that? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5425.700000000001s)]

*  He was out here selling and smoking crack. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5428.38s)]
*  Well. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5431.26s)]
*  That's funny that you say that [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5432.1s)]
*  because both of y'all look like y'all doing [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5432.9400000000005s)]
*  a buddy cop movie and you look like undercover cops. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5433.76s)]

*  pulling up to somebody's trap in search of pounds of weed. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5441.54s)]
*  Bobby. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5444.38s)]

*  What the hell? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5447.3s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey guys, what the hell? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5448.14s)]
*  Any of y'all got any gas? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5450.66s)]
*  Whatever, whatever. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5451.86s)]
*  But those were the days when I used to hit up Nordstroms [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5453.38s)]
*  and Marshalls and Ross, by the way, y'all. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5456.18s)]
*  And I would, and you know, we would gather the things. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5458.0599999999995s)]
*  We would steal them and then bring it back. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5460.7s)]
*  And it was no receipt. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5462.46s)]
*  Ain't that what you were talking about? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5464.099999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5465.14s)]
*  I was talking about like you could buy things. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5465.98s)]
*  See, she just set you up. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5467.86s)]

*  I told you that. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5469.5199999999995s)]
*  You ain't listening. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5470.36s)]
*  Like you could buy, or people I know, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5471.2s)]
*  could buy things like Uggs from Nordstrom. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5473.459999999999s)]
*  And then like when your Uggs was like too ran down [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5475.379999999999s)]

*  you could take them back and get your money back [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5478.7s)]
*  or get a new pair of Uggs. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5481.0199999999995s)]
*  I wasn't talking about stealing. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5482.219999999999s)]

*  I've never put no damn Uggs random down to the ground [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5494.58s)]

*  to set other random people up [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5508.66s)]

*  This story was so random, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5512.66s)]
*  but it reminded me of my childhood. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5513.5s)]

*  I'm your lawyer. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5525.62s)]
*  Amazon said there is no action required [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5526.46s)]
*  for customers to receive the refunds. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5528.179999999999s)]
*  They have fixed the payment issue [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5529.86s)]
*  and they made processing changes to make it more prompt. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0wwutO4nE&t=5531.58s)]
