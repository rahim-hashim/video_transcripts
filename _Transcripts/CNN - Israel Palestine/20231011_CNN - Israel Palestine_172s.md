# Hamas official reveals intent behind assault on Israel on Russian TV
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc)
*  A brazen political move. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas demands that the U.S. negotiate the release of American hostages on Russian TV. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=3.4s)]
*  There are also prisoners in the U.S. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=9.36s)]
*  We want them, of course. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=13.0s)]
*  There are Hamas members sentenced to life in the U.S. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=14.56s)]
*  We demand that the U.S. frees our sons from their prisons. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=17.12s)]
*  The U.S. conducts prisoner swaps. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=20.2s)]
*  Only recently it did one with Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=21.94s)]
*  Why wouldn't it conduct one with us? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=23.76s)]
*  Confirmation of part of the intent behind the Hamas assaults in Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=26.36s)]
*  They were enabled by a failure of Israeli intelligence, but plotted by a shadowy Hamas [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=30.8s)]
*  officer they call al-Dif, the guest. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=37.8s)]
*  Only two photographs exist of Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, who's nearly 60. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  He's known as al-Dif because he billets as a guest in a different location every night. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=47.16s)]
*  He's the mastermind or monster behind the murder of more than a thousand in Israel and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=52.16s)]
*  the kidnapping of about 150 hostages. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=57.36s)]
*  From the beginning of his life he was very much interested in fighting the Israeli occupation. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=59.72s)]
*  In the mid-1990s he was believed to be behind a wave of atrocities in Israel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=67.36s)]
*  And in 2014 he's believed to have lost an arm and a leg in an Israeli airstrike aimed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=73.08s)]
*  at him that killed his wife and daughter. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=78.32s)]
*  For the last two years though, Hamas has pretended to focus on welfare, not warfare. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=81.39999999999999s)]
*  All the while under the table Hamas was preparing this big attack. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=88.24s)]
*  Israel meanwhile invested in automation and sensors, a high technology iron wall around [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  Gaza and focused forces on the West Bank. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=97.88s)]
*  Under Dif, Hamas encouraged Israeli complacency. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=101.24s)]
*  And last weekend it hit hard. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=106.44s)]
*  Attacking communication towers and automated machine guns with drones, overrunning command [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=109.8s)]
*  and control centers, killing senior officers, among them three colonels, and unleashing [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  terror on thousands of civilians. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  The Israel defense forces found Hamas anti-tank mines and other heavy weapons, a sign they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=126.52s)]
*  may have planned for a longer stay. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=131.36s)]
*  The shock infantry attack is either deliberately brutal from the start or degenerated into [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=136.08s)]
*  a massacre as Israeli defenses collapsed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  It shifted attention and power to Hamas. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  He has become like a god to some of the Palestinians because of what he has done. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=149.12s)]
*  Many Palestinians are dismayed by the massacre and the bloodshed that's followed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  But with the lives of hostages in his hands, the guest now has an unwelcome place in America's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=163.16s)]
*  mind. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=169.4s)]
*  Sam Kiley, CNN. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kufj_iN41Gc&t=170.4s)]
