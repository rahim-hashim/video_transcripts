# Breaking down what Biden said in Israel amid deadly Gaza hospital strike
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s)
*  President Biden here in Israel, in Tel Aviv, talking about many different things. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=0.0s)]
*  Number one, that he supports unequivocally Israel after that attack on October 7, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=6.24s)]
*  and talked about his long history with supporting this country all the way back to the 1970s, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=12.56s)]
*  right before the Yom Kippur War, talking to Golda Meir, who was the prime minister at the time. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=18.16s)]
*  By the way, the timing of that and the timing of this, almost exactly the same, the anniversary [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=23.12s)]
*  of the Yom Kippur War, October 7, when the attack happened here, that has really changed [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=29.04s)]
*  this nation and changed its position, as well as changed what it is willing to do to Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=36.32s)]
*  They are trying to, as all of the Israeli officials have said, rid all of Gaza of Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=44.48s)]
*  I want to bring in our Kaitlyn Collins, who was standing by and was in the room, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=51.44s)]
*  our David Chalyan as well, and our Clarissa Ward, who is here also in Israel with us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=55.28s)]
*  Kaitlyn, I'm going to go to you first. What stood out to you in hearing from the president? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=61.6s)]
*  This was another unequivocal support of Israel from the president of the United States. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=66.56s)]
*  Yeah, he loves telling that story there at the end. It was his first time here to Israel's 1972, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=76.48s)]
*  one year before, of course, the 1973 Yom Kippur War. It had this lasting effect on him. He [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=81.92s)]
*  often talks about sitting down with Goltemayir when she was the prime minister of Israel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=87.52s)]
*  Obviously, things are very different now. Here he is returning as the president of the United States. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=91.92s)]
*  Israel is at war. He's the first U.S. president to visit Israel when it is at war, something that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=96.56s)]
*  the prime minister Netanyahu noted earlier today. But as the president came out here today, Sarah, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=101.84s)]
*  he did make news. He said that Israel has agreed to an agreement to allow humanitarian aid into [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=106.64s)]
*  Gaza through Egypt. That has been something that has been a holdup for well over a week now, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=112.88s)]
*  despite international talks to create some kind of channel to allow that aid. And you've heard [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=118.0s)]
*  Egyptian officials say they have trucks waiting at that crosswalk crossing. That is the only [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=122.72s)]
*  way to get into Gaza through Egypt, waiting to get in. But it has been held up. They have blamed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=127.68s)]
*  the Israelis. The Israelis have pushed back on that. The question, of course, the president Biden [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=132.88s)]
*  did not note is the timing of that. When will that aid begin to flow into Gaza? But he did say [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=137.2s)]
*  there is an agreement. And he also said that the U.S. is going to provide 100 million dollars [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=142.48s)]
*  in assistance to Gaza and to the West Bank. Those are two notable developments coming out of here. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=147.6s)]
*  One thing that we did ask President Biden at the end, as he did, as you're right, he expressed that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=153.2s)]
*  solidarity with Israel once again, which was something his staff previewed on the way over [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=157.44s)]
*  here, which was tough questions. They said he was going to have for the prime minister. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=162.32s)]
*  And when you talk to officials about what those tough questions could be, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=166.4s)]
*  they referenced what's next here. If Israel does go into Gaza, if there is that ground invasion, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=170.32s)]
*  what is the timing of that look like? What is the objective of that? And what happens after that's [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=175.68s)]
*  over? You heard Prime Minister Netanyahu earlier warning that this could be a long road to victory [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=180.72s)]
*  was the phrase that he used. Of course, the question is how long and what it looks like after [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=186.0s)]
*  that. That's President Biden left the room. He did not answer that question. He did issue another [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=190.64s)]
*  warning, though, about one of his main concerns and one of the biggest things that I've heard [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=196.0s)]
*  from officials that I've spoken to in recent days, which is the idea that this could escalate into a [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  broader regional conflict. And that is only something that has become really more illuminated [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=204.16s)]
*  in the last 24 hours since that hospital was hit. I do want to note earlier today, the president [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=209.11999999999998s)]
*  said he did not believe it was Israel that was behind that explosion at that hospital in Gaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  He said it was someone from the other team here. He clarified those remarks. He said he believed [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=219.6s)]
*  that based on what he has heard and what he has seen, that it was an errant rocket from a Palestinian [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=224.16s)]
*  terrorist group. So that is an update there and a clarification there from his earlier remark that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=229.84s)]
*  was not very clear to what he believes it is. And that terrorist group that he is referring to, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=234.88s)]
*  Israel says it was Islamic Jihad, not Hamas, but it is another group that exists there that does not [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=243.76s)]
*  believe in the existence of Israel itself. I want to go now. Thank you, Caitlin, for that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=248.72s)]
*  Stick with us. I'm going to go now to David Chalyan. David, can you tell us about just the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=253.68s)]
*  significance that during an officially declared war that the president of the United States [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=257.2s)]
*  came into this country trying to get some humanitarian work done, coming to show solidarity, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=263.84s)]
*  but just the significance of him being here as we have seen rockets coming into this country [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=271.68s)]
*  every single day and night throughout. Meantime, there are explosions going on in Gaza at the same [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=276.96s)]
*  time and a huge humanitarian crisis going on there. What is the significance of him being here now? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=284.88s)]
*  Well, Sarah, you saw the president himself highlighted that he was the first president to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  visit Israel in a time of war. He wanted to make sure everybody understood that it is indeed a [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  significant move. And I think it was so clear what he was doing throughout his remarks. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=303.36s)]
*  The whole first half, as you and Caitlin were discussing, was that complete repetition of that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=307.92s)]
*  total solidarity with Israel, standing side by side in total support of Israel. And I think [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=313.04s)]
*  when you talk to folks around the president, what they believe that position does is allow him to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=320.72s)]
*  go into the second half of his remarks, which was to call on the better angels and the humanitarian [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=326.48s)]
*  sympathies of the people of Israel and not to get too consumed by their passions and anger [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=334.64000000000004s)]
*  in response to the terrorist attacks and that they keep in mind who they are as a people as he was [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=343.44s)]
*  trying to express the need for humanitarian assistance, for the ability for Israel to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=349.04s)]
*  by urging some restraint. And I think when you look at the remarks and how they were structured, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=361.92s)]
*  you see a president of the United States doing that very thing we've been talking about, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=367.44s)]
*  which is threading a needle here. Obviously, time will tell. The future will only tell us [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=372.24s)]
*  if that is successful. But it's clear that's what the objective was in its visit and putting [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=377.68s)]
*  a button on the visit with these remarks. Yeah, diplomacy is of the utmost importance here, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=382.32s)]
*  but very, very difficult to actually, as you put it, thread that needle. I want to go now [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=391.2s)]
*  to Clarissa Ward, who is here with me in Israel. I am curious from your perspective after hearing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=396.72s)]
*  what you did about the humanitarian breakthrough, hopefully, although it has not happened, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=403.28s)]
*  and Gaza by the hour is getting more and more desperate for the civilians there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  How do you think that the Arab world, Jordan, people in Jordan, people who are protesting right [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  now in Beirut and the response in the West Bank, how they're going to react to hearing [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  the president's comments from Tel Aviv today? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=427.52s)]
*  I think the reactions will not be positive. This will be seen as a full-throated endorsement [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=433.76s)]
*  of Israel and of Israel's comportment over the last 10 days, which obviously Arab countries have [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  denounced. I think there will be a lot of talk about what wasn't said. There was no call for [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=449.2s)]
*  restraint. There was no call for a ceasefire. It's important to remind viewers that the leaders of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=455.2s)]
*  these Arab countries have many young people who are now impassioned and outraged and upset and [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=462.64s)]
*  are taking to the streets. And so they have to be seen as taking a hard stance, as supporting the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=469.03999999999996s)]
*  Palestinian people. They are also trying, just like President Biden, to thread the needle, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  if you will. He did say, as you mentioned, that there has been some agreement on the Israeli side [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=482.24s)]
*  to allow the passage of aid into Gaza with the proviso that Hamas does not divert that aid. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=488.48s)]
*  But he also said that he hoped that would happen as soon as possible, with no real clarity or sense [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=495.76s)]
*  of when that might be. And I agree with David that he did issue as well some gentle warnings [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=503.36s)]
*  to Israel after the first half of the speech, which was all about this remarkable display [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=510.72s)]
*  of solidarity with Israel. He said, we have felt that rage after 9-11. We learned from mistakes [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=516.24s)]
*  that were made after 9-11. I believe his quote was, while you feel that rage, don't be consumed [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=522.64s)]
*  about it and make sure that you have clarity about your objectives. That is obviously [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=528.88s)]
*  urging Israel's leaders to think very strategically and very clearly about what comes next. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=535.44s)]
*  Everybody has been waiting for quite some time now for this much-anticipated ground invasion. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=542.4s)]
*  There are very real questions, I think, being asked by world leaders from many different [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=548.72s)]
*  countries about what that looks like, what the tangible result would be of that. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=554.3199999999999s)]
*  The Israelis have said they want to essentially dismantle and uproot Hamas once and for all. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  But still, questions remain. How do you go about doing that? Who steps in to fill the void [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=565.36s)]
*  afterwards? We have heard previously President Biden say in an interview on 60 Minutes that he [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=570.48s)]
*  does not think it would be a good idea for Israel to try to reoccupy Gaza. And so I think just a [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=575.76s)]
*  subtle warning that now is also a time to take a deep breath and think very, very clearly about [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=582.88s)]
*  what the next moves might be and what the ramifications of those might be. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=590.96s)]
*  And also a very stern warning, presumably to Iran, to Hezbollah, to others in the region who [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  might be watching this moment. He said who might be thinking of attacking Israel. He said, quote, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=603.12s)]
*  don't, don't, don't, Sarah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=608.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, some incredibly salient points from you there. Cloris Award and Ashkelon. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=614.72s)]
*  Caitlin Collins here in Tel Aviv and David Chalian in Washington. Thank you to you all. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4m7bnDl0s&t=619.44s)]
