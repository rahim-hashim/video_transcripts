# Israeli man sees his home for first time since Hamas killed his family
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik)
*  Tonight we are learning new details about the two Israeli hostages who were just released in recent hours by Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=0.0s)]
*  Nareed Cooper and you have it leaf sheets were abducted from their kibbutz along with their husbands who still remain hostages tonight [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  This war is being fought not on some remote battlefield, but in quiet communities where families [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=14.44s)]
*  Previously grew their crops and raised their kids just yesterday an Israeli soldier was killed and three others were injured [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=20.52s)]
*  During a raid in the area of kibbutz kiss of theme near the Gaza Strip [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=27.36s)]
*  I was there just 24 hours before where you can see Gaza from people's backyards [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=31.4s)]
*  About 10 reporters were taken inside this kibbutz to see the horrific aftermath of the October 7th attack [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=37.16s)]
*  I want to show you what we saw, but I do want to warn you that some of what you're about to see is graphic [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=43.92s)]
*  Kibbutz kiss of theme sits less than three miles away from the Gaza border a quiet community where residents grow avocados and raise poultry and their families [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=50.6s)]
*  But as the sun rose on Saturday, October 7th the kibbutz that around 300 people called home became the site of a massacre as Hamas militants stormed inside and murdered 14 people kidnapping four others [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=59.6s)]
*  Major Marcus Sheff, a reservist in the Israel Defense Forces, watched from home as the brutal attack unfolded that day [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=72.6s)]
*  Now he's leading a small group of foreign press into the kibbutz for the first time, wanting the world to bear witness to the atrocities firsthand [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=79.6s)]
*  The shock is still there after two weeks [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=88.6s)]
*  We've seen the damage and yet it's still happening [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=91.6s)]
*  The stench of death is thick in the air as you walk along the tree-lined streets [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=95.6s)]
*  But if you didn't look too closely, you'd never guess that a slaughter took place here [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=100.6s)]
*  Then you notice the bullet hole in Gina Smiatich's door [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=105.6s)]
*  The 90-year-old grandmother, who loved gardening, was in her bathroom when Hamas militants stormed the kibbutz [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=109.6s)]
*  Then you notice the bullet hole in Gina Smiatich's door [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=115.6s)]
*  The 90-year-old grandmother, who loved gardening, was in her bathroom when Hamas militants shot her in the head [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=119.6s)]
*  Her blood is still smeared on the entryway two weeks later [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=126.6s)]
*  If you didn't look over here, it would just look like a regular home on a Saturday morning [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=130.6s)]
*  Orange juice out, the newspaper, her mail, some cookies [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=135.6s)]
*  When you look over here at the kitchen, you can see people have gone through it, they opened all the cabinets [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=141.6s)]
*  There's still cups in the sink, her kettle is still out [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=147.6s)]
*  And Gina is one of several who was brutally murdered in her kibbutz on that Saturday morning [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=153.6s)]
*  The Zak family lived just down the street [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=161.6s)]
*  Parents Atai, Eddie, and their 14-year-old son, Sagi, were at home when the attack began [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=164.6s)]
*  Their older children, Hadar and Tamer, were away [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=170.6s)]
*  We reached 24-year-old Hadar on FaceTime [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=173.6s)]
*  What's through there? What was through that window? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=176.6s)]
*  This is the first time he's able to see the charred remains of his family's home [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=179.6s)]
*  Someone from the kibbutz told me that he opened the mamad and he found my dad laying on the ground with my dog [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=184.6s)]
*  Just watching the doors so the terrorists won't come in [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=190.6s)]
*  The bodies of his mother and little brother were found hugging each other in the nearby bomb shelter [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=193.6s)]
*  They asphyxiated after militants set their home on fire [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=199.6s)]
*  Just days before, Sagi was dancing his heart out at a Bruno Mars concert in Tel Aviv [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=204.6s)]
*  I'm 24, we have 10 years between us [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=212.6s)]
*  It's hard for me to say my little brother because he was my child [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=214.6s)]
*  Hadar and his sister Tamer are now orphans [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=217.6s)]
*  His grief and his anger is palpable [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=220.6s)]
*  It's kind of absurd to me that you guys show me this forest and not someone from Israel [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=224.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? I love my kibbutz, my kibbutz is amazing [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=229.6s)]
*  But the government... [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=232.6s)]
*  I have no words to describe the support [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=236.6s)]
*  Just 24 hours later in the Kisafim area, an IDF soldier is killed and three others wounded during a raid ahead of Israel's expected ground invasion in Gaza [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=239.6s)]
*  An ominous warning shot of what is yet to come [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=250.6s)]
*  It's difficult to watch [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=255.6s)]
*  And I do want to note that we got permission from these families to go into their homes [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=257.6s)]
*  Something that felt invasive to be there [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=262.6s)]
*  But was so important to them and to Hadar to be able to see his house for the first time [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=265.6s)]
*  I want to express our gratitude for them for letting us in, to see their pain and to tell their stories [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=269.6s)]
*  As well as to Major Marcus Sheff for taking us inside that kibbutz [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmJf7cFKxik&t=275.6s)]
