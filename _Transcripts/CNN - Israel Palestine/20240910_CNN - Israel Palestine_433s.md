# 'They told us this area was safe': Designated Gaza safe zone targeted by Israeli airstrike
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ)
*  Rescuers have been digging through sand and debris at a camp for displaced Palestinians [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=0.0s)]
*  after an overnight strike by Israeli forces left scores of people dead, wounded or missing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=5.28s)]
*  The Israeli military says it struck Hamas terrorists' operating command centre embedded [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=12.24s)]
*  in the humanitarian safe zone in Khan Yunus. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=16.64s)]
*  Hamas denies its fighters were present. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=19.84s)]
*  Gaza civil defence officials say entire families disappeared into the sand. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=22.96s)]
*  The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says the civilians in the Almawati area had no way to escape. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=28.36s)]
*  If you try and picture the area, these are the most crowded surroundings you could imagine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=36.68s)]
*  There's barely room to walk in between tents that are crowded onto beaches. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=43.72s)]
*  It was late at night. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=49.16s)]
*  Colleagues heard what they believe were the strikes and just absolutely devastating. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=50.68s)]
*  No way whatsoever that the civilians in these areas were able to protect themselves. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=57.48s)]
*  Israeli forces have previously hit Almawati in their pursuit of Hamas commanders. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=66.92s)]
*  A strike in mid-July killed at least 90 Palestinians. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=73.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, for more, Sinead's Matthew Chance monitoring this from Tel Aviv in Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  I know that the detail is still coming in, but what more do we know about this strike in areas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=83.8s)]
*  I say previously struck by the IDF in pursuit, they say, of Hamas terrorists back in July? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, Becky, I mean, first thing you can notice, one of the first things you notice [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=100.44s)]
*  when you look at the video and the images that are coming out of the Almawati region [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=104.52s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip is that this was a massive attack. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=111.0s)]
*  I mean, the weaponry that was involved is extremely powerful, clearly. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Some of the craters that have been left by the strikes are seven meters deep. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=120.36s)]
*  And so an extraordinary amount of damage has been caused in what would have been a densely populated [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  sort of area, humanitarian zone in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=131.88s)]
*  And, of course, civilians and ordinary people are again paying that very high price. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=135.16s)]
*  As rescue workers scrambled for survivors, eyewitnesses say the Israeli strikes [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  targeted what was meant to be a safe zone in the southern Gaza Strip, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=149.72s)]
*  ripping through tents and makeshift shelters, leaving deep craters, and dozens have killed and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=154.12s)]
*  injured. They told us this area was safe, says this man. I swear the people here were just normal, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=160.36s)]
*  he says, not fighters. By daylight, you can see the extent of the destruction. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  Israel's military says it conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  operating a command and control center inside this humanitarian zone. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=181.08s)]
*  An IDF statement says prior to the strike, numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=186.84s)]
*  of harming civilians. This was a heavily populated area and civilians were caught up [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=192.6s)]
*  in the powerful blasts. This man says his two daughters were completely buried under the sand. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  Only one survived, he says. He says he found the body parts of his neighbors strewn around. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=210.44s)]
*  This 12-year-old girl is nursing a broken shoulder, suffered when her tent collapsed, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=217.0s)]
*  she says, trapping her and her mother inside. I was scared because the strikes were so close, she says. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=222.68s)]
*  Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields and insists the Israeli military takes [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=230.52s)]
*  extensive measures to enable civilians in Gaza to avoid combat zones. But there's little real [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=240.36s)]
*  security in this brutal war. Well, Becky, as you mentioned, this exact humanitarian zone, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  this camp, had been struck before back in July with Palestinian health officials saying that 90 [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=259.08s)]
*  people were killed back then. Israeli military saying they were targeting Hamas militants, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=264.84s)]
*  but the health ministry in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, of course, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=270.84s)]
*  saying that at least half of that figure were women and children. So, again, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=274.92s)]
*  underlining just what a poor state of security exists inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=279.48s)]
*  Matthew, meantime, IDF has said an investigation has been launched into the death last week of an [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=288.52s)]
*  American killed in the West Bank. Now, the US Secretary of State has just weighed in on that, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=295.64s)]
*  so I want you and our viewers just to have a listen to what Antony Blinken has just said. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=301.8s)]
*  No one, no one should be shot and killed for attending a protest. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=308.52s)]
*  No one should have to put their life at risk just for freely expressing their views. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=313.32s)]
*  In our judgment, Israeli security forces need to make some fundamental changes in the way that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=321.48s)]
*  they operate in the West Bank, including changes to their rules of engagement. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=327.72s)]
*  Well, I assume we haven't yet had an IDF statement in response to Antony Blinken's words, which were [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=334.92s)]
*  in the past couple of hours. But what are the IDF saying at this point? They've said that they've [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=341.4s)]
*  launched an investigation. Do we have results of that? The investigation has been launched, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=347.8s)]
*  certainly, to try and get to the bottom of it. There's been a sort of preliminary announcement [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=356.04s)]
*  by the Israeli defence forces saying that they believe that the killing of this American Turkish [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=361.08s)]
*  activist, Aishinor Ezgi Egi, was unintentional and indirect. They said that actually what they've [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=367.96s)]
*  learned is that the shots were fired at one of the protesters that had been hurling stones and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=376.44s)]
*  burning tires in front of Israeli forces in the West Bank. But we're expecting more information [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=384.76s)]
*  to come out in the hours ahead. There's going to be a briefing shortly with the chief spokesperson [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=392.76s)]
*  for the Israeli defence forces, so we might get some more clarity. But clearly, the United States [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, they're not happy at all that another American, and there's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=404.76s)]
*  been a couple, who have been killed in the West Bank while protesting. To recap what he said, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=412.52s)]
*  no one should be killed for attending a protest. And of course, he called on Israel later on [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=417.96s)]
*  to fundamentally change the way it operates inside the West Bank. And so, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=422.92s)]
*  signs there that the United States is being increasingly critical of how Israel operates. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrqXnnPe4FQ&t=426.84s)]
