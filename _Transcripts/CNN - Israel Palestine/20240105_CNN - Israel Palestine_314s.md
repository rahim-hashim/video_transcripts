*  They absolutely put on a show to dress me up in nice clothes and shoes before I was [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=0.0s)]
*  released when my girls and I were barefoot for 50 days and we were cold because we were [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  wearing short sleeves in November. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=10.9s)]
*  It's one big show. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=13.44s)]
*  Doron Asher opening up and revealing what really happened to her and her two young daughters [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=14.44s)]
*  while held captive by Hamas for nearly 50 days. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  Once you got into Gaza, what happened? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=23.48s)]
*  We got into our hiding place, an apartment that belonged to a family. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=29.52s)]
*  We were inside the room without the ability to get out, of course, closed door, closed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=33.72s)]
*  window. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=38.68s)]
*  And after 16 days, they relocated us to another place, a so-called hospital. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=39.68s)]
*  Did anyone tell you what was going on, why you were there? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=45.46s)]
*  Were they members of Hamas? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=49.2s)]
*  They didn't give us a lot of information. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=53.28s)]
*  They mainly tried to say that Hamas wants to release us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  But in Israel, no one cares about us, which wasn't true. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  We didn't believe most of the stuff that they were saying. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=61.96s)]
*  And of course, it wasn't true. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=64.7s)]
*  Just over the border in Israel, Doron's husband Yoni never gave up hope. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=66.74s)]
*  Why is his daddy not coming? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=71.32s)]
*  I'm afraid that they won't recognize me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=73.52s)]
*  The stuff that they've seen on October 7th, I couldn't hide from them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=79.48s)]
*  It's like we were in a war movie. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=83.88s)]
*  But after that, it was very important to me that they wouldn't feel danger. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=86.16s)]
*  And I told them there are no terrorists anymore. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=89.78s)]
*  And we are good people who are guarding us until we can return home. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=91.88s)]
*  Were they good to you, the people? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=96.32s)]
*  They didn't physically harm me, but there was a lot of psychological warfare. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=101.92s)]
*  Like what? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=106.56s)]
*  That we won't return to live in the kibbutz because it's not our house, it's not the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=107.56s)]
*  place where we belong. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=112.84s)]
*  Did you know if they were Hamas or just citizens in Gaza? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=114.48s)]
*  They didn't give me a lot of info about them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=122.0s)]
*  I don't even know their names. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=124.08s)]
*  I guess that the father is with Hamas, but they didn't even give me much info. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=125.76s)]
*  I just know he worked in Israel in the past, and that's how he knows Hebrew, and that's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=129.6s)]
*  how we communicated. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  Were there other children there? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, he had children and grandchildren. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=136.6s)]
*  And basically his children were watching us 24-7. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=139.28s)]
*  I asked every day about my family, if they knew anything about Gadi, about my brother, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=142.6s)]
*  about my brother's baby girl. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=147.6s)]
*  They didn't give me any answers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  Why do you think they moved you after 16 days? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=151.45999999999998s)]
*  I think they tried to gather hostages together because the day that we arrived to this so-called [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=158.16s)]
*  hospital, other hostages arrived there as well. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=162.48s)]
*  And that was the first time that I met other hostages. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=165.12s)]
*  Why do you keep saying so-called hospital? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=168.16s)]
*  A hospital needs to treat sick people. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=171.88s)]
*  It doesn't hold hostages. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  There were a few times when the girls had high fever and they were sick, and I had to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=175.96s)]
*  take care of them, and I needed to get them medication. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=180.04s)]
*  So they brought someone who they said that was a doctor, and the next day I got medication [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=183.2s)]
*  from him for the girls, but it wasn't enough. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=188.46s)]
*  I used to put Aviv in the sink with cold water to bring down her temperature, but she was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=190.84s)]
*  screaming, and they would tell us to keep quiet. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=195.68s)]
*  And the girl had high fever, but I had to take care of her somehow. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=198.67999999999998s)]
*  And were you worried that by mistake, that you and your girls would have been in danger [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=202.16s)]
*  as Israel was trying to retrieve you? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=208.16s)]
*  I heard the fighting, and yes, we were scared. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=213.76s)]
*  The noises were very strong, very loud, but at least that's how we knew that something [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  was going on in order to get us back home, to put the pressure on Hamas to release us. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=220.16s)]
*  What did you fear the most when you were there? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=225.0s)]
*  Surprisingly, it was the day that we were released. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=228.64s)]
*  They were smuggling us out of the hospital, and they got us on a Hamas vehicle to get [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  to a meeting point with the Red Cross. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=237.88s)]
*  We waited a long time for the Red Cross, and we were very scared because we didn't know [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  what was going on. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=244.0s)]
*  No one gave us any info. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=245.26s)]
*  Once the Red Cross vehicles had arrived, thousands of Gazans, thousands, children, elderly, everyone [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  came in and started to climb on the cars and bang on the cars. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=253.42s)]
*  I was holding my girls, and I was scared of a lynch mob. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=257.16s)]
*  And this was the first time that Raz had said to me after a month and a half of me protecting [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  her, mommy, I'm scared. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  Today, the girls are back in kindergarten and with family therapy, for the most part, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=266.08s)]
*  are readjusting well. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=270.96s)]
*  There was one day that they saw a tractor here, and they asked if the evil men are here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=274.12s)]
*  And I had to tell them, no, the tractor doesn't belong to the evil men. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=278.46s)]
*  The evil men are in jail. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=282.0s)]
*  And while they mourn their grandmother... [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=283.8s)]
*  This is my mom. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=285.84s)]
*  Doron says the healing cannot really begin until all of the remaining 129 hostages are [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=287.4s)]
*  released, including Gadi Moses. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=293.52s)]
*  The world has to understand the reality that the hostages are in. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=299.0s)]
*  I don't want to think about how they're treating men there, how they're treating the young [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  women that are there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=306.68s)]
*  People who kidnap children and old people are not human. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ1mGV8r4FM&t=308.52s)]
