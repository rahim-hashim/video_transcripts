# IDF says video shows Hamas militant outside hospital with RPG launcher
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q)
*  All right with us now seeing a military analyst and former NATO Supreme Allied [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Commander General Wesley Clark. General I want to start with Al-Shifa we were [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=3.44s)]
*  just hearing about that right there. Let me just read you this latest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=6.88s)]
*  CNN report as you locate that on the map. A U.S. official with knowledge of the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=10.0s)]
*  American intelligence says Hamas as a command [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=14.08s)]
*  node under that hospital and uses fuel intended for the hospital and its [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=16.72s)]
*  fighters and they the fighters regularly cluster [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  around that hospital. So that information from a U.S. official [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=25.6s)]
*  as we're getting new video from the IDF of the Al-Quds hospital that's a [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=28.64s)]
*  hospital nearby it's no longer operational but there are still [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=33.44s)]
*  people inside waiting to be evacuated and you can see [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=36.88s)]
*  in this footage from the IDF what they have circled and identified as a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=40.24s)]
*  terrorist with an RPG launcher at the front door of the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  hospital going in and out of the hospital. So General if you [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=49.92s)]
*  will just talk about this talk about how Hamas uses these structures and how [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=53.92s)]
*  that complicates Israeli efforts in the region. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=60.96s)]
*  Well this was a long developed plan by Hamas [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=65.92s)]
*  to use international laws of land warfare [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=70.08s)]
*  against the Israelis to be able to bring [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  global pressure against the Israelis when they retaliated. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=77.44s)]
*  So the tunnel network has been built according to all the information that's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=81.28s)]
*  been made public so that its center node is under these [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=86.08s)]
*  hospitals. This is where the nexus of the tunnel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  network is and Hamas did this deliberately. Now from [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=93.6s)]
*  the Israeli perspective they are under international law so [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=97.76s)]
*  they have to protect humanitarian facilities. They cannot [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=102.32s)]
*  bomb hospitals. They have not bombed this hospital but they do have the right [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=107.2s)]
*  to self-defense and they are going to have to go into [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=111.04s)]
*  these hospitals and get into those command nodes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  Maybe the command nodes will have been evacuated by them [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=117.2s)]
*  but there is a fight for this and there is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=120.72s)]
*  a concern about this by the Israelis to try to avoid the global [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=123.68s)]
*  implications of what they're doing but they're still bound by the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=128.4s)]
*  laws of land warfare. So we have one side that's [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=132.4s)]
*  legally trying to deal with an enemy you have the other side which is cynically [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=135.52s)]
*  exploiting international law to put its own people at risk and use them as [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=139.68s)]
*  hostages. That's what this is really about John. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  And again because you see the images like the ones of the babies from the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  neonatal unit there out of the incubators here being warm by tinfoil and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=152.32s)]
*  water here and these are images that Reuters has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=157.12s)]
*  provided but that do some work for Hamas so people can see [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=159.68s)]
*  what's happening in the hospital and people are suffering inside there general. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=164.08s)]
*  It's terrible really condition and it is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=169.12s)]
*  it is the fault of Hamas. Under international law [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=172.72s)]
*  Hamas should have no military operations no defense of that hospital get away [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=176.0s)]
*  from it leave the doctors and patients there the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  Israelis will come in provide security for it and pick up the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=184.0s)]
*  medical responsibilities. That's what should be happening but as [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=187.52s)]
*  long as Hamas is using it as a base of operations going to be very difficult [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=191.44s)]
*  for Israel to get in and assume the humanitarian [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=195.76s)]
*  responsibilities that it must under international law assume. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=199.04s)]
*  Let me ask you very quickly what has been happening in Syria because a new [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=203.28s)]
*  round of U.S. strikes took place in eastern Syria and we've seen attacks [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  before from the U.S. on targets that it says are used by [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=212.56s)]
*  Iranian proxies in that part of the country to attack U.S. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=217.04s)]
*  interests. What's happening here? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=221.04s)]
*  So this is an effort again by the United States to strike back at Iran who's the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=223.68s)]
*  source of the problem without escalation. So it's a balance between hitting the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=230.0s)]
*  forces hitting the command nodes hitting the logistics that are supporting the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=235.28s)]
*  attacks on the American forces without going to the source and without [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=240.4s)]
*  escalating. But this is a slight escalation because as I understand it [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  we're not just hitting the the the militias out there we're actually [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  attacking some Iranian Revolutionary Guards components there in Syria. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  So we're actually going after Iranians who are in Syria. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=262.64s)]
*  So this represents a slight escalation. Embarrassed watching. General Wesley [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=266.8s)]
*  Clark always great to have you. Thank you very much. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCqvBYBqC2Q&t=270.64s)]
