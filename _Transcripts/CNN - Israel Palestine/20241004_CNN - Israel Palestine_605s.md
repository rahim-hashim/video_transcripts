# Attack on Israel was the 'least punishment' says Iran's Supreme Leader
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs)
*  What were the key lines from Iran's supreme leader, Fred? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think one of the things that you said at the beginning is absolutely key, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=7.88s)]
*  that the fact that the Iranian supreme leader gave that sermon today and held the Friday prayers and led the Friday prayers, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=11.0s)]
*  that in itself already shows just how important he feels the situation is now, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=16.64s)]
*  and of course, also how big a blow for himself and for Iran, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=20.76s)]
*  the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah, was. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  You absolutely correctly stated that the last time Ali Khamenei led those Friday prayers was in 2020, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=28.72s)]
*  which was, of course, shortly after the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=34.44s)]
*  the leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, Quds Force, someone who was also very close to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=38.28s)]
*  So that in itself was a big deal. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  And I think we could see that also as far as the turnout was concerned at the Mosala compound, Becky. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=46.8s)]
*  We've, of course, been in that compound so many times in the past four Friday prayers, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  and I really have never seen it as full as we saw on some of those images today. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=57.08s)]
*  Now, as far as the key lines are concerned, I think there were really two main things that the supreme leader wanted to convey. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  On the one hand, he was calling for unity among Muslim nations in the fight, as he put it, against the aggressor, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=67.88s)]
*  which, of course, can only mean the United States and Israel first and foremost. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=74.52s)]
*  I want to listen into what some of what he had to say as far as the relations between Iran, Lebanon and the Palestinians are concerned. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=80.04s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=87.84s)]
*  I'm stating that the enemy of the Iranian nation is the enemy of the Palestinian nation, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=91.44s)]
*  the same enemy of the Lebanese nation, the same government is the enemy of the Iraqi nation, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=97.08s)]
*  the enemy of the Egyptian nation, the enemy of the Syrian nation, the enemy of the Yemeni nation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=103.44s)]
*  The enemy is one. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  The ways of the enemy in different countries is different. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=113.2s)]
*  So there you see the supreme leader calling for the nations of that region to unite, obviously against Israel and against Israel's backers, the United States. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=120.08s)]
*  The other big message that I think we heard from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was the fact that he praised those missile strikes that the Iranians conducted against Israeli territory, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=129.68s)]
*  calling them legitimate, but also said that there would be much heavier Iranian strikes if Israel decides to retaliate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=138.56s)]
*  Obviously, right now, the Islamic Republic of Iran is bracing for a possible large strike. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=145.24s)]
*  And one of the things that we also have to keep in mind in that, Becky, which I think is really important, is that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Force, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  the aerospace force that conducted that missile strike is the same one that's also responsible for air defenses in Iran as well, Becky. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=157.76s)]
*  Let's pull these threads together. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=164.64s)]
*  My next guest, Middle East scholar Vali Nasser, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  quote, leaders in Tehran believe that Washington will restrain Israel in order to prevent a regional conflagration. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=170.88s)]
*  Well, Vali Nasser joins me now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  And Vali, let's just interrogate what you wrote. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=181.04s)]
*  Why do you think Iran holds that belief? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=183.96s)]
*  And further, is it a safe bet from Iran that Washington will restrain Israel at this point? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, Iran understands, as do many Americans and many other leaders in the region, that the United States does not want a war in the Middle East, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=195.12s)]
*  that it has been trying to move away from military entanglements in the Middle East. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=205.08s)]
*  So starting with that, it means that Iran believes that unlike Israel, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=209.4s)]
*  which might be pursuing a military solution to the crisis that it's in, that the United States wants to avert that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  And secondly, because when Iran and Israel exchanged missiles in April and then when Israel killed the leader of Hamas, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=219.8s)]
*  Ismail Haniya in Tehran, both times the United States lobbied with Iran intensely and either not to respond at all, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=228.08s)]
*  as in the case of Haniya, or at least to temper its response as it did in April. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=235.76s)]
*  So at least looking at that record of the past number of months, every time that there's been a potential for a region wide war, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=241.04s)]
*  the United States has stepped in. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  On October the 1st, in the wake of the barrage of ballistic missiles that were fired from Iran to Israel, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=253.64s)]
*  you asked a couple of questions, which I think are really pertinent at this point. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=263.16s)]
*  You said, why did Iran's leaders choose to so brazenly confront Israel now? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=266.48s)]
*  And how is Iran likely to act going forward? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  Three days on, do we have a decent answer to either of those questions at this point? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=278.6s)]
*  Well, the killing of Hassan Nasrallah and also the killing of a large number of Hezbollah leaders and commanders [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=285.44s)]
*  and Israel pushing to Lebanon clearly was a big challenge to Iran. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=293.44s)]
*  It was a major military victory for Israel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=298.56s)]
*  So Iran had to assert itself in a way that would, first of all, not allow Israel to over read into this success [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  and then want to, for instance, attack Iran. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=310.88s)]
*  It also wanted to give the Lebanese and particularly the battered Hezbollah commanders [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=313.6s)]
*  that are remaining a sense of support that Iran has not folded, has not abandoned the field, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  particularly because many in the Arab world began to accuse Iran of not having defended Hezbollah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=325.88s)]
*  So I think it was a show of force by Iran to both tell the United States and Israel [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=331.12s)]
*  that it has the capability and will to escalate this conflict in ways that the U.S. doesn't want, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=337.16s)]
*  but also to assert in the region with its allies as well as observers that the defeat of Hezbollah in Lebanon so far [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=342.6s)]
*  should not be interpreted as Iran backing away from its positions in the region. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  So what stood out to you listening to the Supreme Leader earlier, given what we've just discussed? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=359.12s)]
*  I think these were all the themes that he put forward. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=366.16s)]
*  He was very defiant. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=369.32000000000005s)]
*  He asserted that Iran remains committed to supporting Hezbollah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=371.04s)]
*  And in fact, by speaking in Arabic, he basically was underscoring that he sees a continuum [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=375.68s)]
*  between Iran's military posture and Hezbollah's military posture and that he's going to back Hezbollah, whatever it takes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=382.8s)]
*  He also was essentially sending a signal to United States and Israel that Iran continues to be willing to attack Israel [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=391.16s)]
*  or if it comes to the United States, if they pursue an aggressive policy, particularly against Iran. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=400.88s)]
*  But he also told the Iranian people that Iran will act prudently and it will engage militarily only if it's necessary. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=406.84s)]
*  So he was trying to hit many different buttons here, both with the Iranian population, with the United States and Israel, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=416.24s)]
*  and also with the Lebanese and in the Arab world. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=424.64s)]
*  Iran stands firm, stands tall, is willing to act, fight. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=427.6s)]
*  But today, Iranians, he was saying that we're not going to push for a war that you don't want. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=432.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's fascinating, isn't it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=439.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, not only in Arabic did he very specifically speak to the Palestinians, the Lebanese, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=440.32000000000005s)]
*  he also name checked Iraq and Egypt and sort of co-opted the kind of Arab world in his narrative today, which I thought was fascinating. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=446.24s)]
*  Ministers from Gulf Arab states and Iran attended a meeting in Doha, in Qatar this week. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=455.92s)]
*  And I just want to get your sense of what was seen and said there. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  Reuters reporting that the Gulf Arabs sought to reassure Iran of their, quote, neutrality in this conflict. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=469.92s)]
*  That was according to unnamed officials. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  Look, my sources around this region, and I'm sure you speak to many in the region who have said for months [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=480.68s)]
*  that they have real concerns about wider escalation, which could ultimately obviously affect Gulf countries, their oil facilities. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=486.24s)]
*  What's the strategic calculus that you see here with these Gulf Arabs in speaking to, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  reaching out to the Iranians at present and certainly not certainly not making an enemy of Tehran? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=504.36s)]
*  What is a very, very important time for the region? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=513.6800000000001s)]
*  It's actually more than not making an enemy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=518.2s)]
*  They now really want to make friends. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=520.04s)]
*  And this is actually a continuum of a policy that the Gulf countries have been following now for a number of years [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=522.2s)]
*  since the rapprochement between UAE, Saudi Arabia and Iran. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=529.08s)]
*  And the logic of it is that they don't like Iran, they don't like its politics, they don't like Hezbollah. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=534.12s)]
*  But they have come to the conclusion that, first of all, that the United States may not defend them if it comes to war. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=539.72s)]
*  That was what they learned when Iran attacked Saudi oil facilities in 2021. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=547.16s)]
*  And secondly, that any kind of a conflict in the Gulf would damage their economic models, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=552.96s)]
*  would damage the vision that they have for their economies, for their futures and what they are investing in. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=558.5600000000001s)]
*  So they don't want to be the target of Iranian attacks. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=564.6s)]
*  They also don't really want war in the region. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=567.84s)]
*  So in an ironic way, as tensions between Iran and the United States, Iran and Israel is going up. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=570.24s)]
*  The friendship between Gulf countries and Iran is going up in a commensurate way, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=576.76s)]
*  which tells you that the Gulf countries don't want to sign up to the strategy that Israel has with Iran [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=581.88s)]
*  and its proxies, which is to take the fight to them. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=587.44s)]
*  And if it comes to war, so be it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=590.32s)]
*  And they want to see a de-escalation, or at least they want to protect the Gulf from what might happen between Iran and Israel. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=592.6400000000001s)]
*  It's a risky strategy, but it's very clear that that's where they're going. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLnYJRTvEs&t=600.7600000000001s)]
