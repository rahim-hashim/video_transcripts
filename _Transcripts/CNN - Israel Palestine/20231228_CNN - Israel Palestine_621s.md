# Naked, handcuffed and blindfolded: Palestinian poet details time in Israeli custody
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso)
*  International calls for restraint are growing this morning after Israel has continued to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=0.0s)]
*  promise to continue its war against Hamas for quote, many more months. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=4.14s)]
*  Recently, Surfers video appears to show Palestinian men and at least two children stripped down [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=8.46s)]
*  to their underwear and detained by the IDF in Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=13.0s)]
*  CNN is unable to verify when the video was shot, but geolocation data shows it was filmed [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=16.0s)]
*  in a stadium of Gaza City. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=21.22s)]
*  The IDF has not responded to CNN's request for comment on that video. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=23.1s)]
*  The incident though, resembles an account shared by a Palestinian poet and writer, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=26.78s)]
*  Musab Abou Toa, in a new piece published in The New Yorker. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=30.42s)]
*  Abou Toa claims he was forced to completely undress at gunpoint before being detained [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=34.42s)]
*  and interrogated by the IDF earlier this month. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  He was trying to cross the Rafah border with his wife and three kids, including his three-year-old [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=41.7s)]
*  son Mustafa, who is a U.S. citizen. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=45.74s)]
*  Abou Toa said he was terrorized and beaten while being questioned about whether he had [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=48.28s)]
*  ties to Hamas. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=52.1s)]
*  A well-known poet and writer has studied at Syracuse and Harvard and denies repeatedly [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=53.62s)]
*  any ties to Hamas or terrorism. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=57.86s)]
*  The IDF gave a statement to CNN noting that it's a partial response and that they are [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=60.4s)]
*  still looking into the allegations, saying in part, during IDF operations in the Gaza [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=64.14s)]
*  Strip, a number of individuals were detained on the basis of intelligence indicating significant [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=68.78s)]
*  communications between them and terror organizations in the Strip out of suspicion of affiliation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=73.32s)]
*  with terror organizations there. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=78.86s)]
*  Musab Abou Toa was found to be mistakenly identified in this regard and was thus released [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=81.06s)]
*  after questioning. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=86.38000000000001s)]
*  The individuals detained are treated in accordance with international law. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=87.38000000000001s)]
*  Musab Abou Toa joins us now live from Cairo, Egypt. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=91.94s)]
*  We appreciate your time and I want to start with what the IDF says in their statement [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=95.10000000000001s)]
*  because what they don't discuss in the statement is what transpired between when you were detained [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=99.54s)]
*  and when they realized or came to the conclusion it was a mistake and you were released. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  You describe it in visceral detail in your piece. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=109.9s)]
*  Can you tell people what happened? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=112.98s)]
*  In part, I was called by description by an Israeli soldier who was about 150 meters away [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=139.9s)]
*  from the line. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=145.5s)]
*  He was asking me to drop my son and drop my backpacks and join the line of the other people [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=147.26000000000002s)]
*  who were called before. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  I was later called by name and then I was taken to another area with two Israeli soldiers [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=156.14000000000001s)]
*  pointing their guns at me and they were asking me to undress. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=162.3s)]
*  I took off all my clothes, my sweater and pants and then I only had my boxer shorts [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=165.86s)]
*  on and then the two soldiers were looking at each other and chatting in Hebrew and then [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=170.22s)]
*  he said continue, take off the boxer shorts. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=175.22s)]
*  And then I looked at the other person next to me, the Palestinian person next to me, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=179.54s)]
*  he was also detained with me and we were surprised that they are asking us to strip of all our [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=183.26s)]
*  So we had nothing to do but to take off our boxer shorts. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=192.02s)]
*  And then when I was naked for the first time in my life in front of strangers, I was asked [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=196.38000000000002s)]
*  to turn around. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=202.34s)]
*  So I did what they asked for and then I was handcuffed and I was blindfolded and then [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=205.3s)]
*  I was taken to a very close area and I was interrogated. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=212.18s)]
*  I introduced myself in English and I asked them to listen to what I'm saying. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  I was just returning to Gaza 10 days before October 7th and I told them everything about [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=222.02s)]
*  me. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=229.5s)]
*  And then he said you are a Hamas activist and we stopped your wife and three children. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=230.5s)]
*  So he was threatening me with my family. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=234.02s)]
*  They stopped my wife and three children at the next checkpoint. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  I told him do you have any evidence, any proof that I am a Hamas activist or a photograph, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=239.66s)]
*  a video, a satellite image showing anything and then he slapped me across the face. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=245.46s)]
*  He said you give me a proof. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=248.7s)]
*  And I was wondering how could I give you a proof that I am not Hamas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=250.74s)]
*  And then I was beaten, I was violently treated along with other young people like me and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=255.7s)]
*  there was someone next to me he was crying and said please I want to go back to my pregnant [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=264.14s)]
*  wife and my little daughter. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=268.78s)]
*  So that was part of my day during the first day. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=272.86s)]
*  And then I found myself in an Israeli detention center. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  Later I knew it was Beir Sheva or Beir Saba. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=283.62s)]
*  And later I was interrogated by an Israeli captain. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=287.5s)]
*  I told him about myself, everything and it was not a tough day for me but for other people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=290.9s)]
*  it was tough. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=296.34s)]
*  And then he said okay we are going to verify the information you gave us. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=297.86s)]
*  And then two hours later an Israeli soldier said we are sorry about the mistake you are [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=302.1s)]
*  going home. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=306.7s)]
*  And then I said are you serious about that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=308.62s)]
*  I'm going to be with my family and kids and he said I'm serious. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=312.62s)]
*  And then I later thought to myself how many mistakes have the Israeli army committed against [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=316.02s)]
*  other Palestinians? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=321.42s)]
*  And I thought that my quick release was I think was a result of the pressure that was [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=322.86s)]
*  put by major news outlets, the New Yorker, other medias. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=329.42s)]
*  But I'm thinking about there are many hundreds of other people like me who are innocent, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=335.42s)]
*  who have been living in Gaza, who have been unable to leave Gaza to study or to visit [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=339.42s)]
*  their relatives, etc. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=345.3s)]
*  Who have been born in Gaza during a hellish situation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=347.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  And these people do not have friends like I had. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=352.86s)]
*  So this has to end. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=355.54s)]
*  This is what I think. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  To that point you published a public letter to President Biden on Christmas writing quote [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm not asking you in this letter to impose a two state solution nor am I asking for the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=363.7s)]
*  bringing back the lives of the children and their families. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm asking you as a power to impose a ceasefire for peace and for children and for humanity. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=370.17999999999995s)]
*  When you look at the responses of world leaders up to this point what do you think has been [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=375.38s)]
*  missing? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=378.78s)]
*  Well I mean what is missing is that they are not listening to what the people in the world [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=382.5s)]
*  are asking for. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=387.22s)]
*  Many people went out in the streets and they asked for a ceasefire not because they want [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=388.62s)]
*  Hamas but because they want to save the lives of the children in Gaza. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=392.3s)]
*  I think this war is not against Israel and Hamas. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=395.86s)]
*  It's a war between Israel and the people in Gaza. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=398.38s)]
*  If you look at their numbers there are about 21,000 people who have been killed, half of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=402.82s)]
*  them children. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=408.42s)]
*  And there is one thing that is missing in this discourse. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=409.54s)]
*  Half of the population in Gaza there are more than 2 million people. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=412.58s)]
*  Half of them are children. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=416.38s)]
*  So after each airstrike, after each artillery shelling, half of the people who are killed [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=417.73999999999995s)]
*  are children not to mention the mothers etc. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=423.26s)]
*  So they need to stop this war to protect the children and then to find a just solution [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=426.46s)]
*  to the Palestinian case. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=431.34s)]
*  It's not only about October 7th. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=432.7s)]
*  I was wounded when I was 16 in 2009 and no one ever talked about that. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=434.41999999999996s)]
*  And I lost a lot of friends in my childhood. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=439.29999999999995s)]
*  But no one talks about this. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=444.46s)]
*  I mean it didn't start two months ago or three months ago. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=445.62s)]
*  It's been going for a long time and we need to find a just solution to the Palestinian [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=448.5s)]
*  case. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=453.41999999999996s)]
*  There's a line in your story that really stood out to me. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=454.41999999999996s)]
*  You wrote that as the details began to emerge on October 7th, quote, some Gazans seemed [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=457.14s)]
*  excited and happy about the attack, but many of us were perplexed and scared. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=461.26s)]
*  Although Gaza has been devastated by in your words Israeli occupation, I could not justify [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=465.53999999999996s)]
*  the atrocities committed against Israeli civilians. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=469.62s)]
*  There's no reason to kill anyone like that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=472.34s)]
*  When you look to the future, you've been talking about it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=474.66s)]
*  What is your sense of what Gazans want in the future? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=477.94s)]
*  Do people want Hamas to be involved in governance going forward? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  What is the future? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=483.86s)]
*  Well, the future, I mean the problem I think with Gaza is not about only Hamas. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean there are lots of issues. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=492.94000000000005s)]
*  There is the Palestinian local rift between Hamas and Fatah itself. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=494.86s)]
*  And Israel is benefiting from this political drift. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=501.14000000000004s)]
*  I mean what people in Gaza really want, they want to have peace. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=504.70000000000005s)]
*  They want to have their own airport, their own seaport. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=508.46000000000004s)]
*  They need to travel when they want, wherever they want. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=512.1800000000001s)]
*  They need to be respected outside of Gaza. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=515.22s)]
*  So we are not respected inside Gaza because we are being killed every time from the sea, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=516.9s)]
*  from the sky, from the land. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=521.46s)]
*  But we are not even respected outside of Gaza. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=523.22s)]
*  When you are trying to go to an embassy, for example, I tried to go to the American embassy [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=525.94s)]
*  in Jerusalem multiple times and the Israelis denied my permit. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=529.5799999999999s)]
*  And they don't want us to live in Gaza and they don't want us to leave Gaza to study [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=533.62s)]
*  or to learn about other people outside. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=537.9399999999999s)]
*  So people in Gaza are asking for jobs. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=540.74s)]
*  They are asking for a decent life. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=543.9s)]
*  They are asking to have their own border crossing, to control the border crossings in Gaza. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=545.4599999999999s)]
*  This has been one of my dreams as a child. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=552.38s)]
*  I still have dreams of seeing Gaza from a plane window. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=554.74s)]
*  And I still have dreams of seeing Gaza from a distant ship. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=560.22s)]
*  I need to see all these things. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=564.34s)]
*  But you are, I mean Israel continues to kill us, not during this war, but even before that. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=566.1s)]
*  So why people were concerned? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=572.62s)]
*  Because Israel has killed thousands of Palestinians without Hamas invading Palestinian neighboring [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=574.3000000000001s)]
*  towns and cities. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=579.46s)]
*  But now with the scene that we have seen on October 7th, I thought that Israel would have [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=581.62s)]
*  an excuse to kill more and more people and mostly children. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=588.02s)]
*  So children and civilians have been the victims for a long time. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=592.42s)]
*  Yeah, obviously the IDF says that they are responding in the October 7th attack and Hamas [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=598.22s)]
*  is intermingled with the civilian population. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=602.58s)]
*  But the scale of the death toll is certainly something that is not in dispute. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=604.94s)]
*  The IDF also saying they made a mistake when they detained you. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=608.62s)]
*  It is a very important personal story in the New Yorker, Massab Abut-Tawah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=611.94s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=615.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=616.3s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=618.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nju_fp_bCso&t=619.86s)]
