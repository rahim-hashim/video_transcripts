# Explosion interrupts interview with doctor in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A)
*  You were there on a routine mission, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=0.0s)]
*  a very important mission to take care of children. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=2.1s)]
*  Were you prepared at all for this? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=5.24s)]
*  Well, whenever you go to Gaza, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  you always know that there's danger of some violence [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=9.92s)]
*  while you're there, but no, I wasn't. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=12.42s)]
*  Well, I'm sorry, I'm prepared for this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=14.58s)]
*  Let us know if you need to go into some sort of bomb shelter [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=19.78s)]
*  or whatever, because I can hear those explosions [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=22.92s)]
*  going off right near you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=24.86s)]
*  There are no bombs shelters here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=27.42s)]
*  Is there any safe area that you can go to? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=30.64s)]
*  Yeah, actually I have a sister-in-law that's Palestinian. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=33.14s)]
*  She tells me to stay away from the windows, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=35.8s)]
*  so I'm away from the window, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=37.88s)]
*  stay by corners of walls that are more fortified, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=39.44s)]
*  and open your mouth so your eardrums don't break [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=42.42s)]
*  if there's a lot of pressure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=48.46s)]
*  So I'm following her advice, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  and I'm in a safe part of the room. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Uz5HZ-F5A&t=52.32s)]
