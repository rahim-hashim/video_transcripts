# Family members of hostages held in Gaza desperate to be reunited
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE)
*  Thank you so much for joining us. I'm so sorry for what you're dealing with. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=0.0s)]
*  All nine family members were taken by a mass. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=6.32s)]
*  Two have been released, three killed. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=11.56s)]
*  How are you coping? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=15.64s)]
*  Coping is a really big word. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=17.68s)]
*  I think each and every day I wake up and I just start doing everything I can. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=21.0s)]
*  Everything in my power to try to bring them back in any means necessary. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=30.0s)]
*  Two of your family members were released. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=35.64s)]
*  Judith and her teenage daughter, Natalie, Renan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Describe the moment when you saw those two family members walk across the border from Gaza. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=43.72s)]
*  They've been through hell. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=51.84s)]
*  They got back in the same clothes that they were kidnapped in. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=55.96s)]
*  We were relieved by their release and thankful for the American administration and President Joe Biden for the efforts to bring them back. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=60.04s)]
*  It gave us a lot of hope for returning the other family members and all the other hostages. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=71.92s)]
*  Have they spoken to you about those weeks in captivity? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=78.52s)]
*  We spoke a lot. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=82.76s)]
*  What has been said in these conversations are between us. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=86.08s)]
*  We're just happy to have them back. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=90.12s)]
*  And with that, we don't have the privilege to celebrate as well as the privilege to mourn our dead family members, which was buried through these days. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  I can't allow myself to really open myself to feel something because it can break me down. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=108.72s)]
*  And I really need to keep going every second until they're all back. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  Of all the family members that have been taken hostage by Hamas, the youngest is just three years old. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=126.36s)]
*  What are your hopes for the coming days, the coming weeks in terms of getting news of your loved ones? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=134.96s)]
*  When you see the innocence of someone who has her, literally her whole life ahead of her, and then you try to imagine where she is now under a tunnel at gunpoint. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=142.36s)]
*  She's three years old. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=160.2s)]
*  We are at the point that any news is good news. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=162.48s)]
*  We hope for any sign of life. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=167.48s)]
*  Sheneik, your cousin, Reymon, and her husband Yagiv were captured by Hamas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=170.68s)]
*  What do you know about what happened to them? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=179.48s)]
*  My cousin got into a safe room and at seven in the morning, she started to say, I'm going to go to the hospital. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=182.28s)]
*  She started to say that she sees terrorists outside of her window. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=189.28s)]
*  The kibbutz is built line by line. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=194.16s)]
*  The houses are lined by line. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=196.8s)]
*  So she saw them moving line by line using explosives, yelling, shooting. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=197.96s)]
*  So at eight twenty five in the morning, she texted her mum and said, Mum, they're shooting at us. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=207.36s)]
*  The window is shattered. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=216.4s)]
*  She then left her mum a voice message at eight thirty in the morning. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=218.4s)]
*  She told her that she loves her. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=223.4s)]
*  She loves her dearly and she's sorry she's not there with her. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=225.4s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=230.4s)]
*  And at three thirty, when the army reigned control in the kibbutz, they found the house. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=232.4s)]
*  Glass shattered. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=239.4s)]
*  Bullet holes, signs of struggle, some blood and they were gone. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=241.4s)]
*  And Shanique, Hamas has released a video of your cousin pleading for a ceasefire. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=248.4s)]
*  We're not going to show that video, but I would like to gauge your reaction upon seeing that and hearing what she said. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=256.4s)]
*  So first and foremost, thank you for not showing it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=263.4s)]
*  Secondly, when I saw the video, my first reaction was to smile because she's alive. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=268.4s)]
*  Just imagine for three weeks not knowing over three weeks now, not knowing if she's a lava dead, not knowing that she's alive. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=280.4s)]
*  Over three weeks now, not knowing if she's a lava dead, not knowing if she's well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=289.4s)]
*  Several hostages have been released or rescued. Does that give you hope? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=295.4s)]
*  It's a very tricky question because I have hope. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=302.4s)]
*  I've had hope for the past three and a half weeks, but we're dealing with a terror organisation. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=309.4s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister has said, has rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying now is the time for war. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=317.4s)]
*  Qatar, which is negotiating hostage releases, has said that would jeopardise our negotiations. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=323.4s)]
*  What do you think about that risk? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=331.4s)]
*  I plead and even demand that anyone who has any influence on this matter put the hostages on the first priority. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=334.4s)]
*  The community that was affected the most on October 7th was a community that fought the most for coexistence and believed in peace. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=347.4s)]
*  And did everything in their power to push for it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=355.4s)]
*  We are peaceful people. We want peace. We don't want revenge. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=359.4s)]
*  If I can turn to you, Ilan, your sister-in-law Aviva and her husband Keith, aged in their 60s, grandparents, taken hostage by Hamas. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=363.4s)]
*  What can you tell us about them? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=376.4s)]
*  Aviva has dedicated her life to the kindergarten caretaker. She takes care of babies. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=378.4s)]
*  Her life is family. My wife Sandy says all the time that if Aviva is in Gaza and if she's taking care of babies, she's going to be okay. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=391.4s)]
*  Because that's her life. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=404.4s)]
*  Keith is just one of these very friendly, he comes to any place he comes says hello to everyone. He's just super friendly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=406.4s)]
*  Both of them are just gentle people. It's the last thing I would ever imagine for them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=417.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for sharing your stories and I really hope that you are reunited with your loved ones very soon. Thank you. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX7tBAfy8XE&t=424.4s)]
