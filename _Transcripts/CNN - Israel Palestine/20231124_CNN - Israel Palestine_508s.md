# Hear what a retired US colonel thinks Hamas will do during truce
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E)
*  Right now I want to bring in retired US Air Force Colonel Cedric Layton for some serious analysis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=0.0s)]
*  Colonel, thanks so much for joining us. What do you expect Hamas to do during this brief pause in fighting? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=5.04s)]
*  Wolf, I think what they're going to do is they're going to move their forces around. They're going [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=13.68s)]
*  to try to avoid detection by the Israelis and that speaks to the cessation of drone flights. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Hamas is going to take advantage of that because of this surveillance picture. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=25.92s)]
*  That part of the surveillance picture at least will be lacking for the Israelis. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=30.0s)]
*  So Hamas is going to take advantage of that. They're also going to deploy their forces [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  in a way that will allow them to potentially ambush Israeli forces. Now, they've got some [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=38.56s)]
*  serious challenges on the Hamas side because Israel is sending a lot of airstrikes their way, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=43.84s)]
*  a lot of artillery strikes as well. And what that's doing is it's kind of forcing Hamas back [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=50.32s)]
*  from the northern area of Gaza. So with all of that in mind, what you're seeing is a consolidation [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  of forces on both sides with the preponderance of Israeli force right now concentrated in the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  north of Gaza and then potentially moving into the central part for a push once more into Gaza City. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=70.88s)]
*  The other hand, Hamas is going to try to keep as much of Gaza City as they possibly can [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=78.32s)]
*  and they're certainly going to try to keep their tunnels active as well. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=82.96s)]
*  Colonel, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant says he expects the fighting against Hamas to last, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=88.32s)]
*  in his words, at least another two months. Do you see that as being enough time for Israel [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=94.32s)]
*  to accomplish its objective of completely destroying Hamas? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=100.0s)]
*  Not really, because destroying Hamas would require not only a military victory, but also a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=103.52s)]
*  psychological and political victory. That is something that I don't see happening because at [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=112.32s)]
*  this particular point in time you have two very hostile populations pitted against each other, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=118.96s)]
*  and Hamas is very determined to keep its power base in Gaza as long as it can. And the Israelis, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=124.88s)]
*  of course, are equally determined to uproot them, but Hamas has basically got the upper hand when [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=132.88s)]
*  it comes to the hearts and minds, to use that overused term, of the Gazan people. Although they [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  have had basically less than majority support before October 7, right now I think their support [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=144.56s)]
*  has increased and that is going to also impact the way in which Israel has to conduct this war. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=151.2s)]
*  So it's going to take more than two months if they want to complete that goal of destroying Hamas. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=156.8s)]
*  Retired Colonel Cedric Leighton, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=162.96s)]
*  You bet, Wolf. In just a few hours from now, the first hostages being held by Hamas could be on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=167.44s)]
*  their way home. So what will that transfer process actually look like? Obviously it's going to be [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  quite complicated, but where do these women and children who are expected to be the first ones [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=177.84s)]
*  out of Gaza, out of Hamas's captivity, where do they go? Joining me now is the former FBI agent [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=182.72s)]
*  Robert D'Amico, who has worked on hostage cases overseas and his career is obviously the best [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=188.88s)]
*  perspective on this. And Rob, let's just start with how much of a test do you think that the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=195.12s)]
*  first day here is going to be for future swaps? Oh, it's huge. As I call this a moment of trust, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=199.68s)]
*  you don't have to have trust on either side of it, but during the actual exchange you have to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=210.16s)]
*  trust each other quite a bit. It's complex. There's so many things that could go wrong, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=214.4s)]
*  even without any ill effect on either side. If you have a faction not wanting to happen, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=219.52s)]
*  we've tried to do hostage exchanges and even couldn't find them with the helicopter and trying [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=225.76s)]
*  to narrow it down before weather came in. But this one's going to take a lot of trust to move that [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=231.12s)]
*  many people through an area that's a part of war. Hamas isn't going to want them to be able to be [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  tracked where they came from. I'm sure they'll come to a central point where they gather them [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=243.76s)]
*  and then move them to a point that they've agreed on. And same thing with the Israeli prisoners [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=249.2s)]
*  that are going to be coming out. But it is a tremendous task and the first one is going to be [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  extremely difficult. A lot of heightened tension on either side. It will go down a bit with each [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=260.96s)]
*  one. But even as small as error between them can have that spin out of control as far as losing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=267.84s)]
*  trust. How much does it hurt that it's not a direct line of communication between Israel and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=274.79999999999995s)]
*  Hamas? I mean, this is all being mediated through the Qataris. So I've done a couple of these. One, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=282.32s)]
*  actually, I ended up having, I was going through a senior Qatari that we're again moving some [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=290.96s)]
*  military folks to recover a prisoner held by the Taliban. And it got so complicated that the Qatari [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=297.12s)]
*  had to flip his cell phone. So I was talking straight to the Taliban commander because we [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=304.16s)]
*  couldn't find them. We had to lower the predator to look for them. And then they thought we're [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=309.36s)]
*  going to shoot them. They had machine guns. So thank goodness we had some communication [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=313.92s)]
*  to talk each other down. The second one, almost four years ago today, November 2019, we exchanged [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=318.88s)]
*  Professor King and Weeks, two professors that were kidnapped from Kabul, for the Haqqani 3. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=326.64s)]
*  And that one was a bit different. And we had to give our side up the three first before they even [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=333.2s)]
*  released theirs. And it got to one point we actually had a they're out going out to the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=339.84s)]
*  airplane. We had to pull them back at the last second because something fell through. It didn't [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=344.08s)]
*  hurt. We did it the next day. But it was still a complex scenario. There's so many middle people [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=349.84s)]
*  involved to get word back and forth. But that was through the Qatari's too. So again, the trust [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=356.0s)]
*  factor, the Qatari's talking to Hamas, us talking to Qatari's, since we've done it before with them, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=361.84s)]
*  I think that helps a bit. So what is if you're a hostage, and you are one of the first ones who is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=367.92s)]
*  being released, what does that reintegration period look like? I mean, obviously, they're [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=376.72s)]
*  going to need medical exams. They want to be reunited with their families. But I mean, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=381.92s)]
*  these are people who have been deeply traumatized for 47 days now. What does that look like? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=386.32s)]
*  Yeah, so it's the reintegration, we call it visa, bringing them back in, the first thing is medical. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=393.44s)]
*  So I'm sure with with this many at this one time that they're going to have something set up where [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=400.8s)]
*  they come in, and there's going to be a medical team for each person. I think the first [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=406.16s)]
*  are going to be 13 people don't know who don't know ages and stuff, but there's going to be [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=411.76s)]
*  a medical team, probably for each person. Along with that medical team is going to be hopefully [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=417.68s)]
*  a psychologist, the FBI has a psychologist under the victims assistance folks that usually comes [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  forward at least to a middle ground. We'd usually move them to Germany, where there's a whole team [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=430.08000000000004s)]
*  set up at the military base there in order to reintegrate them. And then the psychologist starts [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=435.04s)]
*  actually dictating what's allowed. We didn't even have agents or Intel folks talking to them without [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=441.44s)]
*  the psychologist there. Because of all the stress that they're going through, we want to get [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  information from them to help with other hostages and other things. But their physical and mental [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  health is more important. And that psychologist that's assigned to them is the one really [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=461.76s)]
*  dictating. I've seen some prisoners, I debriefed, he was actually Pakistani, and he'd been held for [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=466.88s)]
*  five years by the Taliban. I debriefed them for about five hours before we sent them back. And [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=474.08s)]
*  he had me laughing. I couldn't believe how much sense of humor he remained after five years. He [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=480.4s)]
*  had a great outlook. He was making jokes. And really coming around, that was incredible. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=486.08s)]
*  That is remarkable. I mean, your insight on this is so fascinating. And obviously, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=495.03999999999996s)]
*  we're thinking of all of these who are going to be released. Robert D'Amico, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  thank you for joining us and happy Thanksgiving. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving to you too. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5VpAKb0t1E&t=502.4s)]
