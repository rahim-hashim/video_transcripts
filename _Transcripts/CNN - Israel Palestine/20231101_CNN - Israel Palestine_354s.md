# 'Nobody can win a war like this': Jewish student reflects on Israeli-Hamas war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U)
*  The Cornell University student will appear in court after he was arrested and charged [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=0.0s)]
*  with threatening to kill and injure Jewish students. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=4.04s)]
*  According to court documents, the suspect posted at least one threat from the area where [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=7.12s)]
*  the university is located and also admitted to posting the threats in an interview with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=11.42s)]
*  the FBI. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=16.84s)]
*  CNN's Athena Jones, very late on this, she also sat down with a group of Jewish high [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=17.84s)]
*  school students about this terrifying and dangerous rise in anti-Semitism. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=21.38s)]
*  Athena, now that first and foremost after the arrest at Cornell, what is the latest [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=26.64s)]
*  that you're hearing? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=32.0s)]
*  Well, we know that this suspect, Patrick Dye, is expected to appear this afternoon in court. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=33.0s)]
*  They'll discuss his representation, whether he'll be able to be released on bail or not. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=36.6s)]
*  But this all comes as Jewish people all across America are concerned about the rise in anti-Semitism. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=42.0s)]
*  I sat down with five Jewish teenagers and concerns about anti-Semitism are the very [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=48.24s)]
*  first thing that came up in that discussion. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=53.0s)]
*  Another thing that really struck me immediately upon sitting down with them is just what a [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=55.94s)]
*  strong connection each and every one of them has to Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=58.94s)]
*  Each of them has family and friends there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=62.339999999999996s)]
*  They've gone multiple times to visit Israel over the course of their life. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=64.34s)]
*  They consider this a second home. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=67.3s)]
*  And they spoke about their concerns about how the war will impact their loved ones in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=69.22s)]
*  Israel, how it will affect their lives here in America, and how it will affect the world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=73.46s)]
*  It's a situation that hits close to home. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=80.46s)]
*  We're such a tight-knit community. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=82.66s)]
*  This is like our family. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=85.74000000000001s)]
*  It's this shock that's like consistent and you can't escape it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  I started reaching out to people to check up. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=91.66s)]
*  And it was hours later and I was still checking up on people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=94.78s)]
*  And there were still more people to reach out to and talk to and people that I was really [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=96.98s)]
*  worried about. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=101.26s)]
*  What have the last few weeks been like being here in America, observing what's going on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=102.62s)]
*  in Israel and Gaza? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=107.66s)]
*  I think it's been this sort of balancing act of worrying about like when's the other shoe [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=109.14s)]
*  going to drop here in America and caring for and like making sure to be a good support [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=116.05999999999999s)]
*  system for like my friends and family in Israel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  Waiting for the other shoe to drop? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=123.58s)]
*  How do you mean? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  I feel like right now in America we're in kind of this grace period with Israel where [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  Israel was attacked and the general feeling towards Israel is still fairly positive and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=130.54s)]
*  that pity is not going to be there anymore. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=136.29999999999998s)]
*  And I think that that's when bad things are going to start happening in America to Jews. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=138.78s)]
*  I disagree with the fact that the majority of American sentiment is one of pro-Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=143.46s)]
*  or pity or sympathy. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=148.46s)]
*  I think now that Israel has been bombing Gaza and there have been attempts to get the hostages [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=149.66s)]
*  back and all that the military... [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=157.14s)]
*  They say the political response to the war has been upset, especially what they're seeing [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=161.98s)]
*  on social media. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=166.78s)]
*  It's a very I think inherent Jewish value in times of grief to sit in your pain and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=168.58s)]
*  sit in your discomfort and fast or in prayer in community and acknowledge what's going [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=173.74s)]
*  on and that's our way of dealing with grief and processing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=178.62s)]
*  And I think to have such raw pain be turned into something political is very, very difficult [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=182.10000000000002s)]
*  to deal with. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=188.82000000000002s)]
*  It's an impossible situation when you've been attacked by this terror group that's also [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=189.82000000000002s)]
*  governing and hiding behind its own people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=194.54s)]
*  I can't watch innocent Palestinians die, but it's like you poke a bear and Hamas poked [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=197.38s)]
*  a bear and then went and hid behind a bunch of little cubs. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=205.34s)]
*  It's hard for me to hear free Gaza, free Palestine because that's... [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=210.26s)]
*  Hamas is hurting Gazan citizens just as much as it's hurting Israeli citizens. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=215.14s)]
*  Being pro-Palestine or pro-Gaza should not mean being pro-Hamas. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=221.46s)]
*  How do you think this ends? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=226.34s)]
*  When you're working on the amount of precedent that there is with Israel, with Gaza, with [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=227.78s)]
*  the Palestinians, with Hamas, I don't foresee this ending in a way that will feel very final. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=233.74s)]
*  Israel has lost. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=239.3s)]
*  The innocent civilians in Gaza have lost. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=240.86s)]
*  Nobody can win a war like this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  And so what does the end look like? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=247.86s)]
*  It looks like loss. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=250.46s)]
*  Where do you find the hope in a situation like this? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=251.86s)]
*  I have no hope that this conflict will be resolved in the next century, like not at [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=254.66s)]
*  all. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=258.58s)]
*  I think this will be an almost immutable fact of the Middle East, Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=259.58s)]
*  This is where I turn to religion and prayer, God, and really the core of Judaism, and that's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=265.74s)]
*  helping me get through this. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=273.98s)]
*  Francis Geller was planning to spend a gap year in Israel before going to college. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=275.14s)]
*  The plan is now uncertain. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=279.86s)]
*  I truly believe that perseverance is in our DNA. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=281.82s)]
*  We've been around for all this time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=285.38s)]
*  They try to get rid of us. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  They won't. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  And how can you not believe that that's who we are? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  Hopefulness and fighting, it's undeniable. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=293.7s)]
*  So a really powerful and important conversation with these teenagers. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=299.14s)]
*  And another thing that struck me from this conversation is this overwhelming desire to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=302.3s)]
*  help. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=306.26s)]
*  One young man said that his best friend, and they lived parallel lives until his best friend's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=308.26s)]
*  family moved to Israel, and now his best friend is in a few months going to be joining the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=315.46s)]
*  Israeli military. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=319.38s)]
*  And here he is in America feeling like he can't really do much. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=320.38s)]
*  So a lot of feelings of helplessness and guilt consuming them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  Just to reinforce, these are high school students. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=327.98s)]
*  I'm just amazed at their eloquence and their ability to put voice to the complexity of [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=330.54s)]
*  the pain and what they're living through, but also knowing that this started with a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=338.58000000000004s)]
*  terror attack coming from Hamas. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=343.18s)]
*  But my God, John. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and also living with the fear now that they feel increasingly under threat, I will [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=346.70000000000005s)]
*  say. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=351.14000000000004s)]
*  Athena, terrific job. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=352.14000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=353.14000000000004s)]
*  Thanks, Athena. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPNVq3BXy-U&t=354.14000000000004s)]
