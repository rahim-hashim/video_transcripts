# Ex-CIA director has a warning about a potential 'end result' in Israel-Hamas conflict
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw)
*  I want to bring in Leon Panetta, formerly the U.S. Secretary of Defense under President Obama. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=0.0s)]
*  Secretary Panetta, appreciate you being with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=4.68s)]
*  With so much violence and so much outrage about the attack that took place here starting Saturday morning, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=8.0s)]
*  the risk of obviously a wider war growing that might involve certainly other countries, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=15.84s)]
*  I'm wondering what you make of the situation that we are in right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, these are horrific events. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=29.12s)]
*  And the barbaric killing that went on by these terrorists is just hard to believe, hard to imagine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=34.96s)]
*  And I understand kind of Israel's reaction to this. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=46.24s)]
*  We had the same reaction after 9-11. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=52.56s)]
*  We were going to go after the terrorists who were involved in 9-11, and we did. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=55.68s)]
*  It took a while, but we ultimately got those terrorists. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=60.32s)]
*  And Israel is facing the same decision right now in terms of going after Hamas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=64.16s)]
*  Now, the numbers are a lot larger. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=70.64s)]
*  They've got to be, they'll be concentrated. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=72.88s)]
*  A lot of them will be in Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=75.6s)]
*  It's not going to be easy, but it's understandable that Israel wants to go after those who have been engaged [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=77.52s)]
*  in this horrific, horrific barbarism that they've witnessed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  One of obviously the complicating factors in any ground operation in Gaza and even in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  barbarism of Gaza that we've witnessed, there's the civilian population there, more than two million people there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=99.92s)]
*  There are many people living in Gaza who do not like Hamas but are powerless to stop them. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=105.44s)]
*  Is there any chance you believe that Egypt would agree to allow large numbers of civilians from [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=112.72s)]
*  Gaza to cross over the border? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=118.4s)]
*  And I mean, it seems, that seems highly unlikely given Egypt's refusal to do that in the past. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=120.72s)]
*  It's not likely. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=130.72s)]
*  Egypt might agree to some corridors, but you know, it's something they haven't agreed to in the past. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=131.84s)]
*  Look, this is a situation that I'm reminded of Colin Powell's warning in Iraq. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  I think he called it the pottery barn rule that if you break it, you're going to own it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=149.68s)]
*  You bought it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=158.0s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  You got it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=160.55999999999997s)]
*  And I don't think there's any question that if there's an invasion of Gaza, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=161.44s)]
*  that it's going to be tough. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=168.64s)]
*  It's going to be, you know, building to building, door to door, a lot of casualties. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=170.56s)]
*  And I guess my hope is that Israel is thinking about exactly what are their goals here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=177.27999999999997s)]
*  What do they want to achieve? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=184.16s)]
*  I know Netanyahu has talked about totally destroying Hamas, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=185.52s)]
*  but what are those goals they want to achieve? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=190.96s)]
*  And what does an endpoint ultimately look like? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=194.8s)]
*  Because if the end result is occupancy of Gaza, that's not going to be a pretty picture either. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  One of the reasons that this operation, this terror attack may have taken place at the time it did was [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  concerned by Hamas about Saudi Arabia making a deal in this region with with Israel, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  a normalization of relations. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=222.56s)]
*  Is that something that you think should move forward? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=226.24s)]
*  Hard to see how that might happen right now, but is that something you think is going to happen? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=229.52s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=234.24s)]
*  I think we still have to focus on how are we going to resolve the issues in the Middle East [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  between Palestine, the Arabs, and Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=250.72s)]
*  And it was a positive movement that we were developing the Abraham Accords [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=255.68s)]
*  and getting moderate Arab countries to join those accords and recognize Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  And that effort would have been climaxed in many ways if we were able to get Saudi Arabia [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=269.92s)]
*  to have been a part of the Abraham Accords, because that would have meant that the major [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  moderate nations, Arab nations, would have recognized Israel, and then they could all [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  have focused on the Palestinian issue and how to resolve that issue. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  So I hope that we, I know it's obviously not a good time now, but that we ultimately continue [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=295.59999999999997s)]
*  that diplomatic effort because ultimately, regardless of what happens with this war, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  the fact is we have got to find a peaceful solution to the issue of how Palestinians, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=309.76s)]
*  Israelis, and Arabs all live together. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56hhh0E-wMw&t=316.96s)]
