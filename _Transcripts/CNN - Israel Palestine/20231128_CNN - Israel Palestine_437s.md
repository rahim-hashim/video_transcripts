# Father of 9-year-old hostage reveals what daughter told him after her release
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck)
*  Nearly two months after being ripped from their homes and torn apart from their families, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=0.0s)]
*  freed hostages are returning to completely different lives in Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=4.28s)]
*  Some of them are waiting for other family members to be released. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=8.36s)]
*  Others are just learning for the first time that their loved ones were killed by Hamas. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=10.92s)]
*  Clarissa Ward spoke with one father, Thomas Hand. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=16.88s)]
*  You might remember him. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=19.44s)]
*  He initially thought that his daughter had been killed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=20.88s)]
*  He was actually grateful for it because of what he imagined Hamas might do to her. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=23.92s)]
*  Then he found out that she was alive. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=27.6s)]
*  And now nine-year-old Emily is home safe. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  And she is slowly sharing the details of what happened to her after she was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=34.2s)]
*  She said, Jess, you'll be here in a couple of minutes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=42.52s)]
*  I was like, oh, don't believe it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=44.08s)]
*  And all of a sudden the door opened up and she just ran. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=48.16s)]
*  It was beautiful, just like I imagined it, you know, running together. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=57.28s)]
*  I squeezed, I probably squeezed too hard. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=68.4s)]
*  It was a moment Thomas Hand thought would never come, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=72.56s)]
*  told his nine-year-old daughter Emily had been killed in the October 7th attacks, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=76.12s)]
*  then that she was believed to be held hostage in Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=81.44s)]
*  Finally, reunited with her family after 50 days in captivity, free but visibly haunted by her ordeal. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=85.92s)]
*  The most shocking, disturbing part of meeting her was she was just whispering. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=94.48s)]
*  I couldn't hear her. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=104.16s)]
*  I had to put my ear on her lips, like this close, and say, what did you say? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=106.16s)]
*  She said, I thought you were kidnapped. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=113.68s)]
*  She said, I thought you were kidnapped. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=117.68s)]
*  She thought I was in captivity. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=120.56s)]
*  And what has she told you about what she's gone through? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=124.4s)]
*  I thought she was in the tunnels, but she wasn't in the tunnels. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=129.28s)]
*  They were actually fleeing from house to house. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  She doesn't like it to be referred to as Gaza. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  She says the kufsa, the box. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=141.2s)]
*  So you have to say, how long were you in the box? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=144.0s)]
*  The kufsa. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=147.6s)]
*  She said a year. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=149.6s)]
*  Apart from the whispering, that was like a punch in the guts. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=156.64s)]
*  There's that one photograph right after your reunion. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  And you're holding her, and there is this sort of seriousness to her facial expression. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=169.68s)]
*  Yeah, she's almost staring, isn't she? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=177.2s)]
*  A little bit of a disconnect with everything going on around her. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=181.28s)]
*  Has she cried? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  Last night, she cried until her face was red and blotchy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=192.32000000000002s)]
*  She couldn't stop. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=199.12s)]
*  She didn't want any comfort. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=201.12s)]
*  I guess she's forgotten how to be comforted. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=203.12s)]
*  I just had to wait until she came out of it by herself. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=206.08s)]
*  And she knows how to do that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  She's a very determined little girl, very strong. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  I knew that her spirit would get her through it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=218.96s)]
*  There have been glimpses of the old Emily happily walking the family dog, Johnsy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  But many moments of pain, like when Thomas was forced to break the news to her that his ex-wife, Narquise, had been killed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=230.88s)]
*  Does Emily understand what happened on October 7th? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=238.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=243.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, she does. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=245.6s)]
*  How do you tell her, you know, your second mum is dead, killed, shot? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=247.6s)]
*  When we got back to the hospital, I asked the psychiatrist, you know, what do I do, what should I do? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=256.16s)]
*  She said, you've just got to tell her straight. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=262.16s)]
*  It's the best way. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=264.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=266.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=269.04s)]
*  That was very hard because we told her and, you know, her little eyes glazed up and she just went, took a sharp, sharp inbreath and take a breath. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=271.04s)]
*  Terrible thing to tell a child. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=285.04s)]
*  They recommend that you have to close the book. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=289.04s)]
*  Sounds cruel, but you have to stop that hope. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=293.92s)]
*  So you've got to stop that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=297.92s)]
*  It has to be final. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=301.92s)]
*  Our kiss is dead. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=303.92s)]
*  And so what is the next step now? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=307.92s)]
*  How long do you stay here? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=311.92s)]
*  How do you start a new life? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=313.92s)]
*  The future is obviously get Emily back to health and we will do that along the way. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=318.8s)]
*  But the next thing is along the way is that we have to get all the children, obviously. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=324.8s)]
*  All the women, all the men, all the hostages have to come back. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=330.8s)]
*  They have to be brought back. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=336.8s)]
*  Now, Jake, you heard Thomas talking about getting Emily back to health. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=338.8s)]
*  She is in good physical condition. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=345.68s)]
*  There's no indication that she was physically abused in any way. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=347.68s)]
*  She lost a lot of weight. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=351.68s)]
*  She was very, very pale. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=353.68s)]
*  She said that they didn't have enough to eat. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=355.68s)]
*  But obviously there is the psychological component here. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=357.68s)]
*  The very fact that she was only able to whisper because she's so frightened of raising her voice. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=361.68s)]
*  He said that the only word she appeared to learn in Arabic was the word for be quiet, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=367.68s)]
*  which gives you an indication of the fear that she was living through. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=372.56s)]
*  He also talked about how she has very bad head lice. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=376.56s)]
*  But all things considered, she is in reasonably good health physically. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=380.56s)]
*  And one other important thing when he talks about bringing the hostages back, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=384.56s)]
*  he's very focused at the moment on the mother of Emily's very good friend, Hila. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=388.56s)]
*  This is the girl he had gone to the play date with. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=392.56s)]
*  She had gone to the play date, spent the night with, was kidnapped with, was held with. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=396.56s)]
*  He's talking about Hila's mother, Raya Rotem, who acted like a second mother to her. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=401.44s)]
*  And then inexplicably, at the last minute, two days before they were due to be released, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=405.44s)]
*  Raya was separated from Emily and Hila. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=409.44s)]
*  You can imagine Hila was released with Emily and the anguish that she is going through now [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=413.44s)]
*  being separated from her mother. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=419.44s)]
*  And this is a very important point for Thomas, he says, going forward. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=421.44s)]
*  We need to keep fighting for all the hostages, but particularly for Raya [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=425.44s)]
*  and try to get to the bottom of why it was that she was separated from her daughter [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=429.44s)]
*  just ahead of their release. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k808GLtoVck&t=435.44s)]
