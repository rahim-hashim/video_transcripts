# CNN anchor asks IDF spokesperson if airstrikes have accomplished all they can
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w)
*  Right now Israeli forces say they are conducting a significant operation including strikes against Hamas targets in Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=0.0s)]
*  CNN team near the border capturing these images of flares [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=6.7s)]
*  Lighting up the night sky just a short time ago and join me now to discuss is IDF international spokesperson [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=10.08s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrikis Colonel. Thanks very much for your time [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  We've seen a lot of these explosions and fires last night and tonight. What can you tell us about what we're seeing? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=19.54s)]
*  What are these strikes going after? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=25.46s)]
*  War continues. Well, first of all, good evening. Thank you for having me war continues in Gaza [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=28.44s)]
*  We are striking Hamas and we are going stronghold after stronghold according to our plan in a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=33.8s)]
*  systematic effort to dismantle Hamas from its military capabilities in order to make sure that October 7 [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  never happens again [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  But specifically you can't tell us what the strikes are about at this point [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=51.28s)]
*  They are about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=54.86000000000001s)]
*  Underground infrastructure that Hamas has in various populated areas and we have troops on the ground [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=56.900000000000006s)]
*  Infantry armor combat engineers. They are striking and they are also directing fires from the air [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  According to intelligence that they have on the ground and intelligence that is being generated all in an effort to strike Hamas [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=72.58000000000001s)]
*  Militants and there was a special focus on Hamas commanders [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=79.9s)]
*  And the IDF also says that Israeli forces are ready to shift into an offensive mode at any moment [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=85.0s)]
*  on the northern border with Lebanon. Can you tell us about that? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=91.76s)]
*  Well, actually our posture along the Lebanese border has been very defensive [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=97.12s)]
*  We've only been responding to attacks from Hezbollah [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Today an Israeli civilian was killed when an anti-tank missile that was fired from Lebanon [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=106.0s)]
*  by Hezbollah at an Israeli [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=111.62s)]
*  community an Israeli civilian was killed and others were wounded and there's been rocket attacks in Kiryat Shmona [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=114.18s)]
*  We are deployed in significant strength and are ready to respond to any escalation coming from Lebanon [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=120.74s)]
*  and continue to warn the state of Lebanon and Hezbollah [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=128.74s)]
*  That it would not be in their interest to escalate the situation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=132.6s)]
*  And Colonel all weekend long we've seen images of carnage in Gaza [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=136.35999999999999s)]
*  The civilian death toll appears to be going up with every Israeli strike inside of Gaza [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=141.24s)]
*  I know you've said and your counterparts have said that you're not targeting civilians [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=148.04s)]
*  You're doing your best not to target civilians, but yet there are scores of civilian casualties [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=152.84s)]
*  I'm wondering at what point do you say these strikes have accomplished all that they can accomplish [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=157.9s)]
*  and you have to shift to a more ground-based offensive inside of Gaza to make sure that you're not causing [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=163.9s)]
*  an excessive number of civilian casualties [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=170.86s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I mean we have said and we will continue to say that we are not fighting against the civilian population [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=175.82s)]
*  They are not our enemy. Hamas is not our enemy [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=181.82s)]
*  And the sad reality and the reason behind all of this really sad footage that we see coming out of Gaza [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  It's not Israeli activity. It's the fact that Hamas systematically hides behind those civilians [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  You know there's an ongoing operation to try to evacuate Palestinian civilians from northern Gaza [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  More than 800,000 have already made the smart decision to do so [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  We've opened specific humanitarian corridors yesterday and today for the continued unhindered flow [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=210.34s)]
*  of Palestinian civilians south to safer areas [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=218.34s)]
*  There is water in the south, there is access to food and medicine in the south [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=222.34s)]
*  and it is definitely a safer and the safest area to be in the Gaza Strip [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=228.34s)]
*  and we continue to call on the population to move south [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=232.34s)]
*  We don't want them in the battlefield and we don't want them in harm's way [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=237.08s)]
*  We want Hamas to stand up and fight and we are going to take the battle to Hamas [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=241.08s)]
*  and we really hope that the civilian population won't continue to be held by Hamas as human shields [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=247.08s)]
*  And you say you want the civilians to move south so they're out of harm's way [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=253.08s)]
*  Why not take a humanitarian pause, facilitate that, help in that effort [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=259.82s)]
*  Why stand against that idea of a humanitarian pause right now? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=265.82s)]
*  Why not be open to something temporary so civilians can safely get out of these areas? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=269.82s)]
*  I totally agree and that's what I said. We've done that twice in two days [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=275.82s)]
*  Yesterday and today there were humanitarian corridors [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=279.82s)]
*  We opened up an area along Salah Hadin Road which is the main road [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=284.56s)]
*  and we told the Palestinians before, listen, between 10 and 2 there's going to be a pause [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=288.56s)]
*  and we will facilitate the free and unhindered movement from the north, south of Wadi Gaza [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=294.56s)]
*  so that you can be in relative safety [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=300.56s)]
*  Take your belongings, take your family and go. We have done this twice [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=302.56s)]
*  We have issued warnings and statements. It is exactly what we're doing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=306.56s)]
*  Okay, and forgive me for interrupting but I just want to make sure because the terminology is important to get right here [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=311.3s)]
*  Are you saying that the IDF did have what you consider to be a humanitarian pause this weekend [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=317.3s)]
*  as had been requested by the Biden administration or is this your own version of a humanitarian pause? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=324.3s)]
*  Can you just clarify that? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=331.3s)]
*  I will happily clarify. Yesterday and today for many hours with prior notice and warning [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=334.04s)]
*  we facilitated, we stopped firing in certain areas of northern Gaza which is the main combat area [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=342.04s)]
*  and we called on Palestinians to move south. Many did, not enough [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=349.04s)]
*  More than 800,000 have left northern Gaza which is good [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=353.04s)]
*  but we want all of the civilians to be out of harm's way [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=357.04s)]
*  and we did so not once but twice in order to facilitate more [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  The sad reality is that even these efforts were hindered by Hamas who started firing at the convoys and at Israeli troops in that area [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  and then unfortunately that humanitarian window was eventually closed [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  but the bottom line is I think that we don't only talk the talk but we actually do it on the ground [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  and we have for two days in a row facilitated safe access and safe transit of Palestinian civilians [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=385.52s)]
*  I understand it is underreported because perhaps it doesn't go according to the narrative [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=393.52s)]
*  but we are trying to get civilians out of the past [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=397.52s)]
*  That's why I'm trying to ask you and that's why I'm trying to ask to get that clarification [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=401.52s)]
*  and so are you saying that these humanitarian windows that were opened up over the weekend [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=404.52s)]
*  they meet to the satisfaction of the Biden administration what they were calling for [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=410.26s)]
*  and having some kind of pause to facilitate the movement of civilians out of harm's way [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=415.26s)]
*  Do you have confirmation from the Biden administration that okay thank you for doing that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=421.26s)]
*  or has it not reached that level yet? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=426.26s)]
*  I don't know exactly how the administration feels about it [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=429.26s)]
*  I know that we are doing real honest efforts to get civilians out of the battlefield [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=433.26s)]
*  and we are not only telling them where to go but we are also helping in creating much better humanitarian conditions in the south [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=440.0s)]
*  which is where we are telling people to go [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=446.0s)]
*  There is less combat there, there is access to water by the way from Israel as well [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=448.0s)]
*  we've opened the taps from our side and there is an inflow of goods [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=452.0s)]
*  more and more trucks humanitarian trucks come in every day to the south [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=456.0s)]
*  there is a humanitarian zone [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=460.0s)]
*  and at the end of the day it's the best thing for civilians to do [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=462.0s)]
*  and we are facilitating it [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=466.0s)]
*  because we want a battlefield where we can face Hamas and make sure that we engage them and them only [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=468.74s)]
*  and beat them on the battlefield to make sure that never again will they be able to attack Israel [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=474.74s)]
*  Alright Colonel Kounrikos, thank you very much for your time [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QMzPkn3M0w&t=479.74s)]
