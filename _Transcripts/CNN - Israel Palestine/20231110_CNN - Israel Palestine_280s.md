# See what Trump said about US involvement in Israel-Hamas war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4)
*  Former president Donald Trump now suggesting the U.S. should take a hands-off approach to the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=0.0s)]
*  Here's what he said during an interview with Univision on Thursday when asked how America might help stop the civilian killings in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=6.0s)]
*  So you have a war that's going on and you're probably going to have to let this play out. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=15.0s)]
*  You're probably going to have to let it play out because a lot of people are dying. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=19.0s)]
*  There is no hatred like the Palestinian hatred of Israel and Jewish people and probably the other way around also. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=23.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's not as obvious, but probably that's it too. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=34.0s)]
*  All right, let's bring in CNN's Max Foster, who is live from London. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=38.0s)]
*  Max, always wonderful to see you. Trump also said Israel needed to do a better job of public relations. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=43.0s)]
*  And he pointed to this rash of pro-Palestinian protests in the U.S. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=49.0s)]
*  And obviously earlier in all of this, he went after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for not being prepared. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=54.0s)]
*  What is your sense of what's going on here? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=62.0s)]
*  I think that clip, you know, if you move away from a lot of how he says it and specifically what he's saying and what he means, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=65.0s)]
*  which is what I try to do with Donald Trump when it comes to international policy, at least, is pretty significant. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=74.0s)]
*  What he's effectively saying is, you know, he doesn't see... [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=80.0s)]
*  If we look back at his previous tenure as well and how he played that out and what he's saying here about this Middle East crisis, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=84.0s)]
*  it's like he doesn't see America as that international policeman, which actually the rest of the world has relied on for decades and decades and decades. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=91.0s)]
*  So focusing more on American problems, which a lot of Americans will relate to, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=99.0s)]
*  but outside America, that does have a huge impact because you and I have spoken a lot about this new world order that China and Russia want to create. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=104.0s)]
*  America pulling back from the international stage and saying they're not going to get involved in like crises like the Middle East does create a vacuum. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=112.0s)]
*  And you know who's going to step into that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=120.0s)]
*  So it has huge repercussions, that little soundbite for me when I look at it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=122.0s)]
*  And if it does get into power, we're going to see, you know, America less present on the international stage, certainly militarily, it seems. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=127.0s)]
*  Yeah, it honestly is really, really interesting. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=135.0s)]
*  You know, I'm thinking about how Vladimir Putin is backing off of Israeli support for Israel that he previously had in the context of this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=138.0s)]
*  And Trump does have a way of picking up on things that are going on in the electorate and really putting his finger on things. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=145.0s)]
*  As uncomfortable of a reality as that might be, he does have a really strong nose for it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=151.0s)]
*  And it's interesting to me that this is what he's picking up. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=156.0s)]
*  Let's also, Max, talk about Nikki Haley, because in the Republican primary debate she did seem to gain more ground there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=158.0s)]
*  She's sort of becoming the person who is first in the race for second place. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=166.0s)]
*  But she did make this statement about Vivek Ramaswamy on the stage because the two of them really tangled. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=170.0s)]
*  Take a look at what she said. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=179.0s)]
*  I am telling you, Putin and President Xi are salivating at the thought that someone like that could become president. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=182.0s)]
*  They would love to see that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=189.0s)]
*  What's your takeaway from there? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=191.0s)]
*  I mean, what does the international community think of anything? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=194.0s)]
*  I mean, are these two known on the national stage? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=196.0s)]
*  What's the impression? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=198.0s)]
*  Well, you know, people that know about international policy certainly know about Nikki Haley. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=200.0s)]
*  She is this sort of towering figure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=204.0s)]
*  She's got a lot of experience and certainly stands out in that sense in the line-up with all the other candidates. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=206.0s)]
*  But if you're not into international policy, I don't think you necessarily know who she is. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=211.0s)]
*  People aren't watching these debates in big numbers at all here because Donald Trump isn't involved and they wonder why they're taking place. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=217.0s)]
*  They're not learning about her there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=225.0s)]
*  I think you really need to be looking at Ramaswamy if you're talking about international profile because he is a big deal on TikTok. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=227.0s)]
*  My kids will show me TikToks with him in them very regularly. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=234.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=238.0s)]
*  I mean, you never show me TikToks with Nikki Haley. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=239.0s)]
*  Let me just say that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=241.0s)]
*  I mean, in terms of profile, I would say he's the only person my kids and their friends will be able to pick out in that entire line-up apart from Trump. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=243.0s)]
*  That is wild and extremely, extremely interesting. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=251.0s)]
*  Vivek went after Nikki Haley's daughter over TikTok. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=255.0s)]
*  So the fact that people overseas know him for being on TikTok. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=258.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=263.0s)]
*  Well, it's not necessarily his own profile. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=264.0s)]
*  I mean, it is that as well. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=266.0s)]
*  It's also people just picking up clips from the debates and they're always about him and they're the ones that go viral over here. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=267.0s)]
*  I guess that is kind of what he set out to accomplish. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=274.0s)]
*  All right, Max Foster. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=277.0s)]
*  Thank you as always, my friend. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=278.0s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBtJMBIG-n4&t=279.0s)]
