# How Hamas won and kept control in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q)
*  Slick propaganda, a blatant threat, and published last year, Hamas gunmen training on motorized [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=0.0s)]
*  paragliders. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=9.96s)]
*  They also showed meticulous planning for fighting in built-up areas, all an historic failure [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=12.44s)]
*  of Israeli intelligence. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=17.900000000000002s)]
*  Hamas videos of the start of their assaults from Gaza were published within hours of its [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=21.28s)]
*  launch. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=25.76s)]
*  As a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, a Sunni movement, won Palestinian elections [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  in 2006 on a platform of social reform and resistance to Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=31.84s)]
*  Riven by corruption and incompetence, rivals Fatah launched attacks immediately against [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=38.160000000000004s)]
*  the movement, which denies the right of Israel to exist at all. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=42.96s)]
*  In the end, Hamas won control of Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=47.64s)]
*  And its grip on the enclave of around two million people tightened, as Israel and Egypt [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=51.66s)]
*  largely sealed it off, causing intense humanitarian problems. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=56.52s)]
*  Hamas responded with waves of rocket attacks against Israel that got worse as the years [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=61.6s)]
*  went by. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=66.36s)]
*  Israel counterattacked from the air and with ground assaults that left thousands dead, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=67.92s)]
*  and Hamas still in charge. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=74.68s)]
*  But Iran's influence has been key to Hamas' military power. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=76.76s)]
*  The Iranians have trained Palestinian engineers in how to establish rocket manufacturing in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=80.44s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=85.52s)]
*  We know that the Iranians have provided certain production equipment which you need for the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=86.52s)]
*  production of solid propellant rockets to Gaza and to other places as well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=91.52s)]
*  Israel knows it must battle Hamas on its own turf, in urban areas latticed with explosive [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  traps and riddled with secret tunnels. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=100.92s)]
*  And Hamas will draw on the experience of Iran-backed Hezbollah, which ravaged Israel's armor in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=104.0s)]
*  2006. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  All the while trying to protect the lives of at least 130 hostages that Hamas says they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=111.6s)]
*  will kill if Israel's attacks continue. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=116.8s)]
*  Dealing with violent groups, backed by Iran, a country that's bent on destroying Israel [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  and building a nuclear weapon that could do just that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=126.44s)]
*  Sam Kiley, CNN. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=130.64s)]
*  Some perspective now from New York Times foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman, who's been [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=135.92s)]
*  covering the region and writing about it since the 1980s, whose bestselling account [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=139.28s)]
*  from Beirut to Jerusalem is considered required reading for students in the Middle East. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=143.32s)]
*  Tom, why do you think this attack happened now? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=149.64s)]
*  Why did Hamas choose to strike now? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=153.0s)]
*  Was it divisions within Israel that they sensed, the looming Saudi deal? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=156.1s)]
*  I have to believe that the looming Saudi deal was a big factor in this because we're talking [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=162.36s)]
*  about something that would have been a fundamental geopolitical shift in the region. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=167.8s)]
*  Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel opens ties up between Israel and really the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=172.4s)]
*  rest of the Muslim world, possibly Indonesia, Malaysia. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=178.84s)]
*  It would be a huge strategic shift. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=182.04s)]
*  But more importantly, Anderson, it also would have had to have been done as part of a deal [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=184.04s)]
*  that would have, I think, strengthened the legitimacy of Hamas's archrival, the Palestinian [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=188.68s)]
*  authority in Ramallah, because that normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia could only [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=193.16s)]
*  have been done if Israel also made concessions to the Palestinian authority, giving it greater [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  control over certain areas in the West Bank, administrative control, putting some kind [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=202.68s)]
*  of freeze and settlements down, and basically reviving hopes for a two-state solution. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=207.28s)]
*  So I think both of those were in play. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  And at the same time, I think it sensed that Israel was completely distracted by a needless [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  judicial coup inside, and the two came together properly. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=220.24s)]
*  The big question, of course, about the level of Iran's involvement. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=226.44s)]
*  You know, U.S. officials say they haven't seen a smoking gun, but certainly Iran supports [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=229.88s)]
*  Hamas, Islamic jihad, certainly. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=234.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=237.64s)]
*  I mean, again, no one, I think, has a smoking gun, but at the same time, Iran's overriding [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=238.64s)]
*  interest in not seeing its two arch enemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, forge an agreement [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=244.56s)]
*  together, I think is really apparent there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=250.56s)]
*  Otherwise, the thing is even beyond being barbaric, even more senseless and stupid than [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=255.32s)]
*  it appears. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=262.88s)]
*  If Hamas just did this on some fling for no apparent reason other than had the resources, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=263.88s)]
*  it's now visited just tremendous destruction on itself, on Palestinians in Gaza, and maybe [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=271.08s)]
*  lost a strategic number of weapons that it will hopefully never be able to threaten as [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=278.64s)]
*  Israel again. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=285.12s)]
*  So I can only believe it has something to do with that Iran, with that Saudi-Israel [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=286.12s)]
*  normalization deal. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=290.76s)]
*  The Israeli government's called for a complete siege of Gaza. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=293.96s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu spoke today, did not specifically talk about a ground incursion, but certainly [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=298.48s)]
*  that would seem to be in the cards or certainly a strong possibility. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=304.04s)]
*  We all know that the difficulties of that, the inherent dangers in that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=309.96s)]
*  The international outrage that will grow as conditions deteriorate in Gaza and the civilian [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=315.04s)]
*  population suffers. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=324.04s)]
*  Israel risks a lot by a ground invasion, not just in blood of their people, their soldiers, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=327.48s)]
*  but also in actually being able to get what they want. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=335.48s)]
*  It can actually go in, it can actually play into the hands of Iran, can't it? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=341.4s)]
*  Well, you know, in these kind of moments, Anderson, I always ask myself, and I'm sure [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=346.12s)]
*  Israel is asking itself, I hope it is, what does my enemy want? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=351.47999999999996s)]
*  And then let's do exactly the opposite. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  So what do Israel's enemies want right now? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas, they want Israel to occupy Gaza, get enmeshed in a door-to-door, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=362.35999999999996s)]
*  house-to-house fighting there, kill a lot of Palestinian civilians, and completely erode [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=370.92s)]
*  the moral high ground that it has right now, which does have real value. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=377.6s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=381.52s)]
*  They don't care less about their people. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=383.76s)]
*  If they did, Hamas would have been governing Gaza in a completely different way. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=385.24s)]
*  I hope that Israel can achieve its goals of restoring its deterrence, getting its hostages [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=389.48s)]
*  back, but doing it in a way that is not going to play into the hands of Hamas. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=397.24s)]
*  These are hard calls, I recognize, but you don't want to underplay it, you don't want [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  to overplay it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=407.04s)]
*  But I hope Israel does not have to go into Gaza, or if it doesn't go far or deep. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=408.04s)]
*  Is it possible, though, for Israel to avoid going into Gaza? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=415.12s)]
*  I mean, if they want to stop Hamas' military capabilities moving forward from being able [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  to do the same kind of attack, what other option is there? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=424.72s)]
*  Well, I think that one of the things that Hamas has done, again, which sort of leaves [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=428.72s)]
*  you wondering what they were thinking, among many things, is that they've shown Israel [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=433.6s)]
*  every vulnerability it had in Gaza, and they did that for the purpose of inflicting 700, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=439.04s)]
*  800 civilian and military casualties on Israel. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=447.08s)]
*  But now where are you, Hamas? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=452.12s)]
*  How are you better off? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=454.08s)]
*  How are the Palestinians of Gaza better off? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=455.08s)]
*  But you've just shown Israel, and blessedly for Israel, that it had all these vulnerabilities. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=457.28s)]
*  The Israelis will study this, they will close them. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  Hamas has now fired off a lot of weapons, also shown Israel what new missile technology [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=466.52s)]
*  it had. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of things that Israel can achieve in the long run that will leave [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=473.2s)]
*  Hamas much more weakened without having to go in and try to reoccupy the place. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=478.36s)]
*  Because if not, maybe there's only one thing worse than Hamas controlling Gaza, and that's [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=484.32s)]
*  nobody controlling Gaza, or Israel having to control Gaza. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=489.48s)]
*  And so this problem hasn't been insoluble for so many years for a reason. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=493.32s)]
*  And I think this is a time for Israel to do deep thinking about how deep it gets in. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure they are, but I think this is really some critical decisions that have to be taken [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=504.88s)]
*  here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=510.88s)]
*  There are, I'm sure, plenty of civilians in Gaza who oppose Hamas, who don't like the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=513.72s)]
*  Hamas regime. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=521.0s)]
*  And yet, they don't really have anywhere to go. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=522.6s)]
*  The IDF will say go to other areas, but it is so densely packed, it is very difficult [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=527.56s)]
*  for civilians in Gaza. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=533.4s)]
*  And that's why, Anderson, some problems are kind of insoluble. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=536.76s)]
*  Unless Israel wants to completely occupy Gaza and nurture a completely different kind of [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=542.24s)]
*  Palestinian government there and stay there, probably multiple generations it would take, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=549.12s)]
*  it's going to have to deal with some form, most likely, of Hamas. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  I think the point is to put Hamas in a situation where it can never do this kind of attack [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  again, where it's on the defensive in international circles, and is deterred. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=566.64s)]
*  But I think deterrence is the only outcome here. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=573.36s)]
*  You're not going to remake Gaza. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, the notion of completely transforming that situation through military means, it's [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=579.96s)]
*  just not going to happen. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTHV_9KHs8Q&t=587.64s)]
