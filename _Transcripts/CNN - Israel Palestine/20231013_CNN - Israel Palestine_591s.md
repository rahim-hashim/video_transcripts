# Israeli troops have carried out local raids in Gaza, IDF says
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto)
*  I want to go back to Israel, CNN's Nick Robertson is live there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=0.0s)]
*  Nick, what are you learning? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=3.6s)]
*  Well, we've just learned from the Israeli Defense Force that they have put some [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=7.48s)]
*  troops across the border into Gaza in the past 24 hours. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=11.84s)]
*  They call it a local, a local, looking for the language here, exactly, a local raid. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=17.16s)]
*  So a limited incursion, a local raid is a language they use to describe the troops [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=27.64s)]
*  that they've sent across into Gaza. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=33.44s)]
*  It's not clear how many they've sent across. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=35.8s)]
*  It's not clear yet what their mission was. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=38.6s)]
*  It's not clear yet if their mission was successful. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=41.36s)]
*  It's not clear yet if they had any casualties. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=44.2s)]
*  But this is the first time since the weekend, since this big buildup of forces [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=47.24s)]
*  that we've heard from the IDF that they have in fact sent troops inside the Gaza strip. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=52.64s)]
*  This, they say, was over the past 24 hours. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=59.6s)]
*  The indication seems to be that this was limited and the indication seems to be that it [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=63.12s)]
*  is over now, that those troops are out. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=70.56s)]
*  And that would perhaps be within the sort of expected operational parameters for something [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=72.68s)]
*  like this, that the IDF would not announce something like this while they had forces [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=77.56s)]
*  over the border inside of Gaza itself. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=82.56s)]
*  It really is interesting that they did make this public. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  And you said very clearly that we don't know what the mission is right now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=91.44s)]
*  I mean, you would think it might be twofold. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=96.24s)]
*  One is to try to get hostages. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=98.16s)]
*  Another is that they located some of the terrorists or some of the higher ranking officials [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=100.28s)]
*  in Hamas they are looking for. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  But what does it tell you that we know this information right now? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=109.0s)]
*  There's another thing to add to that mix of what it might be as well. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=118.28s)]
*  It might be going in to recover bodies. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  It might be going in to recover soldiers who died over the weekend and have been on the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=126.2s)]
*  other side of the fence. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  It could be as simple as that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=135.16s)]
*  But what it speaks to, what it speaks to is that Israel is more and more on a footing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=137.52s)]
*  where it can go into this very dangerous area for troops and be ready to protect itself [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=144.36s)]
*  and carry out a mission. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=150.76s)]
*  And it's indicative that there will be more missions like this to come. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=151.72s)]
*  I think until we get the details of precisely what it was, if it was more than just, let's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=155.36s)]
*  say, a body recovery, then that will tell us that they're really on a forward footing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=160.0s)]
*  at the moment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=167.16s)]
*  Thank you so much for that, Nick. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=168.96s)]
*  I want to bring back Colonel Cedric Leighton, who will hopefully continue to give us a bit [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=170.28s)]
*  of perspective on what Nick just reported. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=176.0s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=179.68s)]
*  So, Dana, the key indicator here is that this was a series of small raids. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  In every single one of the options you talked about, you know, possibly a hostage recovery [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  mission, possibly the business about going after the senior leadership of Hamas and or [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=191.08s)]
*  the recovery of the remains of dead Israeli soldiers. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=197.28s)]
*  All of those are possibilities. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=202.0s)]
*  I am thinking it's either number one or two at this point. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=203.68s)]
*  In essence, what they're looking for is would be a perfect thing for Israeli intelligence [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=207.68s)]
*  to recover its lost luster in the wake of the debacle on the strategic front if they [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=212.94s)]
*  have a good tactical intelligence success, where their special operations forces come [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=220.68s)]
*  in and they actually have a successful mission. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=225.0s)]
*  Of course, we don't know yet whether or not the mission has been successful. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=228.94s)]
*  We have no idea, you know, what the actual targets were. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=232.68s)]
*  But it seems as if this is the kind of mission where special operations forces would go in [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=236.84s)]
*  and have very finite targets that would go in and they would be able to take actions [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=242.32s)]
*  on them and meet limited objectives in that way. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=250.24s)]
*  Colonel, I'm just being told in my ear that the IDF says that they were in fact searching [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  for hostages as part of this raid. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=259.44s)]
*  We do not know if that was successful. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  Again, what does that tell you as a former intelligence officer? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=264.76s)]
*  So the likelihood is very high that we might be disappointed with the outcome of this, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=268.2s)]
*  Dana, because of the way in which Hamas operates. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=272.88s)]
*  But we could see hopefully some success. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=276.20000000000005s)]
*  But I don't want to give anybody any false hope at this point in time. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=280.12s)]
*  It's very early in this, the IDF, if things are successful. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=284.32s)]
*  At some point, the IDF is clearly going to announce that they have rescued hostages. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  And of course, that would be a big political as well as military victory for the Israelis. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=294.6s)]
*  And it would also clear the way for further incursions from an operational standpoint [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=299.48s)]
*  on the military side, further incursions of a more conventional nature if they choose [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=304.76000000000005s)]
*  to do them into Gaza. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=309.56s)]
*  So that, you know, we're kind of in this environment now. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=311.68s)]
*  If this was a hostage rescue mission or trying to find out where the hostages are, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=314.72s)]
*  that would be a classic special operations mission. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=319.96s)]
*  And it would be something that would have a high payoff for the Israeli political [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=322.68s)]
*  and military leadership. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=328.2s)]
*  More on that breaking news into CNN. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=330.0s)]
*  The Israeli defense forces say they have carried out some raids in the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=332.2s)]
*  They say that they are searching for hostages. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=339.04s)]
*  I want to bring in Matthew Chance, who is across this story, following the developments [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=342.52000000000004s)]
*  reporting today from Tel Aviv. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  Matthew, what do we know? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=349.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, I mean, we're all bracing, of course, for the... [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=352.36s)]
*  I'm getting it coming back in my ear here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=356.68s)]
*  We're all bracing for the possibility of a large scale Israeli invasion by land into [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=364.76s)]
*  But of course, we have to remember that complicating that military operation is the fact [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=366.12s)]
*  that there are between 100 and 150 Israeli hostages that have been hidden by Hamas militants [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=372.28s)]
*  after they were seized in sites Israel all across that territory. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing now, according to the IDF, small limited incursions into [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=382.03999999999996s)]
*  the Gaza Strip with the express purpose of, you know, first of all, trying to neutralize [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  terrorist locations is the first thing they say, but also to try and locate the whereabouts [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=393.76s)]
*  of some of those hostages. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=399.2s)]
*  In fact, the newly appointed hostage affairs coordinator here in Israel gave me a statement [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=401.0s)]
*  earlier saying that they were doing everything they could on every level to try and search [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=407.47999999999996s)]
*  every area of ground to try and find where these people are, where the people are located. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=413.32s)]
*  And I think this is a part of it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=419.88s)]
*  But to be clear, it is not, we don't think, the beginning of the large scale land invasion [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=421.76s)]
*  that everybody's braced for. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=428.56s)]
*  But again, to reiterate, when that happens, the presence of those captives in the Gaza [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=430.24s)]
*  Strip is something that the military planners are going to have to take into account. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=436.56s)]
*  Already, Hamas militants say that as a result of the ferocious airstrikes that have been [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  pounding areas of the Gaza Strip for the past several days, at least 13 of the hostages [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=445.88s)]
*  they took have been killed. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=451.76s)]
*  That's not been corroborated by the Israelis or by the United States. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=453.47999999999996s)]
*  But it does underline what a precarious situation the military planners are and we all are [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=456.52s)]
*  currently involved in, Becky. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=463.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and diplomatic sources had told me earlier in the week and confirmed now by the Prime [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  Minister of Qatar speaking alongside the US Secretary of State today saying that there [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=471.44s)]
*  are efforts that they are mediating between Israel and Hamas to try and effort the release [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  of those hostages. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=483.56s)]
*  Earlier on in the week, we were told that the efforts are around an exchange of hostages, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=484.6s)]
*  women and children, Israeli women and children in Gaza for women and youth in prisons in [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=490.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=499.4s)]
*  So we know that that is ongoing. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=500.4s)]
*  We also know that the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, who's been in Jordan and is now in [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=502.08s)]
*  doing the rounds, trying to ensure that there is some sort of humanitarian corridor set up [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=509.84s)]
*  for and some sort of safe zones set up for these Gazans. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=516.92s)]
*  We just spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister who said that Gazans need to stay within the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=522.9599999999999s)]
*  country as far as Jordan is concerned, within the enclave as far as Jordan is concerned. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=528.88s)]
*  They don't want to see the spillage of Gazans outside of the enclave, but clearly, as they [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=534.16s)]
*  are told by the IDF to move from northern Gaza, one assumes because there is this imminent [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=540.64s)]
*  assault by ground and air forthcoming, the IDF trying to ensure that Gazans are evacuated [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=548.44s)]
*  out of the way. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=556.12s)]
*  Hamas, of course, telling Gazans to stay in place. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=557.12s)]
*  There is an awful lot going on. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=561.84s)]
*  The Secretary of State not only looking at the humanitarian corridors and the hostage [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=563.52s)]
*  issue, also speaking to the Israelis and the region about how to de-escalate what is going [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=567.96s)]
*  on both in the short term, in the hours to come, and trying to ensure that this conflict, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=575.0s)]
*  what is going on here now in Israel and in Gaza, does not spill outside of these borders. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PntaOSdyto&t=582.32s)]
