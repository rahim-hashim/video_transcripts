# Biden confirms 4-year-old Abigail Edan among hostages released
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k)
*  A little girl named Abigail, turned four years old, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=0.0s)]
*  she spent her birthday, that birthday, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=4.32s)]
*  at least 50 days before that, held hostage by Hamas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=7.0s)]
*  Today, she's free, and Jill and I, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=11.08s)]
*  together with so many Americans, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=14.36s)]
*  are praying for the fact that she is going to be all right. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=15.92s)]
*  You know, she's free and she's in Israel now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=20.92s)]
*  And so those who are now wrapping Abigail [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=24.04s)]
*  in love and care and the supportive services she needs, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=29.2s)]
*  she's been through a terrible trauma. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=33.08s)]
*  You know, her mom was killed in front of her [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=36.0s)]
*  when her kibbutz was attacked by Hamas terrorists [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=38.48s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=42.04s)]
*  Abigail ran to her dad then, who then was gunned down, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=43.76s)]
*  gunned down as well, while using his body [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=48.32s)]
*  to shield little Abigail. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=51.08s)]
*  She then ran to a neighbor for help, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  where they were all taken hostage, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  that entire house of neighbors were taken hostage by Hamas, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=57.36s)]
*  and held for 50 days. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=61.84s)]
*  What she endured is unthinkable. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=64.32s)]
*  Abigail was among 13 hostages released today from Gaza, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  under the brokered and sustained, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=70.92s)]
*  though intensive, U.S. diplomacy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=73.4s)]
*  She's now safely in Israel, and we continue to press [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=75.68s)]
*  and expect for additional Americans [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=79.08s)]
*  will be released as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=80.6s)]
*  And we will not stop working until every hostage [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=82.36s)]
*  is returned to their loved ones. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=84.92s)]
*  As I said when I spoke about this deal on Friday, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=87.48s)]
*  this has been the product of a lot of hard work [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=90.56s)]
*  and weeks of personal engagement for me and my team. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=92.8s)]
*  We have been in close contact with the leaders of Qatar, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=96.64s)]
*  Egypt, and Israel, speaking with each one of them [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  repeatedly over the past few weeks [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=102.0s)]
*  to help secure this deal. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=105.0s)]
*  We spoke again yesterday with the Emir of Qatar, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=106.4s)]
*  who I owe special thanks to, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=109.44s)]
*  in order to keep the hostages released on track [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=111.36s)]
*  and push for Abigail to be part of this release. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=114.0s)]
*  And I'll be speaking again shortly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=116.88s)]
*  with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  and we will continue to remain personally engaged, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=120.8s)]
*  personally engaged to see that this deal is fully implemented [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=123.88s)]
*  and work to extend the deal as well. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=127.24s)]
*  For weeks, I've been advocating to pause in the fighting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=130.12s)]
*  for two purposes, to increase the assistance [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=133.6s)]
*  getting into the Gaza civilians who need help [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=136.12s)]
*  and to facilitate release of hostages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  We know that innocent children in Gaza [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=142.2s)]
*  are suffering greatly as well because this war [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=144.32s)]
*  that Hamas has unleashed is so has such consequences. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=147.6s)]
*  Thousands have been killed, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=151.48s)]
*  and from the earliest days of this crisis, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=152.64s)]
*  I've worked closely with President Sisi of Egypt, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=155.32s)]
*  Israeli government, King Abdullah of Jordan, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  and leaders throughout the region [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=160.72s)]
*  to expand the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  to help innocent Palestinians in need [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  who are not part of Hamas. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  Under this deal, fighting in Gaza [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=169.72s)]
*  has now been paused for three days. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=172.16s)]
*  Over that time, 58 hostages have been released, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=174.68s)]
*  including the Thai, Filipino, and Russian nationals. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=178.32s)]
*  Dozens of families have been reunited, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=181.8s)]
*  and we worked urgently, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=184.44s)]
*  urgently to take advantage of the pause [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=185.8s)]
*  to surge aid into Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=188.52s)]
*  We've moved approximately 200 aid trucks into Gaza each day, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=191.4s)]
*  loaded with food, water, medicine, fuel, and cooking gas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=195.24s)]
*  More is needed, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=199.76s)]
*  but this deal is delivering lifesaving results. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=201.04s)]
*  Critically needed aid is going in, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  and hostages are coming out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=206.48s)]
*  And this deal is structured so that it can be extended [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  to keep building on these results. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  That's my goal, that's our goal, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=213.88s)]
*  to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=215.32s)]
*  so that we can continue to see more hostages come out [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  and surge more humanitarian relief [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=220.6s)]
*  into those in need in Gaza. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=223.04s)]
*  We've seen this is the day-by-day approach, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=225.88s)]
*  hour-by-hour process. Nothing is guaranteed, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=229.04s)]
*  and nothing is being taken for granted. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=231.95999999999998s)]
*  But the proof that this is working [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  and worth pursuing further is in every smile [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  and every grateful tear we see on the faces of those families [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  who are finally getting back together again. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=244.16s)]
*  The proof is little Abigail. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=247.12s)]
*  More than 20 other children, 18 years and younger, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  have been released. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=252.92s)]
*  They've been released through this deal as well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=254.2s)]
*  They've endured a terrible ordeal, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  and they can now begin a long journey toward healing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=259.04s)]
*  I'm going to continue working with the Emir of Qatar, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=262.2s)]
*  President Sisi of Egypt, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=265.2s)]
*  and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=266.52000000000004s)]
*  to do everything possible to see the hostages are freed, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  all the hostages. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=272.92s)]
*  I'm grateful for the personal partnership [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=274.44s)]
*  as we pursue this deal from each of those, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  when I just mentioned, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  and as we've worked together to see the â€” [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=280.64s)]
*  see all this implemented, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=283.16s)]
*  and now to try to extend it further, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=284.24s)]
*  I'll continue working with all our partners [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=287.12s)]
*  to take the hard but necessary steps [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=289.28s)]
*  to build an integrated and more prosperous [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=291.24s)]
*  and more peaceful future in the region. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  A two-state solution is the only way to guarantee [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=296.2s)]
*  a long-term security of both Israelis and Palestinian people, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  to make sure Israel and Palestinians alike [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=304.24s)]
*  live in equal measure of freedom and dignity. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=307.08s)]
*  We'll not give up on working toward that goal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  So, thank you very much. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=312.72s)]
*  But, thank God, she's home. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=314.2s)]
*  A little â€” I guess I can't imagine the enjoyment in the â€” [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=316.36s)]
*  I just â€” I wish I were there to hold her. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=321.6s)]
*  The Press. Mr. President, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=323.92s)]
*  do you have an update on the other Americans [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=325.12s)]
*  who are being held in any sense [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=326.88s)]
*  as to when they would be released? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=328.2s)]
*  The President. We are hopeful, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=331.16s)]
*  but I don't have anything firmly to tell you at this moment. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  The Press. Sir, do you expect that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=336.92s)]
*  if you are able to use this momentum [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=339.0s)]
*  to extend the pause, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=341.12s)]
*  have you extracted any guarantees about proof of life [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=342.68s)]
*  for other hostages, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=345.52000000000004s)]
*  or do you have an expectation of how much longer [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=347.0s)]
*  you could push this pause? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=349.82s)]
*  The President. Well, look, you know, the deal calls for every â€” [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  for every 10 hostages released to extend another day. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  So, I'm hopeful this is not the end that's going to continue. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=358.12s)]
*  But we don't know. And â€” but I get a sense that â€” [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  all the players in the region, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  even the neighbors who aren't â€” [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=370.84s)]
*  have been directly involved now, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  are looking for a way to end this [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=374.64s)]
*  so the hostages are all released and Hamas is completely â€” [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=376.52s)]
*  how can I say it? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=384.96s)]
*  No longer in control of any portion of Gaza. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=386.28s)]
*  The Press. Do they have control of all of the hostages, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=388.7s)]
*  or are there still other militant groups [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=390.88s)]
*  that you have to deal with? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=392.64s)]
*  The President. We think there are probably other militant groups, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=394.34s)]
*  but we're not certain. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=396.12s)]
*  The Press. Mr. President, how is Abigail doing? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=398.04s)]
*  What's her physical condition? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you have any information on â€” [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=402.68s)]
*  The President. Well, I haven't gotten that information. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=403.72s)]
*  I just wanted to let you know immediately. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=405.68s)]
*  They were going to cross into Egypt, as you recall. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=408.44s)]
*  That was the route. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=412.32000000000005s)]
*  But an older, non-American elderly woman is very sick [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=414.0s)]
*  and was in need of immediate medical help. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=420.72s)]
*  So, they arranged to cross directly into Israel [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=423.56s)]
*  to be able to take her to a hospital. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=426.12s)]
*  All I know is that she has been held. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I haven't seen a photograph. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  I've just been in communication with my team. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=433.32s)]
*  But she is safely ensconced in Israel. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=435.88s)]
*  But there's a lot more work to be done. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  The Press. How many days would you like to see the positive on board? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=441.04s)]
*  The President. I would like to see us move to a point [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  where we were able to â€” well, let me put it this way. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  I'd like to see the pause go on as long as prisoners kept coming out. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=455.32s)]
*  All right. Thank you all so very much. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=458.56s)]
*  I know â€” you know, we have to call you â€” [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=462.28s)]
*  I know you say, what's he calling me with only 10 minutes or so? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=465.52s)]
*  I noticed. I said, that's a notice I get. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=468.56s)]
*  Because we didn't know â€” [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=472.12s)]
*  I didn't want to be having this press conference [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=473.4s)]
*  if they weren't physically â€” [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=475.76s)]
*  even when they were in the Red Cross ambulance, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=477.4s)]
*  I didn't want to do it because they were not out. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=479.91999999999996s)]
*  They were still in Gaza. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=482.24s)]
*  So, I don't thank you enough, but thanks for your patience. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=484.16s)]
*  And I know if â€” [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=487.8s)]
*  The Press. We're here any time, sir. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=488.8s)]
*  The President. Any time. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=490.36s)]
*  The Press. All right. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=491.36s)]
*  Do you want to say a last time? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=492.56s)]
*  The Press. Happy holidays. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=493.8s)]
*  The President. Okay. Happy holidays to you guys. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=494.8s)]
*  The Press. Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBLvPKT3R6k&t=496.36s)]
