# Israel warns of possible ‘all-out war’ after Hezbollah publishes video of military, civilian sites
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE)
*  Fears of an expanding conflict in the Middle East after Israel's foreign minister warns Hezbollah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=0.0s)]
*  it would be destroyed if all out war breaks out. Israel cats his comments online follow Hezbollah's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  release of a purported nine-minute drone video that shows sensitive military locations and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  civilian areas in Haifa and other Israeli cities and while tensions percolate along the northern [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=20.56s)]
*  border with Lebanon there's a brewing diplomatic rift between the Netanyahu government and the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=27.28s)]
*  White House. We are connecting the dots on this for you with Ben Weidman back with us this hour [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=33.36s)]
*  from Beirut. Paula Hancox is in Jerusalem and Lauren Fox is in Washington on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=39.68s)]
*  Let me start with you Ben, just describe to us the importance of this purported video shot by [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=47.44s)]
*  drones Hezbollah says from Lebanon over Israeli cities including Haifa which of course serves as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=57.6s)]
*  a crucial gateway to the rest of the world and maybe more importantly for Israel. How does Hezbollah [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=67.04s)]
*  manage to fly a drone in such strategic locations and is this psychological warfare that we're looking at here? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=72.48s)]
*  Well Becky I think the Israelis are also trying to figure out how it is that Hezbollah was able [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=80.88s)]
*  to fly those drones over some very sensitive military positions, military industries, the port [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=88.32s)]
*  where we see huge oil storage of facilities they got it all. Now for one thing what we've been [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=96.56s)]
*  seeing from almost the the beginning of the back and forth skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israel [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  is that Hezbollah has been targeting Israeli surveillance and observation equipment all along [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=109.44s)]
*  the border. The Israelis in fact brought in cranes to replace the destroyed surveillance equipment [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=116.16s)]
*  and Hezbollah took those out as well so clearly there are holes in their ability to see what [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=123.52s)]
*  enters Israeli airspace but above and beyond that clearly Hezbollah has the technical capabilities [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=129.36s)]
*  to collect this sort of sensitive information well inside Israeli territory. It's about 30 kilometers [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=138.0s)]
*  from the nearest point on the Lebanese-Israeli border to Haifa. Was it a propaganda video? Well [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=147.52s)]
*  actually if you looked at the text in the video there wasn't anything about attacks it was just [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=156.08s)]
*  very sort of factual explaining what this location is, what it served, what you're seeing and it [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=161.44s)]
*  really is a message to the Israelis that you know don't don't mess with us. We not only have the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=168.48s)]
*  ability to collect intelligence inside your deep inside your territory on very sensitive sites but [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=175.44s)]
*  along with that probably comes other capabilities that we've seen slowly unveiled in the last [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  few weeks. For instance Hezbollah in the last few months has been able to fire shoot down three [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=192.4s)]
*  Hermes 900 Israeli drones very sophisticated drones that can fly as high as 30 000 feet. They [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=198.64s)]
*  took those out with anti-aircraft missiles. Two weeks ago they were able to strike according to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=205.92s)]
*  Hezbollah but the video would also seem to confirm that an Israeli iron dome battery, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=212.48s)]
*  the iron dome is really the backbone of Israel's missile defense system. So even though Israeli [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=217.67999999999998s)]
*  officials like the foreign minister are talking about destroying Hezbollah, Hezbollah is showing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=226.16s)]
*  that it's not a foe that should be underestimated in any sense of the word. Becky? Yeah this is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  not Hamas we are speaking about here. Paula let me bring you in here because as we discussed with [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=242.64s)]
*  Ben at what is going on on that northern front which is a you know a clear issue for the Israelis [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=247.67999999999998s)]
*  there is a serious rift beginning to open up now between Benjamin Netanyahu and the Biden administration. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=256.08s)]
*  So have you ever listened to what he had to say about Secretary of State Anthony Blinken yesterday? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=264.24s)]
*  It's inconceivable that in the past few months the administration has been withholding weapons and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=270.32s)]
*  ammunition to Israel. Israel, America's closest ally, fighting for its life, fighting against Iran [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=278.64s)]
*  and our other common enemies. Secretary Blinken assured me that the administration is working [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=284.24s)]
*  day and night to remove these bottlenecks. I certainly hope that's the case. It should be the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=289.84s)]
*  case. What's the perspective in Israel about why it is that Benjamin Netanyahu released that video [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=295.12s)]
*  yesterday very pointedly speaking there about a conversation with Anthony Blinken? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=306.16s)]
*  And speaking in English Becky so it's very clear that the audience is American, the audience is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=315.2s)]
*  international. This is not for domestic considerations. Now it's no secret that there [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=319.76s)]
*  are differences between the Israeli leader and the the US President Joe Biden. They've certainly [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  had their differences over recent months not least because the US has been pushing Israel to [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  be more careful in Gaza to push for this ceasefire something the Israeli Prime Minister has not openly [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  said that he will agree to this ceasefire hostage deal and also pushing for a Palestinian state [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=346.16s)]
*  something that the Israeli Prime Minister has said he does not support so the differences between [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  these two sides are very pronounced. It is surprising though that he would come out and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=356.8s)]
*  and do this so publicly washing dirty laundry in public if you like and it did have quite a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  surprised response from the Biden administration as well. Listen to this. We as you know [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=368.48s)]
*  are continuing to review one shipment that President Biden has talked about [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=375.76s)]
*  with regard to 2,000 pound bombs because of our concerns about their use in a densely populated [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=383.6s)]
*  area like Rafa that remains other under review but everything else is moving as it normally would [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=389.44s)]
*  move. We generally do not know what he's talking about we just don't. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=396.88s)]
*  And there's no Israeli official at this point that's going on the record to speak about this. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  No one appears to want to have their name next to this video Becky. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=405.28s)]
*  That's what I mean. Lauren let me bring you in at this point because all of this happening [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  just ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to Washington in July to address Congress. We have [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=417.36s)]
*  seen some pushback already with some lawmakers saying that they will boycott that. Have a listen [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=426.64s)]
*  to Senator Elizabeth Warren earlier. Do you plan to attend Prime Minister Netanyahu's address to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=431.36s)]
*  Congress? No look we need a ceasefire we need to get those hostages back we need humanitarian [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=438.56s)]
*  relief and we need to be giving both parties a big shove toward getting to the negotiations [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=446.0s)]
*  table and working out a peaceful solution. Should the president make clear that he should not [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=452.8s)]
*  address Congress Netanyahu? Look that's up to the president but I'm not going. Well Joe Biden facing [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  some quite serious backlash within his own party on this isn't it and he's really looking at a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  dilemma ahead of November's election. Explain if you will. Yeah I mean this is still a month away [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=475.28s)]
*  and I think it's clear that there are many progressive Democrats who plan to boycott [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=482.96s)]
*  Netanyahu's speech when he comes to address Congress in July but this is really coming from [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=488.23999999999995s)]
*  two different places. You know on the one hand there is just disagreement with Netanyahu's [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=494.64s)]
*  handling of this conflict in the Middle East. On the other there's also this feeling from some [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=500.96s)]
*  liberals that you are putting Joe Biden in this position where someone who has been critical of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=506.47999999999996s)]
*  the president is coming and addressing Congress just months before the November election. So it's [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=513.1999999999999s)]
*  really sort of the politics abroad and also the politics at home that they don't agree with. You [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=518.48s)]
*  have to keep in mind this is happening in the context in which the house speaker Mike Johnson [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=523.6s)]
*  has put a series of really tough votes on the floor that have fractured Democrats in some cases. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=528.32s)]
*  Now there's really typically just a small number of Democrats that vote with Republicans on some [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=534.88s)]
*  of those proposals but it has been one of the most difficult conflicts for the leader the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=539.7600000000001s)]
*  Democratic leader in the house Hakeem Jeffries to manage within his conference and so you know I [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  expect that there is going to be a large number of Democrats boycotting Netanyahu's address to [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  Congress. We should note that about a decade ago when he came to Capitol Hill there were also [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=556.48s)]
*  dozens of Democrats who boycotted the speech so that's not precisely new but I think the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  numbers might be larger. It's also possible that they have press conferences or some kind of other [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=566.4s)]
*  counter programming when he comes to speak so it would go beyond just not showing up for the [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=571.76s)]
*  speech it would be sort of more of a tacit opposition as well. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_LixBP0vXE&t=577.44s)]
