**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY)
*  and a warning for you now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=0.0s)]
*  Some disturbing video we're going to show you in the latest update of the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=6.08s)]
*  Israel Hamas war. These are some of the victims after a deadly 24 hours in [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=9.98s)]
*  central Gaza. The Hamas run health ministry says at least 250 people were [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=14.68s)]
*  killed from Israeli strikes. 70 of the victims were at the Al Maghazi refugee [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=19.18s)]
*  camp Sunday. Israel Defense Forces told CNN quote in response to Hamas is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=24.92s)]
*  barbaric attacks. The IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=29.68s)]
*  administrative capabilities. Also today, Israelis, Israel's prime minister [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=34.08s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu was in Gaza his second trip to the battlefield, vowing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=38.76s)]
*  to continue the quote long fight a day after promising to intensify the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=43.12s)]
*  campaign against Moss. The IDF says since Friday, at least 15 of its [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=48.06s)]
*  soldiers have been killed in Gaza. CNN senior international correspondent [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=52.92s)]
*  Will Ripley is in Tel Aviv. Will tell us more about what the prime minister [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=56.9s)]
*  said to troops today during that visit to Gaza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=61.26s)]
*  Well, he's certainly there to send them encouragement to say that their [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=65.18s)]
*  sacrifice. This was one of the deadliest weekends in this 80 day war [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=68.94s)]
*  for the Israeli military, just like it was one of the deadliest 24 hour [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=73.1s)]
*  periods in Gaza since this war began back on October 7th, 80 days and you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=77.3s)]
*  have more than 20,600 people who have been killed on the Palestinian side [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=82.86s)]
*  along with more than 53,000 injuries. And even though Israel's death toll is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=89.66s)]
*  is much lower, they do say that they are adhering Jessica to international [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=94.56s)]
*  law that they are not indiscriminately targeting civilians, but they're going [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=98.98s)]
*  after specific military targets based on intelligence. They say they're [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=102.86s)]
*  targeting changes as different intelligence comes in and they say the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=107.18s)]
*  fact that Hamas is choosing to position itself in areas densely packed with [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=111.34s)]
*  civilians who are sheltering civilians who are displaced that that makes Hamas [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=116.66s)]
*  just as culpable for this skyrocketing death toll. This is the Israeli argument [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=120.62s)]
*  as it does Israel itself. So despite that we had this U. N. Resolution last [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=124.72s)]
*  week that of course hat was quite watered down from the original draft [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=129.06s)]
*  that the United States vetoed and then there were several delays as they were [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=132.54s)]
*  rewriting it. Israel says they're not going to stop until they obtain their [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=135.74s)]
*  objective, which is to eliminate the leadership of Hamas and they have not [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=141.0s)]
*  been able to do that yet. Netanyahu in northern Gaza, where they have [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=144.72s)]
*  essentially obtained operational control meeting with the troops and [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=148.64s)]
*  saying that this war will continue President Biden in a phone call with the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=151.72s)]
*  prime minister of Israel, encouraging a more slower, more focused, streamlined [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=156.12s)]
*  technique, not such a such a large scale casualty type of situation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=161.84s)]
*  President Biden speaking with Democratic donors did on one instance use the word [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=166.8s)]
*  indiscriminate bombing, which would be a violation of international law. But then [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=171.4s)]
*  the Israelis really said that that one reference from the U. S. President is [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=175.26000000000002s)]
*  not reflective of their reality on the ground. And so the fighting absolutely [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  continues and you have a Christmas day where we have now just had some of the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=183.36s)]
*  deadliest incidents since this war began 80 days ago. And well, before we [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  let you go, the I. D. F. Has also revealed these new details about the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=192.64s)]
*  Hamas tunnel network that they've been trying to destroy and penetrate there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=196.04s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  So this is a network of tunnels underneath Gaza. Hamas has publicly [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=205.1s)]
*  stated in the past that they've built hundreds of miles of tunnels under Gaza, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=209.9s)]
*  although the exact number of the tunnels is unknown and impossible to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  independently verify. But what Israel says they discovered and uncovered is [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=218.04s)]
*  a very elaborate tunnel system, very high tech with capability to house [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=222.48s)]
*  weapons facilities, bunkers, command headquarters, even living quarters, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=227.4s)]
*  apartments for the Hamas senior leadership. And they also say that they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=233.44s)]
*  recovered the bodies of five Israeli hostages, three of them soldiers, two of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=236.72s)]
*  them civilians. And once those five bodies were recovered and repatriated [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=241.24s)]
*  back here to Israel, that underground tunnel complex that was housing the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=245.52s)]
*  Hamas leadership and a lot of the leadership operations was destroyed. Of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  course, the leadership has since moved on to another location. Jessica Israel [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=253.2s)]
*  trying to track them down. But this is a fight that experts say is likely to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=256.5s)]
*  continue for many, many months to come because Hamas is actually getting more [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=259.96s)]
*  resources funneled in from their supporters amongst whom they've [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  actually gained credibility since October 7th for keeping this fight going. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=266.91999999999996s)]
*  Uh, and so they're gonna get more money. They're gonna get more weapons. And [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=271.24s)]
*  Israel says they're going to have to keep fighting. Well, Ripley for us [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=273.96s)]
*  tonight in Tel Aviv. Thanks so much for that reporting. Well, we appreciate it [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  and joining us now to talk a little bit more about this is retired Army [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  Brigadier General Mark Kemet. Thanks so much for being here on this Christmas [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  Day. We really do appreciate it. I want to start first with with some of wills [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=288.08000000000004s)]
*  reporting there. We know that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  said that Israeli forces are intensifying. That's his word operations [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  inside the Gaza Strip. What do you think an intensification looks like at this [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=300.44s)]
*  point? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=305.48s)]
*  Well, I think it means probably putting more ground troops in to finish up the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=307.28s)]
*  fight inside of Gaza St. More ground troops to finish the fight on units. I [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=311.62s)]
*  think it also means that they may step up the amount of air attacks that are [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=316.76s)]
*  going into both of those cities. Uh, because I think that they recognize [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=320.28s)]
*  that international criticism cannot continue at this level. So the sooner [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=326.32s)]
*  they mop this up, sooner they clean this up the better. And candidly, that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=332.0s)]
*  saves lives by speeding it up simply because you won't be fighting as many [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=336.88s)]
*  days when you hear casually tolls of 250 plus. And his statement, Benjamin [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu statement is coming after the secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=347.68s)]
*  said last week that this conflict quote needs to move to a lower intensity [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=351.24s)]
*  phase. So obviously opposite there. You mentioned international support and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=355.74s)]
*  outside support for Israel. What do you anticipate the U. S. Support for [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=360.56s)]
*  Israel is going to look like as we continue moving forward? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=364.58s)]
*  Well, look, these types of operations consume a significant amount of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=369.04s)]
*  ammunition, significant amount of bombs, significant amount of artillery rounds. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=372.32s)]
*  I think we will continue to provide those assets, which, oh, by the way, we [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=377.4s)]
*  are also and need to continue to provide Ukraine. I certainly hope that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=381.96s)]
*  part of those ammunition packages include precision guided weapons so that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  the Israelis can be more precise in their attacks. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  And let's talk more about the tunnels that will also kind of walked us through [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=396.44s)]
*  there in his reporting before we came to you. There's the idea has this new [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=400.40000000000003s)]
*  disclosure about what the tunnel network looks like in Gaza, kind of where they [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=404.04s)]
*  have been able to go. And they also reported the bodies that they found of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=409.12s)]
*  the five Israeli hostages that had been recovered. What are you taking away [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=413.24s)]
*  from this information about these tunnels and what the I. D. F. Is finding [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  there? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=422.96s)]
*  Well, what it indicates to me is that for many, many years, money that has [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=424.94s)]
*  been provided by the United Nations has been siphoned off to buy the concrete, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=428.68s)]
*  to buy the sand, to buy the material that is necessary to build these 300 [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=433.36s)]
*  miles of tunnels that had no other purpose than to fight wars. So I think [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=439.04s)]
*  it's not only a criticism of the barbarity of Hamas, but it's an implicit [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=444.08s)]
*  criticism of the U. N. Accounting for the money that they've been providing [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=448.56s)]
*  over the years. Because you're saying that that has that's where some of it [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=451.8s)]
*  has gone. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=456.7s)]
*  I don't know how else these tunnels could have appeared without the funding [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=458.74s)]
*  necessary. And there's no other real source of funding inside of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=463.24s)]
*  Gaza, except the money provided by the U. N. And some money that's been [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=468.88s)]
*  provided by Qatar. And just quickly, lastly, before I let you go, you know, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  they talked about the five bodies of the hostages that were found there. We're [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=477.16s)]
*  now closing in on three months in this conflict. And there are still dozens, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=481.72s)]
*  over 100 hostages that remain in Gaza. Where do you see this going? Does [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=487.92s)]
*  that rely solely on a diplomatic solution? Or is there any sort of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=493.16s)]
*  military intervention that you see coming down the road at all? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  I would be very surprised if even the highest end military soldiers inside the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=501.76000000000005s)]
*  special operations community of Israel would be capable of bringing back even a [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=507.70000000000005s)]
*  percentage of the hostages. So it will depend on diplomacy. But nonetheless, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=513.2s)]
*  one of the messages that Prime Minister Netanyahu gave to his troops on the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=518.58s)]
*  ground is keep fighting. The soldiers need to focus on fighting because they [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=522.16s)]
*  can't depend on diplomacy to fix this. And so they're gonna keep fighting until [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=526.28s)]
*  this war is over. That seems to be certain. All right, Brigadier General [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=530.5s)]
*  Mark Kemet, thanks so much again. We appreciate it and Merry Christmas to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=534.28s)]
*  you [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=537.44s)]
*  and you as well. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC6mg0R5fSY&t=538.76s)]
