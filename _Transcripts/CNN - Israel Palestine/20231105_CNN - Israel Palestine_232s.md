# Hear what Queen Rania of Jordan said about Hamas and the 'root cause' of the conflict
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE)
*  Despite increasing calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, Israel remains defiant against those calls until Hamas releases all hostages. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the rejection, saying it would only give Hamas more time to regroup and attack Israel again. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=9.0s)]
*  But he did reiterate today on a surprise visit in Baghdad that he is still pursuing a humanitarian pause. Blinken, that is. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=18.0s)]
*  The Queen of Jordan says a stance against a ceasefire is ill-advised and will not bring peace to the region. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=26.0s)]
*  CNN's Becky Anderson is in Doha, Qatar, and spoke with Queen Rania earlier today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=33.0s)]
*  Fred, we've seen consistent and united calls for a ceasefire across this region, including from Jordan's Queen Rania. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=41.0s)]
*  Israel has flatly rejected those calls. And when Arab leaders met with Antony Blinken in Amman on Saturday, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=49.0s)]
*  the U.S. Secretary of State reaffirmed the U.S. position that a ceasefire will only enable Hamas to commit more attacks like the one on October 7. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=57.0s)]
*  Well, Queen Rania said that position was short-sighted. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=68.0s)]
*  If you manage to eliminate all of Hamas, what next? The root cause of this conflict is an illegal occupation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=73.0s)]
*  It is routine human rights abuses, illegal settlements, disregard to U.N. resolutions and international law. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=82.0s)]
*  If we do not address these root causes, then you can kill the combatant, but you cannot kill the cause. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=91.0s)]
*  She went on to say that the death of civilians will only further the cause of Hamas and not bring peace to Israel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=99.0s)]
*  But Israel has insisted that it is doing its best to protect civilians and blames Hamas for using them as human shields. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=108.0s)]
*  Queen Rania cited how Israel has used its evacuation orders on why she doesn't think that those claims stand up. Have a listen. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=116.0s)]
*  Never mind that the evacuation orders are sent online or on television, knowing that there is no electricity in Gaza since the beginning of this war. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=125.0s)]
*  These evacuation orders, I do not believe, are for the benefit of the Gaza civilians. They are not the target audience. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=136.0s)]
*  The rest of the world is. It is Israel's attempt to try to legitimize their actions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=143.0s)]
*  When it comes to human shields, I think we need to defer to international law. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=149.0s)]
*  Of course, the use of human shields is criminal, but even if one side puts a civilian in harm's way, that civilian is still entitled to full protection under international humanitarian law. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=153.0s)]
*  That is the global standard, and no nation is exempt. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=166.0s)]
*  In a place like Jabalia, which is one of the most crowded corners of Gaza, Gaza being one of the most densely populated spots on Earth, civilian death is not incidental. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=170.0s)]
*  It is not accidental. It is a foregone conclusion, and that makes it a war crime. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=182.0s)]
*  Jabalia is the refugee camp in Gaza where civilians have been sheltering in UN schools. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=188.0s)]
*  It's been hit on multiple occasions, including this weekend. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=195.0s)]
*  And at the end of the conversation, Queen Rania had a really poignant message for those standing behind Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=200.0s)]
*  She said that if you are an ally to Israel, you need to give them the uncomfortable truth that they have crossed the line. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=207.0s)]
*  That is Queen Rania's position, and it really speaks to the frustrations that you hear across this part of the world, the Arab world, that we have been reporting on now for weeks. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=215.0s)]
*  Fred? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=227.0s)]
*  Becky Anderson, thank you so much. And Doha. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctAqSH8rOWE&t=228.0s)]
