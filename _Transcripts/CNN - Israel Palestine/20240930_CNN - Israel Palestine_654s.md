# Ground operation in Lebanon not a 'solution to the problem', former Israeli prime minister says
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20)
*  We're at the site of an Israeli airstrike that took place at 1 a.m. on Monday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=0.0s)]
*  This apartment on the fifth floor was hit. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=6.88s)]
*  According to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, three of their members were [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=10.72s)]
*  killed in that strike, in addition to one other person, as reported by the Ministry [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=16.12s)]
*  of Health. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=21.36s)]
*  Now, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is a Palestinian faction that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=22.36s)]
*  has a presence here in Lebanon but has not been active for several years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=27.26s)]
*  It's not clear if Israel is now taking the opportunity to target not just Hezbollah and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=32.300000000000004s)]
*  others who've been firing into Israel, but all of the factions that are opposed to Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=37.54s)]
*  Now, many of the people who left the southern suburbs moved to areas like this because they [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=43.66s)]
*  thought it might be safer. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=49.1s)]
*  Clearly, that's not the case. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=51.22s)]
*  Well, if Israel does send ground troops into Lebanon, it wouldn't be the first time. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=54.3s)]
*  In 2006, Israel invaded Lebanon hoping it could suppress attacks by Hezbollah in a way [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=59.81999999999999s)]
*  that it found impossible using air power alone. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  An eerily similar situation to today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=70.42s)]
*  In the brutal course of a 34-day war, more than 1,000 Lebanese were killed in 2006. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=73.66s)]
*  Well, Ehud Olmert was Israel's prime minister at the time of the 2006 invasion, and he joins [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=81.26s)]
*  us now. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=88.7s)]
*  And I do want to spend a bit of time with you reflecting on what happened back in 2006 [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=89.7s)]
*  and the lessons learned. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=94.06s)]
*  But Israel today has set returning the residents of the north back to their homes as a goal [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  of this war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=101.58000000000001s)]
*  Do you believe that the action today, the assassination of the Hezbollah chief and many [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=102.98s)]
*  of his commanders and the potential for a full on war on Hezbollah using ground troops, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=109.1s)]
*  if that is the decision, is the right move to restore security, sir? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  They started the war on the 8th of October without any provocation. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  They made it clear from the outset that they have nothing against us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=126.25999999999999s)]
*  They just want to help the Hamas. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=129.18s)]
*  And they were shooting rockets, maybe sometimes 300 a day, for a long time, and they forced [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=132.22s)]
*  out more than 80,000 of Israeli residents in the north away from their homes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=138.58s)]
*  So it was inevitable. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=143.58s)]
*  We had to respond. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=144.94000000000003s)]
*  We have to reach out. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=146.06s)]
*  We have to try and change the balance. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=147.3s)]
*  But if you ask me whether this is a game changer in the sense that it can resolve comprehensively [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=149.62s)]
*  all the problems and create an entirely new situation in Lebanon, I don't think so. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=156.38000000000002s)]
*  I wish, by the way, perhaps against your judgment before, that the outcome of this war will [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=162.74s)]
*  be similar to the one that was in 2006. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=169.66s)]
*  We had for 17 years, there was not one bullet shot from across the border from Lebanon to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=178.82s)]
*  What a great outcome it may have been if we had a similar situation right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=179.82s)]
*  I quite frankly don't think that the ground is a solution to the problem. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=185.18s)]
*  I think that... [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=190.54s)]
*  ...make use of the weakening of Hezbollah now and the certain disarray which took place [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=193.9s)]
*  as a result of the targeting of Nasrallah and the others. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=201.06s)]
*  And perhaps this is the time where a concerted effort by the Lebanese government, by the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=205.58s)]
*  state of Israel, by America and by France to build up the military power of the Lebanese [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=211.46s)]
*  army, to squeeze inside Lebanon the Hezbollah and to drive them of their positions and military [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=219.38s)]
*  capacities within Lebanon is what we should do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=229.34s)]
*  With respect, you know how weakened that Lebanese army is. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=233.78s)]
*  So long term that might be an option. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=239.9s)]
*  That isn't an option. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=242.98s)]
*  There is no way that that Lebanese army can be bolstered with sufficient capability anytime [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=244.5s)]
*  soon. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=251.62s)]
*  Netanyahu's critics both here and abroad say that this is him trying to prolong a forever [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=252.62s)]
*  war and I know that you've been an arch critic to keep his far-right coalition on board but [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=258.06s)]
*  many others are supporting his decision to go after Hassan Nasrallah and his commanders [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=263.7s)]
*  and to keep up that momentum. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=270.5s)]
*  You don't agree that that is where he should go from here on in. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=274.82s)]
*  What's the alternative at this point? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=280.14s)]
*  I mean a ceasefire proposal tabled by the US and France has gone nowhere at this point. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=282.18s)]
*  A diplomatic solution doesn't seem to be in the toolbox for the Israeli Prime Minister [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=289.34s)]
*  at this point. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=295.14s)]
*  What do you think of the war in the north or in the south which will be acceptable to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=300.26s)]
*  the Prime Minister of Israel? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=304.38s)]
*  So I've been in a very comfortable position that you ask me what do you think of the Prime [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=306.34s)]
*  Minister of Israel? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=311.78s)]
*  But I don't want to spell it out now because this is not what I want to say. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=312.78s)]
*  What I want to say is that we have to stop the war in the south and I think we have reached [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  the objective that we set out that we could achieve in the south and there is nothing [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  more that is worth the cost of fighting in the south but particularly the danger to the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=330.3s)]
*  lives of the hostages which are still alive and which we may have brought them back in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=337.3s)]
*  part of an agreement to ceasefire in the south and pull out. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=343.18s)]
*  What we need to do in the north, we need to create a certain platform together with France [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=348.82000000000005s)]
*  and with the United States and the United Nations and an international force, a robust [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=359.38000000000005s)]
*  international force different from the one that we're seeing now in the south of Lebanon [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=366.58000000000004s)]
*  and in coordination with the Lebanese government that will end to resolve all the outstanding [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=374.34s)]
*  issues between us and the Lebanese about the borderline and the Shiba Farms which are minor [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=381.38s)]
*  issues that can be resolved I think and to establish a certain process that will allow [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=385.94s)]
*  the Hezbollah to move, the weakened Hezbollah in order to move them out away across from [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=393.3s)]
*  the Litani River in the north. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=400.09999999999997s)]
*  This will not resolve all the issues but it will open up for an opportunity to build [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=402.42s)]
*  up the necessary political powers and the military powers within Lebanon which may [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=407.3s)]
*  change the balance but in the meantime it will allow bring back the citizens of the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=413.7s)]
*  north into where they live. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=420.1s)]
*  This is something we can do. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=422.26s)]
*  You asked whether Netanyahu agrees to it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=425.22s)]
*  Do you think that or do you wonder whether Netanyahu will be ready to conclude the military [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=428.34s)]
*  operations in the south and the military operations in the north and sit down and start to think [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=436.5s)]
*  that he's, I think, beyond him. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=443.06s)]
*  I don't think he wants it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=445.7s)]
*  I don't think he's capable of it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=447.05999999999995s)]
*  I don't think that he is ready yet to face all the other challenges which awaits him. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=449.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, nearly a year on from October the 7th, Benjamin Netanyahu has staged a remarkable [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=457.7s)]
*  turnaround though Likud, his party, would still struggle to form an election or a government [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=464.34s)]
*  where elections are held today. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=470.98s)]
*  This campaign in recent weeks has buoyed the Prime Minister to heights pretty unimaginable [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=473.14s)]
*  in the aftermath of the Hamas attack and in what is perceived as a largely political move, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=480.58s)]
*  Netanyahu brought in a former rival, Gideon Zah into his government as a minister without [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=486.98s)]
*  portfolio. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=493.54s)]
*  Just have a listen to what he said, sir. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=494.34s)]
*  Now it's no secret that there were differences between us in the past but since October 7 we [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=499.38s)]
*  both put behind us all that has happened. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=504.5s)]
*  That's what happened when Gideon Zah joined the government in October and that's how it [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=506.98s)]
*  is going to be when Gideon is returning to the government and the security cabinet today. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=511.3s)]
*  We will work together shoulder to shoulder and I intend to use his help in the forums [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=516.5s)]
*  that influence the conduct of the war. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=521.62s)]
*  What do you make of that decision? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=526.66s)]
*  You want to ask me what do I think about it? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=529.38s)]
*  It sounds really good. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=531.38s)]
*  By the way, I suggest that you not be carried away with what appears to be two weeks of [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=532.8199999999999s)]
*  success that would have changed entirely the political balance in Israel. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  The polls which were taken yesterday after the operation in the weekend, after the speech [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=544.9799999999999s)]
*  of Netanyahu in the United Nations showed the same balance between the two blocs. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=551.4599999999999s)]
*  72 members of the Knesset, which is a huge majority, are against the government and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=556.26s)]
*  against Netanyahu. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=563.62s)]
*  So I think that for the time being, Netanyahu holds on to the coalition, he will have a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=565.3s)]
*  most stable coalition for the time being in terms of numbers in the Knesset, not in terms [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=575.9399999999999s)]
*  of the attitude of the Israeli public opinion, not in terms of the attitude of the political [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=581.86s)]
*  different factions. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=590.42s)]
*  They don't trust him, they don't believe in him, they don't think that he is focused on [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=592.9s)]
*  what is important for the state of Israel. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=598.5s)]
*  We are in the middle of a big crisis, a crisis where Israel is on the one hand in a war which [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=601.22s)]
*  we completely, all of us, support the basic objectives of from the beginning, considering [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=608.98s)]
*  how it started and what happened to us and how the brutal Hamas murders, butchered and killed [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=618.1s)]
*  and raped and beheaded Israelis, something which is unforgivable and unforgettable, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  and it necessitated the Israeli reaction. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=632.26s)]
*  On the other hand, we have a government which we don't trust, a government which we don't [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=637.9399999999999s)]
*  believe in, and a prime minister which is in the middle of a war in the state of Israel, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=642.5s)]
*  doesn't have the support of the majority of the people. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLoWgcdND20&t=650.5799999999999s)]
