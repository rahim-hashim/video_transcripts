# This Israeli battalion has a history of abuse. CNN uncovers how their commanders are now operating
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg)
*  This is the Netzer Yehuda battalion, an Israeli army unit showcasing their military might [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=0.0s)]
*  in a promotional training video. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=9.44s)]
*  But the unit has a decades-long history of abusing Palestinians in the West Bank, and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=11.84s)]
*  the Americans know it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=18.56s)]
*  A State Department investigation found they had committed gross human rights violations. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=20.56s)]
*  But this finding never led to U.S. sanctions. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=26.48s)]
*  Even media reports of possible sanctions outraged Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=29.44s)]
*  So, despite their track record, the Netzer Yehuda battalion is still receiving American [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  arms and is now operating in Gaza. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=46.24s)]
*  We tracked down one former soldier from the unit. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=49.64s)]
*  In a rare interview, he remembers fellow soldiers bragging about their excessive violence towards [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=52.58s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=57.62s)]
*  We've hidden his identity and voice as he fears reprisal. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=58.62s)]
*  There were some kids throwing rocks in a small village. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  That normally isn't a big deal, but the company commander decided, let's throw them a party. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=65.02s)]
*  So they took the emergency response team and 20 soldiers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=70.66s)]
*  They walked door to door, throwing flashbangs and gas grenades into people's homes as a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=74.02s)]
*  punishment for the kids throwing rocks. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=78.58s)]
*  Collective punishment? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=81.18s)]
*  Yes, collective punishment. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=82.18s)]
*  The commander said it was fantastic to see the look on their faces. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=83.58000000000001s)]
*  When we look at those abuses that have happened in Netzer Yehuda over the years, there's [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=86.94000000000001s)]
*  a chain of command here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=92.22000000000001s)]
*  What responsibility does the battalion commander, the person at the very top, what responsibility [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=95.28s)]
*  does that commander have for what happened? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=100.7s)]
*  I think he has all the responsibility. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=103.58000000000001s)]
*  If these commanders don't put their foot down and punish them for their behaviour, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=106.30000000000001s)]
*  then they are in fact condoning their behaviour. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=110.26s)]
*  He told us his years in the battalion changed his outlook completely. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=112.7s)]
*  He now feels compelled to speak out about the battalion's mistreatment of Palestinians. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  The officers he's talking about follow a chain of command. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  What happens under their watch is their responsibility. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=125.62s)]
*  But despite this, we found some of these same commanders who were in charge when allegations [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=129.14000000000001s)]
*  of human rights abuses emerged have been promoted again and again into senior roles [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=134.66s)]
*  in the IDF. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=140.74s)]
*  Using facial recognition technology, CNN found this commander, Lieutenant Colonel Nitai Okashi, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=142.56s)]
*  now in Gaza in a senior role running ground operations. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=148.9s)]
*  Back in 2019, he ran the Netzer Yehuda battalion and was in charge when these soldiers, seen [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=154.7s)]
*  him laughing as they beat and humiliate a Palestinian man and his son. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=162.62s)]
*  Both arrested for assisting the killer of two fellow Netzer Yehuda soldiers, their journey [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=167.5s)]
*  to the police station left the father with three broken ribs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=172.46s)]
*  Five were later jailed for their actions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=176.82s)]
*  Yet their commander, Okashi, told investigators while he condemned the violence he said deploying [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=180.02s)]
*  the soldiers was necessary to make the killer pay and to create a sense of success among [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=185.42000000000002s)]
*  the fighters. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=190.88s)]
*  He remained as commander and has been promoted since. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=192.06s)]
*  But Okashi is not the only Netzer Yehuda commander with a dark past. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=196.5s)]
*  This is Lieutenant Colonel Mati Shevach rousing troops before a deployment. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=207.9s)]
*  But just over a year later, soldiers under his command left for dead this elderly Palestinian [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=212.86s)]
*  Omar Assad here lying on the ground, bound and blindfolded as a soldier watches on. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=219.4s)]
*  His death, the IDF admitted, a moral failure. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=226.32s)]
*  But no soldier faced charges for his death and their commander faced only a reprimand, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=229.68s)]
*  yet still he was later promoted. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=234.52s)]
*  Now training Israeli ground troops preparing to enter Gaza, even featuring in high-profile [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=237.36s)]
*  interviews with American media, boasting of his soldiers' enthusiasm for war. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=242.36s)]
*  The major concern for most of the soldiers is that we're going to have to stop. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=247.2s)]
*  We asked the man previously in charge of investigating the Netzer Yehuda's abuses for the US government [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  what he made of these promotions. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=257.96s)]
*  That is very bad news. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=260.08s)]
*  That shows, first of all, that Israel, that the government of Israel has no intention [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=262.52s)]
*  of holding the Netzer Yehuda battalion accountable. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=267.88s)]
*  He says the US is not following their own laws by sending them weapons. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  Of course we treat Israel differently. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=275.64s)]
*  And that really undermines our human rights advocacy in the rest of the world. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=277.96s)]
*  The law that Congress passed and our taxpayer funded assistance is going to Israeli units [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=282.84s)]
*  that have committed gross violations of human rights. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=292.5s)]
*  This assistance, despite the growing evidence of abuse, CNN exclusively obtained the names [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=297.24s)]
*  of three more Israeli units found by US officials to have committed gross human rights violations [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=302.88s)]
*  prior to October 7th. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=309.36s)]
*  All are still operating, including the Yemam seen here in Gaza in an operation that rescued [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=312.56s)]
*  four Israeli hostages but left nearly 300 Palestinians dead, according to local health [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=317.82s)]
*  authorities. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=323.4s)]
*  The Israeli military dispute that the toll was so high. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=324.4s)]
*  As the death and destruction mounts, it is US weaponry supporting these units, begging [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=330.32s)]
*  the question for how much longer will Israel's greatest ally choose to turn a blind eye? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=336.24s)]
*  Katie Poglaze, CNN, London. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXLANlZX4tg&t=342.6s)]
