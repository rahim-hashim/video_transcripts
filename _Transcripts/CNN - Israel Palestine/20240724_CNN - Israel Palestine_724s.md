# ‘Iran’s useful idiots’: Netanyahu calls out protesters during speech to Congress
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo)
*  We recently learned from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence that Iran is funding [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=0.0s)]
*  and promoting anti-Israel protests in America. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=8.6s)]
*  They want to disrupt America. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=11.56s)]
*  So these protesters burn American flags even on the 4th of July. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  And I wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina who protected [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=19.8s)]
*  the American flag, protected the American flag against these anti-Israel protesters. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=25.08s)]
*  For all we know, Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests that are going on right now outside [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=55.08s)]
*  this building. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=64.12s)]
*  Not that many, but they're there and throughout the city. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=65.34s)]
*  Well, I have a message for these protesters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=68.36s)]
*  When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=72.36s)]
*  their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=78.2s)]
*  idiots. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=84.28s)]
*  Some of these protesters, and it's amazing, absolutely amazing, some of these protesters [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=110.08s)]
*  hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=116.4s)]
*  They might as well hold up signs saying chickens for KFC. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=120.32s)]
*  These protesters chant from the river to the sea, but many don't have a clue what river [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=130.32s)]
*  and what sea they're talking about. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=136.6s)]
*  They not only get an F in geography, they get an F in history. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=141.2s)]
*  They call Israel, they call Israel a colonialist state. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=146.79999999999998s)]
*  Don't they know that the land of Israel is where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob prayed, where [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=151.88s)]
*  Jeremiah preached and where David and Solomon ruled? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=157.96s)]
*  For nearly 4,000 years, the land of Israel has been the homeland of the Jewish people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=175.6s)]
*  It's always been our home. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  It will always be our home. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  It's not only the campus protesters who get it wrong. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=206.28s)]
*  It's also the people who run those campuses. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=209.5s)]
*  80 years after the Holocaust, 80 years after the Holocaust, the presidents of Harvard, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=212.22s)]
*  Penn and I'm ashamed to say my alma mater, MIT, couldn't bring themselves to condemn [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=220.54s)]
*  the cause for the genocide of Jews. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=228.26s)]
*  You remember what they said? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=230.9s)]
*  They said, it depends on the context. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=234.14s)]
*  Well let me give these befuddled academics a little context. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=239.57999999999998s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is the world's oldest hatred. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=249.77999999999997s)]
*  For centuries, the massacre of Jews was always preceded by wild accusations. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=252.94s)]
*  We were accused of everything from poisoning wells, to spreading plagues, to using the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=258.82s)]
*  blood of slaughtered children to bake Passover matzahs. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=264.46000000000004s)]
*  These preposterous anti-Semitic lies led to persecution, mass murder and ultimately to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=270.02s)]
*  history's worst genocide, the Holocaust. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=276.3s)]
*  Now just as malicious lies were leveled for centuries at the Jewish people, malicious [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=279.86s)]
*  lies are now being leveled at the Jewish state. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=285.5s)]
*  No, no, don't applaud. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=288.5s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=292.7s)]
*  The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimize [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  Israel to demonize the Jewish state and to demonize Jews everywhere. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=300.74s)]
*  And no wonder, no wonder we've witnessed an appalling rise of anti-Semitism in America [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=306.5s)]
*  and around the world. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=311.70000000000005s)]
*  My friends, whenever and wherever we see the scourge of anti-Semitism, we must unequivocally [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=313.62s)]
*  condemn it and resolutely fight it, without exception. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=321.98s)]
*  And don't be fooled when the blood libel's against the Jewish state come from people [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=343.62s)]
*  who wear fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones about law and justice. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=357.74s)]
*  Here's a case in point. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=363.54s)]
*  The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has shamefully accused Israel of- [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=366.9s)]
*  He continued to bring it back to Iran, the country that is by all accounts funding and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=371.86s)]
*  supporting not just Hamas in Gaza, but Hezbollah in the north, in Lebanon and the Houthis. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=378.74s)]
*  So this was another really important overarching theme that Netanyahu understandably has been [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  obsessed with, the growth and the strength and the determination of Iran to eradicate [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=394.14s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=399.98s)]
*  And what he did here was to continue to connect for an American audience and an Israeli audience, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=401.1s)]
*  but Israel doesn't need to be educated on this, but more for an American audience, that [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=406.14000000000004s)]
*  Iran isn't just out for Israel. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=411.06s)]
*  Iran is out for American, to topple American democracy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=413.62s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=416.26s)]
*  And he called the protesters Iran's useful idiots. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=417.26s)]
*  He relished going after the protesters saying that they didn't realize, didn't know the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=421.34000000000003s)]
*  history, know the context, know how oppressive the Iranian regime is. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=428.3s)]
*  And he relished it. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=433.74s)]
*  I mean, this was, he was going after these protesters, going after the leaders of some [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=434.74s)]
*  of these schools. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=440.02s)]
*  He called them befuddled academics. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=441.02s)]
*  We're 10 months into this conflict. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=443.26s)]
*  We're a hundred days out from a presidential election. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=444.78s)]
*  In some ways, the conflict has fallen off the radar of many Americans. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=447.78s)]
*  It's going to start back up, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=451.8s)]
*  If you think about what's happening in the context of some of these campus protesters, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=453.08s)]
*  they're going to go back to school. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=457.38s)]
*  There's going to be a DNC convention in Chicago, expected to be a lot of protesters there. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=459.41999999999996s)]
*  So this is very much going to be top of mind heading into this election. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=464.61999999999995s)]
*  And we don't quite know, we don't have an idea yet of what Trump would really do in [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=469.02s)]
*  office. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=473.21999999999997s)]
*  It's something he hasn't really detailed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=474.21999999999997s)]
*  And we also don't know what a Kamala Harris administration would do and how that would [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=475.82s)]
*  be different from a Biden administration. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=480.7s)]
*  What did you think of that reception he received in the Congress? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=481.7s)]
*  That was powerful. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=485.05999999999995s)]
*  It was powerful. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=486.05999999999995s)]
*  And these are Republicans, mostly a lot of Democrats didn't come, although some Democrats [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=487.26s)]
*  were there and they were standing up and cheering. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=491.1s)]
*  And listen, there is a sense that Americans do need to be more educated on what's going [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=493.66s)]
*  on there, on the history of anti-Semitism, on the ways in which anti-Semitic tropes led [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=498.86s)]
*  to the Holocaust. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=504.44s)]
*  And so there was teachable moments, right, when he was trying to educate people in terms [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=505.44s)]
*  of the history. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=509.82s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond is in Israel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=510.94s)]
*  And Jeremy, I wanted to ask you about the hostages. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=512.8199999999999s)]
*  And I talked to right before this speech to the parents of one of the Israeli and American [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=517.66s)]
*  hostages, Edan Alexander. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=524.58s)]
*  And the parents were there, other family members of hostages were there. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=528.38s)]
*  We did see the prime minister call out some of them, acknowledge some of them. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=534.22s)]
*  And then when it comes to the big question that they all have, when are my family members [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=540.14s)]
*  going to come home? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=544.54s)]
*  He did promise that. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=545.54s)]
*  But just like David and Barack were saying, not a lot knew that we heard from him about [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=547.46s)]
*  getting to that point with a deal with Hamas, with the help of Qatar and America. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=553.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Dan. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=562.98s)]
*  I think the Israeli prime minister paid a lot of lip service to the issue of the hostages. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=563.98s)]
*  He talked about it during a section of his speech. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=568.02s)]
*  But if you look at the overall context of the speech, the overall content of what the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=570.54s)]
*  Israeli prime minister said, he talked far, far more about achieving victory in this war [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=574.62s)]
*  against Hamas, about destroying Hamas's military capabilities and vowing we will fight until [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=580.34s)]
*  we achieve victory. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=587.7s)]
*  He said some phrase like that a few different times throughout the speech. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=588.94s)]
*  He talked about that far more than he did this ceasefire agreement, which US officials [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=594.9s)]
*  as well as Israeli officials have indicated to me in recent days is very much within reach. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=599.66s)]
*  One official actually told me that it's now up to Israel, that it's now up to the Israeli [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=605.86s)]
*  prime minister effectively to decide whether or not he actually wants a deal. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=609.78s)]
*  And as Barack was saying there, the Israeli prime minister has told his delegation to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=614.18s)]
*  hold off on traveling to meet with the mediators and share Israel's latest response until after [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=618.18s)]
*  he meets with President Biden tomorrow, effectively pushing off that trip by the delegation, most [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=625.18s)]
*  likely until after Shabbat. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=631.3399999999999s)]
*  So that would probably be on Sunday. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=632.78s)]
*  But I think beyond that, Dan, I think what we also need to do here is fact check a few [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=634.98s)]
*  key things that the Israeli prime minister said, because he made several claims here [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=638.98s)]
*  that attempted to not only defend the Israeli military's conduct in Gaza, but that also [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=642.9399999999999s)]
*  flew in the face of many of the facts on the ground when he was talking about the ICC's [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=647.3399999999999s)]
*  claim that Israel is starving people of Gaza. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=652.34s)]
*  You know, he talked about big numbers of aid getting in, but there is just very, very clear [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=654.7s)]
*  evidence. You talk to any humanitarian organization that actually works on the ground in Gaza, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=659.58s)]
*  the United Nations. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=664.7800000000001s)]
*  And even when you look at Israel in the way that they have turned on and back off the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=666.02s)]
*  faucet of aid to Gaza, there is clear evidence that Israel has not always allowed enough [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=670.82s)]
*  aid in, that they have not done enough to de-conflict militarily to provide safe routes [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=675.7800000000001s)]
*  for that aid to get in. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=680.9399999999999s)]
*  And you also have to remember that ministers, members of Netanyahu's own government, called [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=682.62s)]

*  militaries and warfare, including how the United States has carried out its campaigns, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=711.34s)]
*  and they will all say that Israel has not taken nearly as many precautions as most modern [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUUqUNYFcmo&t=715.42s)]
