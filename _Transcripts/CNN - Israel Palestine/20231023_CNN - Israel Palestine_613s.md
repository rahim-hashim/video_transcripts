# See the new weapon Israel is using to fight Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0)
*  We are just getting some news in when we talk about the 320 airstrike Israel launched overnight [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=0.0s)]
*  in Gaza about exactly how they are dealing with precision targeting. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=4.72s)]
*  News that there is a new weapon that Israel is actually using in this fight that they [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=8.72s)]
*  have first deployed during this now 17-day war and deploying it nearly a dozen times, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=12.1s)]
*  their Magellan Commando Unit, in charge of using this certain type of mortar or bomb. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=17.76s)]
*  I want to get to Nick Robertson, Starode Israel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=23.36s)]
*  Nick, this is new information into CNN about what exactly Israel is doing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=25.76s)]
*  What have you learned about this weapon and this unit that we understand is called the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=29.96s)]
*  Magellan Commando Unit? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=34.08s)]
*  Yes, specialist unit using a new weapon, a specialist new weapon, steel sling, steel [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=37.04s)]
*  sting. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=45.28s)]
*  This is a weapon that really advances technologically the old-fashioned mortar. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=46.36s)]
*  The old-fashioned mortar is sort of a close infantry tool. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  You can use it close to the front line or a little further back. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=55.82s)]
*  It fires really high in the air, goes right up and comes right down. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=59.36s)]
*  Now typically in the past if you're using the old-fashioned version, you need a forward [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  spotter who can see where it's hitting and it takes maybe three rounds for a good mortar [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=66.64s)]
*  team to put around precisely on a target. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=70.92s)]
*  This new system apparently does away with that entirely. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=74.08s)]
*  It is computer controlled. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=77.66s)]
*  You dial in the designated location of the target and this mortar fires and hits that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=79.24s)]
*  target with pinpoint accuracy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=84.96s)]
*  That's what the IDF is saying. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=87.44s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  It means when they see a small Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad unit out in the field with an [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  anti-tank weapon, the sort of thing that was used yesterday to kill an IDF soldier, they [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=97.08s)]
*  can pinpoint them precisely and hit them quickly and readily. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Now we weren't aware of this being operational in the region and we've become used to hear [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=105.92s)]
*  the explosions, the detonations, missiles and artillery, but this had a whole new sound [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  and when we first heard this weapon firing off, we ducked for cover because it literally [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=116.6s)]
*  made this huge whoosh and went right over us and we didn't know what it was. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=121.24s)]
*  We did hear it impact, see it impact. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=125.28s)]
*  So this is something the IDF really hopes can help it target precisely small groups. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=128.32s)]
*  And Nick, it's interesting that you're saying you can actually by audio hear that it's very [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=136.64s)]
*  different, that your actual physical reaction, your adrenaline reaction would be different. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  It's really very significant because you've been standing there the whole time and of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  course in Ukraine you hear artillery or used to all of these sounds. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=147.08s)]
*  Just some context here though, Phil, 320 strikes overnight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=151.0s)]
*  They said 205 I think the day before yesterday. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=154.24s)]
*  So I'm just putting it out here to make a point. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=157.16s)]
*  That's more than 500 strikes in any given 48 period and they've been running around [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  that rate, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=162.28s)]
*  Even the Palestinian Health Authority is not saying that there's anywhere near that many [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=163.74s)]
*  number of deaths a day. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  So it just, I'm making this point to make a use of the word precision. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=168.52s)]
*  They are incredibly precise and in fact it seems like in some cases they're actually [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=174.4s)]
*  targeted at operation command centers, not necessarily at individual Hamas operatives, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=177.48s)]
*  right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=182.68s)]
*  But at structural or infrastructural points, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=183.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=187.68s)]
*  Thank you, Erin. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=188.68s)]
*  We'll get back to you very, very soon. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=189.68s)]
*  And with us now editor and foreign affairs columnist at Bloomberg, Bobby Ghosh, and former [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  foreign policy advisor to the Bush administration, Mitt Romney, and the co-author of a new book [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=196.16s)]
*  coming up, The Genius of Israel, Dan Cieno with us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=200.68s)]
*  Thank you, both, for being here very much. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=203.76000000000002s)]
*  I actually want to begin with what we heard from the King of Jordan, Dan, over the weekend. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=205.96s)]
*  This is a U.S. ally, but he was emphatic, obviously choosing his words carefully and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=212.16s)]
*  sending a message. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=218.02s)]
*  Here he was. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=219.02s)]
*  The relentless bombing campaign underway in Rezegh, as we speak, is cruel and unconscionable [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=221.76s)]
*  on every level. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=229.08s)]
*  It is collective punishment of a besieged and helpless people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=231.36s)]
*  It is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=236.92s)]
*  It is a war crime. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=241.2s)]
*  To hear that, coupled with our reporting that the U.S. is urging Israel to pause, to wait, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=243.4s)]
*  to try to allow more time to get hostages out. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=249.38s)]
*  What, and the IDF says there is no ceasefire, there is no pause. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=252.16s)]
*  What does he read? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=257.0s)]
*  I think there are two things going on. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=258.0s)]
*  When you hear leaders in the region making those statements, I think they're very concerned [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=259.44s)]
*  about the Arab street getting hot, particularly the King of Jordan, who's worried about real [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=263.24s)]
*  volatility in his own population in Jordan, and whether or not the tensions between Israel [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=267.8s)]
*  and Gaza, Israel and Hamas, could have cascading effects for his own security, of his own power. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=273.0s)]
*  But leaders, most of the leaders in the Arab world, are quietly saying, I hope Israel wipes [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=279.08s)]
*  out Hamas once and for all. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=284.24s)]
*  What they're saying publicly and what they're saying privately are two different things, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=285.68s)]
*  particularly when you look into the Persian Gulf, the Sunni Gulf, they're hoping that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=288.12s)]
*  Hamas is wiped out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=290.96s)]
*  The question is the cost, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=292.56s)]
*  We heard Queen Rania, his wife, who's Palestinian, really concerned as well about the treatment [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=294.76s)]
*  of the Palestinian people in all of this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=299.92s)]
*  Look, I think there are legitimate concerns about the Palestinian civilians. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=302.08s)]
*  The question is who's responsible for that? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=305.4s)]
*  Who can ultimately control their fate? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=307.08s)]
*  Is it Israel or is it Hamas? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=308.74s)]
*  The U.S. administration's agenda is different. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=311.0s)]
*  I believe the Biden administration has minor, mild hope that they're going to get out some [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=313.32s)]
*  of the hostages, particularly the hostages with American passports. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  We saw two released last week. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=321.84s)]
*  I think Hamas is playing a very clever game where they're starting to dribble out hostages. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  I think you'll see more of that over the next few days. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=327.28s)]
*  And so the Biden administration is saying, wait, if we're going to start getting out [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=329.91999999999996s)]
*  a couple of hostages here and there, every couple of days, there's a family I'm meeting [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=332.34s)]
*  with today. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=336.08s)]
*  Hirsch Goldberg-Polin is a hostage who's here. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=337.08s)]
*  I think he's been on CNN. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=338.84s)]
*  His parents are here today meeting at the U.N. Security Council. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=341.04s)]
*  So a lot of these parents are organized as well they should be. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=343.92s)]
*  And the Biden administration is saying, give it time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=346.8s)]
*  This puts Israel in a real conundrum because they can wait and they can wait and they can [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=349.92s)]
*  wait. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=353.88s)]
*  At some point is the concern that will undermine their own future operation. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=354.88s)]
*  And if all that's released at the end of it are hostages, except for those that are just [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=358.24s)]
*  Israeli passports. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=362.92s)]
*  Bobby, Dan gets at the complexity here, which as I've spent a lot of time trying to get [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  my head around it, and while I'm certainly not a foreign affairs expert or foreign policy [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=370.24s)]
*  expert, I've covered a lot of this stuff for long enough to know that this is very different [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=373.92s)]
*  given how many cross-cutting variables they seem to be. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=376.88s)]
*  You talk about the leaders in the region who might be saying something publicly for effect, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=379.24s)]
*  saying something differently. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=382.92s)]
*  So the U.S. wants hostages out but is also moving in significant force posture increases [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=383.92s)]
*  for deterrence purposes, also potentially getting drawn into something bigger, while [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=391.44s)]
*  also trying to hug Israel and its leaders who they know are eventually going to launch [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  a ground incursion. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  How does this all move forward in the weeks ahead, given what Dan is talking about, the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=401.52s)]
*  hostages, where the Israelis are, a ground incursion, all these elements? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=404.56s)]
*  It moves forward very, very, very slowly until the ground offensive takes place and then [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=408.24s)]
*  it moves very quickly. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=412.84s)]
*  So that's the nature of these things. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=413.96s)]
*  Things happen slowly until they suddenly happen very, very quickly. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=417.32s)]
*  The triggering event now will be the ground invasion. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  Until then there will be all this diplomacy going around it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=424.56s)]
*  There will be more, depending on how long this continues, depending on how much time [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=428.56s)]
*  Israel takes to launch the ground offensive. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  I imagine there will be more gatherings of regional leaders. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=436.6s)]
*  Secretary Blinken will be on the road virtually all the time trying to herd all these cats together. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=439.6s)]
*  There will be a lot of negotiations behind the scenes involving the Qataris for those [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=446.48s)]
*  hostages and there will be lots of conversations between the White House and the Netanyahu Office. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=451.32s)]
*  When you say triggering, what is triggering me? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  What does it trigger? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=459.08s)]
*  And that's obviously the big concern when you talk to US officials. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=460.4s)]
*  Well, the calculation as to when the ground offensive begins will be made by the Israelis [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  and they will consider all kinds of factors, including the pressure from the United States. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=468.12s)]
*  But as Dan pointed out, they need to move in before too long. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=473.2s)]
*  There's a time limit on how much they can wait. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  There is a momentum. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=483.28s)]
*  We keep thinking of the pressure that's being put on Netanyahu from the outside. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=485.2s)]
*  We're not paying enough attention to the pressure from within, from Israelis. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=490.03999999999996s)]
*  And your correspondents on the ground will know this better than Aaron will know and Nick, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=494.32s)]
*  that Israelis want to see something done. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=499.4s)]
*  We're now two weeks away from the horrific events that began this chain of occurrences. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  And those events are still fresh in the minds of Israelis. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  They still want a reckoning for what happened on the 7th of October. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=511.52s)]
*  They still want to make sure that that never happens again. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=516.36s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to follow through on his promises, to go in and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=520.04s)]
*  finish Hamas once and for all. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  We can discuss around this table whether that's even possible. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=527.16s)]
*  But we must not discount the strength of feeling in Israel and the impact that feeling has [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=530.76s)]
*  on Netanyahu's, on his disposition towards Gaza. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=537.56s)]
*  And to the point earlier about what leaders say in public and what they say behind closed [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  doors, I think it's really interesting that CNN's reporting is now the Biden administration [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=547.76s)]
*  has pressed Israel to delay that ground invasion to try to get more hostages out. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=551.92s)]
*  But it's not something we've heard publicly from the president, except for what his team [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=556.4s)]
*  says was a misunderstanding of him saying yes to a question over the weekend. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you think there comes a point when that is something that the president says out loud? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=565.48s)]
*  No. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=569.8000000000001s)]
*  I think the president's approach so far has been to give the Israeli government and the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  Israeli people a big bear hug in public. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=575.36s)]
*  Say, I have your back. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=577.36s)]
*  I think what he did as we talked about last week was very dramatic by showing up in Israel [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  meeting with the war cabinet. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=582.6s)]
*  So a very forward leaning and sort of attach at the hip message publicly and privately [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=583.6s)]
*  comparing, conveying these messages. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  I do not believe he will stop. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=591.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't know about ever. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=593.36s)]
*  I can't say ever. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=594.4s)]
*  But in the near term, I don't think he's going to pressure Israel because the deterrent [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=595.4s)]
*  effect that that would wipe out if the U.S. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=598.92s)]
*  government is publicly in the president's voice pressuring Israel, the message that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  would send to Hezbollah, the message it would send to Iran would be disastrous. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=604.72s)]
*  Bobby, Dan, thanks, guys. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=610.72s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1EYsf7b9_0&t=612.04s)]
