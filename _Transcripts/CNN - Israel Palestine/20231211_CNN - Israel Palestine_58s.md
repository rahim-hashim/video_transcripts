# Israel dropped leaflets into Gaza with cryptic verse from Quran
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw)
*  What Israel is saying is they essentially are absolving themselves of that responsibility [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=0.0s)]
*  if civilians are killed once they tell people to move out of those areas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=4.16s)]
*  But Eleni, the way that they're doing it doesn't necessarily mean that the message is getting [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=7.76s)]
*  across. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=11.68s)]
*  They're posting it on social media. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=12.68s)]
*  They're dropping leaflets with QR codes that then take you to a website with a very complicated [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=13.68s)]
*  map. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=18.12s)]
*  And as we've reported extensively throughout this conflict, there has been there have been [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=19.12s)]
*  repeated blackouts, whether localized or all across Gaza, where people haven't been able [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=21.88s)]
*  to get online. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=26.72s)]
*  They can't use their phones to get onto the Internet. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=27.72s)]
*  And then even if they were able to, they'd see this incredibly complicated map. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=29.28s)]
*  The other day, Israel dropped a leaflet in southern Gaza around Hanunis that had a surah, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=33.12s)]
*  a verse from the Koran that referred to Noah's warning about a flood coming. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=39.8s)]
*  And it was it was rather cryptic. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=45.32s)]
*  But it appeared to be sort of a rather ominous warning telling the people in Hanunis to get [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=47.72s)]
*  out because the fighting is about to intensify. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=53.32s)]
*  And that's exactly what we've seen, Eleni. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cmdkyta7Iw&t=56.04s)]
