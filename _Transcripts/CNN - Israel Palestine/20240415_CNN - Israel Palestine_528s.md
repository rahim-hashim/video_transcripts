# 'It's a very big deal': Petraeus on the significance of Iran's attack
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4)
*  former CIA Director and retired four-star General David [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=0.0s)]
*  Petraeus. He also served as Commander of US Central [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Command which includes part of the Middle East. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=5.0s)]
*  Director Petraeus, thanks for joining us. What is your [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=7.24s)]
*  assessment of the attack by Iran? Was this a genuine [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=10.14s)]
*  attempt to retaliate, to overwhelm Israel's defenses, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=13.58s)]
*  to cause mass damage? Or was this a show of force for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=16.78s)]
*  Iran but indicating that they don't want actually to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=19.88s)]
*  escalate further? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=23.42s)]
*  I think it was probably a bit more of the latter than [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=26.16s)]
*  the former. Clearly it was unprecedented. There never [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  has been an attack that came from Iranian soil. And [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=32.66s)]
*  of course these attacks also included some of the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=35.56s)]
*  proxies in Iraq and Syria and southern Lebanon. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=37.76s)]
*  There's never been something like this in the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  past. But it seemed a little bit less than what they [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=43.900000000000006s)]
*  might have thrown if they were really serious. In [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=48.18s)]
*  fact it was probably a good bit less than if they [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=50.58s)]
*  really wanted to cause massive damage. It struck me [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=53.32s)]
*  as a little bit like that attack the Iranians did [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=56.300000000000004s)]
*  after the US killed Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad that [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  time. They telegraphed it well in advance. Again, no [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=62.34s)]
*  casualties out of that one. And in this case at most [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=66.58s)]
*  it appears that there was one Arab Israeli girl who [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=69.78s)]
*  was seriously injured and may have died. So there's a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=74.58s)]
*  tiny bit of this Goldilocks aspect to this I think, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=77.46000000000001s)]
*  although again a very significant attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  Iran and Israel have been fighting this shadow war in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=83.77999999999999s)]
*  the Middle East for decades now. This is the first [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=86.02s)]
*  time that Iran has directly attacked Israel from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=88.52s)]
*  inside Iranian territory not using proxies like [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=92.36s)]
*  Hamas or Hezbollah or the Houthis. Just how [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=95.5s)]
*  significant a moment is this for the Middle East? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  Well it is significant. It's a very big deal. And I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=103.44s)]
*  think Israel will have to take some action in [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=106.6s)]
*  response. I think it's very clear that the US would [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=108.83999999999999s)]
*  not be able to do that, be as limited as possible. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=112.42s)]
*  Keep in mind that the real issue here in addition to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=114.86s)]
*  Israel's security of course, which is first and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=118.0s)]
*  foremost, but it's also about freedom of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=120.44s)]
*  navigation from the Gulf or the oil and gas that come [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=122.64s)]
*  from the Gulf and fuel much of the global economy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=125.54s)]
*  That's the biggest issue here. And Iran I don't [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=128.18s)]
*  think wants to have that disrupted either because [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=131.24s)]
*  they export about 1.6 or 1.7 million barrels a day [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=133.78s)]
*  themselves. So keep your eye on that. Brent crude is [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=136.88s)]
*  going to be able to sell about $90 a barrel and it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=140.44000000000003s)]
*  would really spike if there was something that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=143.34s)]
*  interfered with freedom of navigation. In fact we [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=145.58s)]
*  need to figure out what's going on. Iran did take a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=147.72000000000003s)]
*  ship the other day that they claimed was in some way [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  dealing with Israel. But this is another step up the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=154.02s)]
*  rung of escalation. I think it's in the interest of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=159.66000000000003s)]
*  everyone to stop the increasing escalation. But [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=163.26000000000002s)]
*  we'll have to see what Israel decides to do in this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=167.4s)]
*  country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=169.84s)]
*  I think it's important to note, Mr. President, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=170.9s)]
*  that the United States will not participate in any [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=173.38000000000002s)]
*  offensive strikes by Israel against Iran. How [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=176.38000000000002s)]
*  would you advise Israel to respond to this? How [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=179.28s)]
*  worried are you that any response will only throw [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=182.08s)]
*  fuel on the fire? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=184.72s)]
*  Well, that has to be a concern and I'm sure [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  they're conscious of that, Jake. There's a whole [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=188.86s)]
*  menu of actions that they can take, not all of which [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=191.36s)]
*  are necessarily overt. They can pursue covert, they [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=194.56s)]
*  can attack cyber spaces and so forth. And keep in [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=197.82s)]
*  mind that of course Washington is meeting with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=200.72s)]
*  the other G7 countries to determine what kind of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  diplomatic and economic responses should follow in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=205.76s)]
*  a coordinated effort as well. Can't really take your [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=209.04s)]
*  eye off Gaza though. At the end of the day, got to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=213.38s)]
*  get those hostages back and I believe still do need [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=215.68s)]
*  to destroy Hamas. You don't send the fire [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=219.04s)]
*  department to extinguish 80 percent of the fire. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=222.22s)]
*  They still have work to do there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=225.38s)]
*  Thank you, General Petraeus. Always good to see you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=227.12s)]
*  Thank you so much for your insights. Joining us now [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=228.96s)]
*  the former Director of National Intelligence under [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=230.96s)]
*  President Obama, retired General James Clapper. So [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=233.6s)]
*  first of all just the size and scope of this. We've [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=238.66s)]
*  never seen anything quite like this in terms of Iran [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=242.0s)]
*  directly launching attack on Israel. So it does seem [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=245.2s)]
*  to mark a change, an inflection point of some [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=249.28s)]
*  sort, yes? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=252.08s)]
*  I think it's a good question, Jake, that a rublin [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=253.2s)]
*  con has been crossed here with Iran directly [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  attacking from Iran proper to Israel proper. That [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  said though, the size of the attack I think was very [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=266.94s)]
*  measured. I think the Iranians had to know that it [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=270.28s)]
*  would not overwhelm the coalition air defense [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=275.68s)]
*  and then at the end of it they declared it was done [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=279.18s)]
*  without having accomplished much in the way of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=284.82000000000005s)]
*  damage. So I think there was a messaging here but I [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=288.12s)]
*  still believe despite this very profound event that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=292.22s)]
*  the Iranians don't want a wider war as strange as [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=297.24s)]
*  that may seem. Well so explain to people at home [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  who think, they're saying General Clapper, how can [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=304.54s)]
*  you say they don't want a wider war? They just fired [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  300 attack drones and missiles at Israel. You [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=311.59999999999997s)]
*  think that the way they did it is significant? Well I [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  do because first they telegraphed it, they sent [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=318.8s)]
*  slow moving drones out first which you had hours to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=322.02s)]
*  prepare for and the Iranians have a lot of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=325.58s)]
*  missiles, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. So [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=330.21999999999997s)]
*  if they had wanted to I believe they could have [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=333.62s)]
*  overwhelmed the Israeli air defense system and that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=336.28s)]
*  of the coalition which was very important. I guess 20 [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=339.64s)]
*  percent or so of the projectiles were neutralized [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=343.82s)]
*  by U.S. or other coalition elements. So the whole way [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=348.38s)]
*  they went about this I think was very deliberate, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=352.96s)]
*  very measured. I don't think they want a wider war. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=356.12s)]
*  Of course now it's all up to the Israelis. So the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=360.36s)]
*  United States does not have an embassy in Iran. Iran [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  doesn't have an embassy in the United States. You [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=366.46000000000004s)]
*  think that this information about a week ago maybe or [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=369.74s)]
*  maybe a little bit less, the Biden administration [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=373.48s)]
*  started announcing or leaking to newspapers there's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=376.42s)]
*  intelligence that Iran is going to attack Israel. You [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=380.48s)]
*  think it's possible that Iran leaked that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=385.18s)]
*  intentionally? I think it's quite possible. They may [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=387.62s)]
*  have conveyed it to us. I think they probably weren't [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=391.86s)]
*  all that careful about masking their preparation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=395.56s)]
*  The fact that President Biden came back from [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  Delaware early, convened the national security team, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=402.44s)]
*  all these things tell me that we had good insight into [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=406.54s)]
*  what the Iranians were going to do. So why do it? So [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=411.34s)]
*  why would they do it? I think the Israelis have, the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=415.58s)]
*  Iranians have their own domestic political [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=419.64s)]
*  pressures. They have some very hard liners now [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=422.44s)]
*  surrounding the supreme leader. So I think they had [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=429.62s)]
*  that constituency to placate. And the fact that [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=433.8s)]
*  they showed the parade, if you will, celebratory [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=437.52s)]
*  parade in Tehran of the joyful Iranians so happy [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=443.9s)]
*  about the attack. And I think that's what was [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=449.29999999999995s)]
*  important to the Iranians. And I still believe they [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQMmtiCuG4&t=451.64s)]
