# One day, Israeli strikes will go 'too far,' expert tells Amanpour
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU)
*  Here to discuss is Sanam Vakil. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=0.0s)]
*  She's director of the Middle East program [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=1.84s)]
*  at London's Chatham House think tank. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=3.68s)]
*  Welcome to the program. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=6.32s)]
*  So do you feel, like apparently the secretary of state does, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=8.32s)]
*  that things are really teetering on the edge right now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=11.68s)]
*  in terms of the war expanding from Gaza [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  and across Israel's northern border into Lebanon? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=16.96s)]
*  There is a deep concern. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=19.92s)]
*  What has become almost normalized, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=21.64s)]
*  simmering tensions could really boil over. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=24.16s)]
*  And that's really where we are. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=26.64s)]
*  We've had attacks coming from the Houthis in Yemen [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=28.08s)]
*  that have attacked maritime shipping. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=31.84s)]
*  We have seen back and forth between Hezbollah and Israel [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=35.36s)]
*  at a dangerous level, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=39.08s)]
*  despite the regular messaging from Hassan Nasrallah [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=40.68s)]
*  that there is no intention of regionalizing this war. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=44.44s)]
*  There have been attacks in Syria, attacks in Iraq, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=48.28s)]
*  and this could very well lead to a miscalculation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=51.64s)]
*  Can I just point out and just emphasize [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=54.92s)]
*  what you just said about Nasrallah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=56.96s)]
*  Kim Gattas, as you know, Beirut-based journalist has tweeted, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=58.6s)]
*  Hezbollah and Iran have signaled clearly repeatedly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=62.44s)]
*  they want to avoid a wider war. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=65.68s)]
*  Israel keeps testing that position. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=67.36s)]
*  At some point it will miscalculate. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=69.44s)]
*  This was after these assassinations [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=71.4s)]
*  that we've just been talking about. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=74.16s)]
*  You know the region. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=76.12s)]
*  Everybody thinks they have a playing, a very clever game, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  targeted just so, calibrated just so. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=85.64s)]
*  But is miscalculation something that could happen? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=88.6s)]
*  I mean the Israelis and the Lebanese have already seen [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  what happened across their border in 2006, most notably. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=94.6s)]
*  Yes, I mean this is the clear risk, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=98.32s)]
*  and this was part of Anthony Blinken's primary objective [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=100.24s)]
*  for this trip to message that escalation [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=104.96s)]
*  is not in anybody's interest. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  The problem is that there are two different [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  strategies and timelines underway in the region. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  No country, no state or non-state actor in the region [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=116.68s)]
*  is really pushing for escalation, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=120.16s)]
*  whereas the Israeli government is trying to reset [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=122.16s)]
*  its deterrence levels since October 7th, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=127.44s)]
*  and that requires them not only to try and decapitate [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=129.96s)]
*  Hamas leadership, which we know 94 days on from October 7th [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=134.56s)]
*  they haven't been able to do, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=139.16s)]
*  but also to try to push back Hezbollah [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=140.44s)]
*  and make clear that their borders are safe, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=142.84s)]
*  and that's what's ongoing right now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=145.72s)]
*  Whereas the rest of the region, be it Iran, be it Hezbollah, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=148.44s)]
*  be it the wider Arab partners of the United States [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=151.8s)]
*  have no interest in seeing this explode [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=156.04s)]
*  because this could really take things into a new orbit. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=158.24s)]
*  And just remind everybody, I mean I covered the 2006 war, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=161.28s)]
*  it wasn't a victory by Israel or by Hezbollah, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=164.68s)]
*  it at best was determined to have been fought to a draw. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=167.84s)]
*  Then there was a UN resolution, I think it's 1701, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  that required them to move back from demarcated lands. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=174.48000000000002s)]
*  Apparently neither of them kept to that commitment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  So is there a political solution that actually can reinforce [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=183.56s)]
*  and deescalate the Lebanon or the Hezbollah-Israel [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=189.28s)]
*  tension right now? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=193.72000000000003s)]
*  Well, Amos Hoxhaen, another US official was just in Lebanon, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=195.0s)]
*  I think for this very issue, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=199.44s)]
*  trying to find a face-saving solution to push Hezbollah back [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=201.92s)]
*  according to UN resolution 1701, past the Litani River, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=205.76s)]
*  and also find a face-saving way for Hezbollah to do that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=211.04s)]
*  There have been suggestions that Hezbollah is pulling back, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=215.08s)]
*  but at the same time, you see the Israelis keep pressing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=218.28s)]
*  and keep striking at commanders in Lebanon, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  and this might be low-level escalation, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=226.11999999999998s)]
*  but there will be one day where this goes too far, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=228.76s)]
*  and this could be a very different war than 2006. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=232.55999999999997s)]
*  I spoke just when all this sort of flared up [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  to the Lebanese foreign minister, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=239.16s)]
*  who at the time was in Washington, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=241.32s)]
*  was about to visit the White House [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=243.04s)]
*  to talk about these tensions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=244.32s)]
*  This is what he said to me, partly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=245.72s)]
*  We don't want any escalation in the war. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=248.48s)]
*  We don't want what's happening in the South [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=251.32s)]
*  to be spread over Lebanon. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=253.84s)]
*  We don't like a regional war [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=255.83999999999997s)]
*  because it's dangerous to everybody, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=257.76s)]
*  dangerous to Lebanon, dangerous to Israel, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=259.96s)]
*  and to the countries surrounding Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, he's pretty much laid it out, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=266.88s)]
*  but it's very important for the prime minister of that country, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=268.4s)]
*  an ally of the United States, to be saying that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  How does Israel, if it does broaden into a big war, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=274.8s)]
*  how do you separate a war against Hezbollah [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=280.48s)]
*  from a war against Lebanon itself [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=282.72s)]
*  and the Western-backed Lebanese armed forces, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=284.68s)]
*  which have also been targeted? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=287.2s)]
*  I don't think you can, really, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  and I think this is, again, why... [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  Because the Israelis say we're not striking [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=292.32s)]
*  the Lebanese state. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=294.52s)]
*  This will be seen as a broader war, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=295.76s)]
*  and it's a war that won't just be about Hezbollah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=298.32s)]
*  This will involve the whole system. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=303.24s)]
*  Hezbollah itself is embedded into that system, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=305.76s)]
*  and it is part of the governance system, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=309.52s)]
*  whether the international community [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=312.52s)]
*  or the Lebanese like it or not, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=314.12s)]
*  and that in itself is the problem. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=315.52s)]
*  I want to ask you a couple of questions. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=317.92s)]
*  In the Times of London this Sunday, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=320.0s)]
*  the Sunday Times, you might have read it, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=322.12s)]
*  there was a front-page article [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=323.84s)]
*  by an Israeli journalist, Anshel Pfeffer, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=325.08s)]
*  who talked about the stash of papers and documents [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=327.36s)]
*  and maybe hard drives that some of the Israeli forces [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  had found apparently in Yahya Sinwar's office. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=334.32s)]
*  It talked about... [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  It was from a couple of years ago, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  but talked about trying to disrupt any kind of normalization, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  whether it was at the time between Turkey and Israel, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=347.16s)]
*  and it talked about their sort of strategy in the region. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=350.92s)]
*  Then before, there was also, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=355.92s)]
*  I think Chatham House even put this out, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=359.0s)]
*  Bronwen Maddox, who used to be a journalist, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=360.56s)]
*  had interviewed years ago Ahuri, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=362.8s)]
*  the Hamas leader who was assassinated, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=365.6s)]
*  and he had said to her that our aim is to radicalize, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=368.0s)]
*  in her words, the Palestinian population [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=373.56s)]
*  so that they do not go towards peace. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=375.4s)]
*  And Hamas wants to delegitimize the Palestinian authority [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=378.76s)]
*  and sort of disable any sentiment towards peace. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=384.04s)]
*  Do you think that's still what they think, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=387.88s)]
*  and in which case, how does one get over this? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=390.32s)]
*  How does one get to a day after? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=394.28s)]
*  Well, certainly there are elements [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=396.56s)]
*  of Palestinian leadership, Hamas leadership, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=399.4s)]
*  that have more radical sentiments. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=403.08s)]
*  I think where we are today is normalization has slowed, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=405.2s)]
*  if not stopped completely, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  and will be very far and hard to achieve [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=412.28s)]
*  without a ceasefire and without attending [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=415.6s)]
*  to the humanitarian issues on the table, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=417.8s)]
*  as well as without a plan that addresses [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=420.0s)]
*  the issue of Palestinian statehood [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=424.44s)]
*  that has been completely abandoned. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  So that's, I think, primary task here. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  But beyond that, what is urgently needed is a pathway [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=431.0s)]
*  that creates a process where Palestinian leaders [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=435.6s)]
*  can work together for reform, accountability, governance, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=440.44s)]
*  with elections at the end of this process. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=444.88s)]
*  And an opportunity for Palestinians themselves [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=447.2s)]
*  to elect their future leaders should certainly be [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=450.88s)]
*  an opportunity given to Palestinians, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=454.88s)]
*  not one that they've had for well over two decades now. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=457.88s)]
*  Yeah, they haven't gone to elections. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=461.2s)]
*  Last question, you are an expert and a student [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  of the Iran piece of this whole picture. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=466.64s)]
*  It also seems to be trying to staying out [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=470.52s)]
*  of a direct confrontation. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=472.72s)]
*  How long can that last, and what really does Iran [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=475.12s)]
*  want out of all of this? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=477.36s)]
*  Well, Iran's motivations are multiple. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=479.36s)]
*  Ultimately, the Islamic Republic has always been driven [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=482.48s)]
*  by its own sense of survival above all, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=485.72s)]
*  and its security and stability has always been paramount. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=488.28000000000003s)]
*  It has relied on the axis of resistance, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=491.32000000000005s)]
*  this network that it has cultivated and created [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=493.72s)]
*  over a number of decades, as its primary tool of deterrence [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=496.6s)]
*  against Israel and the United States, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=501.48s)]
*  two countries that it has defined as its threats [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=503.8s)]
*  in the region. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=506.76s)]
*  And so it will continue to support the axis of resistance, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=507.88s)]
*  but at the same time, Iran does see the US [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=511.16s)]
*  as a declining influence in the region, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  destabilizing regional influence above all. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=517.08s)]
*  And Iran has, over the past few years, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=520.4s)]
*  restored ties with the Gulf Arab countries. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  It is looking to forge stronger economic linkages [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=526.88s)]
*  and be part of an integrated Middle East as well. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=529.88s)]
*  And that, of course, is hard to achieve [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=533.88s)]
*  with its oppositional stance with the United States, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=536.0400000000001s)]
*  its accelerating nuclear program, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  and of course, this underlying tension with Israel [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=540.32s)]
*  that is, I think, Tehran is calculating, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=544.36s)]
*  will increase over this year in particular. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=546.84s)]
*  And just very briefly, before I let you go, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=550.08s)]
*  do you think there's a way to pull things back? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=552.12s)]
*  The Israeli foreign minister told the US foreign minister today [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=554.84s)]
*  that they're looking for some kind of diplomatic solution. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=557.64s)]
*  Yes, I think there is. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=561.0s)]
*  And it begins with a ceasefire. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=562.16s)]
*  That ceasefire can set the pathway forward [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=564.28s)]
*  to release hostages that have been completely neglected [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=567.32s)]
*  as Gideon Levy brought up in your previous interview. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  Beyond that, of course, the Arab states, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=573.96s)]
*  partners of the United States, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=577.2s)]
*  are gonna need to play a really important integral role [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  in guaranteeing Palestinian security, Israeli security, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=581.96s)]
*  providing a bridge to Iran, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=585.92s)]
*  making sure they're not a spoiler in what comes next. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=588.1999999999999s)]
*  This is gonna be a long process. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=590.8399999999999s)]
*  Waiting for the day after to begin that process [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=593.0s)]
*  is a bit too late. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=595.68s)]
*  Salam Vakif, Chatham House, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=597.5999999999999s)]
*  thank you so much indeed for joining us. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=driPTM5SqUU&t=598.88s)]
