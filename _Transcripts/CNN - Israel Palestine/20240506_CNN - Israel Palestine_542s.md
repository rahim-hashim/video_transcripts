# Israel’s military tells 100,000 residents in eastern Rafah to ‘evacuate immediately’
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng)
*  It appears that Israel is setting the stage for a long-feared ground offensive into Raffa. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=0.0s)]
*  The Israeli military dropped leaflets urging people in parts of eastern Raffa to evacuate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  immediately. The IDF calls it a limited scope operation. The defense minister earlier told [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=11.76s)]
*  troops to expect intense action in Raffa. Now, many Palestinians are already fleeing the area. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=17.76s)]
*  The southern Gaza city was supposed to be a safe place where more than a million Palestinians have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=24.72s)]
*  taken refuge there after fleeing from other areas. The UN says the area where people have been [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=30.96s)]
*  directed to go is simply not suitable to live. CNN's Arlette Sainz is at the White House, but [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=36.56s)]
*  let's begin with Nick Robertson who's following all the developments from London now. Nick, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=42.239999999999995s)]
*  this Raffa operation was long anticipated. What are you hearing about what Israel is planning to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=48.16s)]
*  say and if this indeed is the ground offensive that Israel has been warning about? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=53.76s)]
*  It has all the hallmarks of a ground offensive and typically when Israel has launched previous [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=59.84s)]
*  ground offensives going into Gaza not long after those horrific October 7th attacks, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=64.64s)]
*  it took many days before we began to get an idea of the scope and scale of the operation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=70.8s)]
*  It was a big operation, but Israel was sort of able to keep it pretty much under wraps remembering [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=76.0s)]
*  journalists like ourselves and other news organizations are not allowed by Israel to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=81.12s)]
*  go into Gaza to freely report and see what's happening. So there's a level of difficulty [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=85.76s)]
*  to understand precisely what's happening in and around Raffa at the moment. But what is clear, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=91.04s)]
*  these leaflets that the IDF are dropping are very similar to leaflets they've dropped at the head [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=99.04s)]
*  prior to other major military operations. They've told Palestinians in about 12 different [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=104.08s)]
*  blocks of housing, that's about 100,000 people the UN estimates, to leave the houses and go to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=112.48s)]
*  an expanded safer area and these leaflets, these flyers that the IDF are dropping, tell the residents [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=118.8s)]
*  there that their area is going to be used as is going to be where an offensive is against terrorists [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=125.6s)]
*  and it says that those terrorists are going to hide among you. It's very clear that when the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=131.52s)]
*  IDF goes in there, the scenarios could be it appears like previous military operations where [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  civilians get caught up in the operations. Now has the operation, military operation, actually begun? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't appear so, but again we're restricted in what we can see and what we can actually [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=150.72s)]
*  get access to report. So we know that the negotiations at the moment are sort of stalled, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=158.08s)]
*  they're not completely broken down, so is this a last ditch pressure effort by Israel on Hamas to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=165.44000000000003s)]
*  cede to their terms? The gap still remains very big at those talks. So what the UN is describing now [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=173.52s)]
*  in and around the area of Raffa where people are being told to go to these areas where there [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=179.84s)]
*  isn't enough food, isn't enough water, isn't enough sanitation, not the right conditions for them to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  go and live and as we've seen in other operations, you won't necessarily be safe in these designated [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  humanitarian safer areas. So the UN is very concerned not just about their welfare, physical [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=196.4s)]
*  but psychological welfare and that this could precipitate panic which could mean in an area [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=202.0s)]
*  where there are about 1.5 million people living, that could be a pretty dire consequence. UNICEF [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=210.16s)]
*  is saying about 600,000 children there face a very uncertain time at this moment. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=218.8s)]
*  Nick Robertson, thank you. Let's head over to the White House now and Arlette Signs. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  What's the view from there and what the Biden administration is saying about all this considering [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=229.84s)]
*  ceasefire talks are ongoing where the CIA Director Bill Burns is in Doha right now trying to broker [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=234.72s)]
*  a deal. Netanyahu has said over and over again that deal or no deal this ground incursion will [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=242.16s)]
*  go forward. Yeah, Amara, there's no question that the White House is watching these latest [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=248.0s)]
*  moves from Israel relating to eastern Raffa incredibly closely. It comes as the administration [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=253.6s)]
*  for months now has warned about a potential ground operation in Raffa with President Biden [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=259.2s)]
*  and others here at the White House stressing to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  that they need to ensure there is a plan in place to ensure the safety and evacuation of the more [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=269.76s)]
*  than 1.4 million Palestinians who are in the Raffa area at this time. Now on Friday we reported that [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=275.84s)]
*  U.S. and Israeli officials had been in conversations about Raffa that Israel provided [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=284.88s)]
*  insight into their thinking relating to the evacuation of Raffa but sources cautions that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=291.28s)]
*  what was presented did not appear to be a final plan that there was no full briefing when it comes [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=297.2s)]
*  to what a military operation would look like. But the White House certainly has been watching this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=303.2s)]
*  with quite a bit of concern as President Biden is also facing domestic pressure here at home [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=308.64s)]
*  relating to the way that Israel has conducted its campaign in Gaza. Now over the weekend we also [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=315.2s)]
*  learned that the U.S. paused a shipment of U.S.-made ammunition to Israel. A source familiar [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=320.64s)]
*  with the matter told us that this was not due to this potential operation into Raffa and that this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  would not impact aid going forward. Big questions about why exactly there was that pause in [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=333.12s)]
*  shipment. Senator Chris Coons, a key member of the Foreign Relations Committee, suggested it could [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=339.12s)]
*  have been logistical issues but this is all playing out as Nick noted against the backdrop of those [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=343.44s)]
*  hostage and ceasefire negotiations that appear to have stalled out over the weekend. CIA Director [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=349.76s)]
*  Bill Burns was on hand in Cairo working as a mediator on this issue. He then traveled on to Doha [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=355.68s)]
*  where he met with the Qatari Prime Minister. He was set to travel to Israel today but is actually [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=362.32s)]
*  remaining in Doha as the administration all last week had really been speaking in quite optimistic [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=366.64s)]
*  tones about the prospect of a deal coming together. But we saw the Israeli and Hamas sides both really [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=373.44s)]
*  blame each other for what they viewed as each other's extreme view. So this is something that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  the White House certainly wants to try to get an agreement on but at the time it appears those [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=385.2s)]
*  conversations are stalled out. Doesn't mean that they won't get on track at some point but also I [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=390.16s)]
*  would note that today President Biden here at the White House will be having lunch with Jordan's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=395.44s)]
*  King Abdullah. Abdullah of course is a key player in the region. He has warned and expressed [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  concerns about the way that this operation has been conducted in Gaza about the humanitarian issues [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=406.72s)]
*  that are on hand there so the president might have a chance to hear directly from King Abdullah about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=412.0s)]
*  his concerns. But all of this comes as you have big questions about what Israel will be doing [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=417.12s)]
*  going forward when it relates to Rafa as the U.S. has been trying to stress that they need to take [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  great care to ensure the safety of civilians there. Yeah so much uncertainty when it comes to the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=427.68s)]
*  fate of the civilians. Arlette Science at the White House thank you very much. Now earlier [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=432.4s)]
*  our Max Foster spoke to Scott Anderson the director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza. UNRWA is a UN agency that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=436.56s)]
*  works to support Palestinian refugees. He is currently in Gaza and he says people need a place [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=442.72s)]
*  to escape the fighting. Our concerns of 1.4 million people that have sought refuge from the violence [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=448.72s)]
*  in Rafa. People need to be given an opportunity to move away from conflict. If they aren't I mean the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=455.44000000000005s)]
*  results would be catastrophic. The impact would be catastrophic to have a fight in such a densely [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  populated neighborhoods that exist throughout Rafa where I sit in Tela Sultan which is one of the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=467.68s)]
*  neighborhoods further to the west. It's incredibly densely populated. You see tents and makeshift [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=472.88s)]
*  plastic structures everywhere. If an operation happened here at any scale it's hard to predict [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=478.0s)]
*  the scale of death other than to say it would be catastrophic and the impact would be catastrophic [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=484.16s)]
*  for people who sought safety here. The Americans have obviously warned against civilian casualties. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=488.8s)]
*  They've given that warning to Israel. How much support are you getting from countries other [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=496.72s)]
*  than Israel in your work to making making sure civilians are looked after? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=503.12s)]
*  I think this is certainly a concern for everybody. I think including Israel that innocent civilians [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  are not harmed in this conflict. We've heard very loudly from the United States as you mentioned but [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  also many countries within the European Union as well as the Gulf states. Is there anybody that's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=520.32s)]
*  a donor here or is active here has the same concern as United Nations and that is we want [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=524.88s)]
*  innocent civilians to be kept safe. We want children to be kept safe and we continue to call [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  on all parties to the conflict to ensure that civilians are safe and not impacted by ongoing [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=535.04s)]
*  hostilities. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr-OKI2NEng&t=540.4s)]
