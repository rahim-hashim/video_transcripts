# Israeli military searches for Hamas leader after surrounding Gaza home
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc)
*  Finally tonight, one of the Israeli military's biggest targets is a top Hamas leader in Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=0.0s)]
*  who's accused of being a mastermind behind the October 7th assault. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=6.0s)]
*  Brian Todd takes a closer look at his background. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=10.0s)]
*  One of Israel's top targets, the man they call the face of evil, Yahya Sinwar, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=13.0s)]
*  Hamas's highest-ranking leader inside Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=21.0s)]
*  Top Israeli officials have sounded very confident in recent days that they'll kill him, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=24.0s)]
*  saying their forces have encircled his house in southern Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=28.0s)]
*  His house is not his fortress and he can escape, but it's only a matter of time until we get him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=31.0s)]
*  Without elaborating, Israeli officials say they believe Sinwar is underground, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=38.0s)]
*  such as the existence of the 61-year-old who's imprinted his hatred of Israel into the identity of Hamas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=43.0s)]
*  Analysts say as one of Hamas's top masterminds of the October 7th attacks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=50.0s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar to Israel is what Bin Laden is to the United States. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=55.0s)]
*  And like Americans went after Bin Laden and eventually got him, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=59.0s)]
*  I think the Israelis will do the same and this war will not end until they get Sinwar. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=62.0s)]
*  Sinwar joined Hamas in his 20s. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=67.0s)]
*  Arrested by the Israelis for the murders of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=70.0s)]
*  he spent 23 years in an Israeli prison, learned Hebrew, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=74.0s)]
*  and it was during that period that the Israelis actually saved his life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=78.0s)]
*  The tumor was discovered in his head. Israeli doctors operated on him, took the tumor out, and he survived. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=82.0s)]
*  Michael Kubi, a former officer of Israel's Shin Bet Security Agency, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=89.0s)]
*  says he interrogated Yahya Sinwar for a total of about 180 hours. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=94.0s)]
*  Kubi says he knows Sinwar better than Sinwar's own mother [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=99.0s)]
*  and describes him as the cruelest man he ever met, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=103.0s)]
*  known to use a machete to kill Palestinians who were suspected of collaborating with Israeli intelligence. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=106.0s)]
*  I asked him, you are now 28, 29, and how come he's not married? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=111.0s)]
*  How come he doesn't want a family? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=118.0s)]
*  So he told me the Hamas is my wife, the Hamas is my child, the Hamas for me is everything. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=121.0s)]
*  Sinwar was among more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners released in 2011 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=128.0s)]
*  in exchange for captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=134.0s)]
*  Just last year, he seemed to warn Israel what was coming. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=137.0s)]
*  We will come to you, God willing, in a roaring flood. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=141.0s)]
*  We will come to you with an endless number of rockets. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=145.0s)]
*  We will come to you in a flood of soldiers without limit. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=148.0s)]
*  We will come to you with millions of our nation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=151.0s)]
*  Analysts say the man who survived an Israeli assassination attempt in 2021 [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=154.0s)]
*  won't be easy to kill this time either. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=158.0s)]
*  If there's someone who's passing on information to the Israelis, he usually knows who they are. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=161.0s)]
*  And he takes them out before the Israelis get to him. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=166.0s)]
*  Analyst Hussain Abdul Hussein says if and when the Israelis eliminate Yahya Sinwar, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=169.0s)]
*  it's unlikely that whoever might try to fill those shoes will be as brutal as Sinwar. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=174.0s)]
*  But even if it's someone more moderate, he says, it really won't matter [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=178.0s)]
*  given how determined that Israel is to take out all of Hamas' leadership. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggKyOAypMdc&t=182.0s)]
