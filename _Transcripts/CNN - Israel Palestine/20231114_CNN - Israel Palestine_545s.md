# Wesley Clark: Israeli’s militarily have to do this
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw)
*  Can you just talk about that a little bit? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=0.0s)]
*  Just from a military standpoint, in all wars, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=1.52s)]
*  when there are civilians around and there are targets [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=4.08s)]
*  that are believed to be of military necessity, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=8.4s)]
*  there are calculations essentially done [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=12.68s)]
*  about how valuable is the target, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=15.74s)]
*  what is the risk of civilian loss, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=19.0s)]
*  and how much civilian loss is acceptable. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=21.72s)]
*  And these are horrible calculations that are, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=24.36s)]
*  but these are calculations that armies make during war. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=26.48s)]
*  A situation like this, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=30.2s)]
*  operating on the grounds in a hospital, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=31.44s)]
*  has got to be extraordinarily difficult. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Sure, and you're exactly right, Anderson, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  about the way you cast it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=39.46s)]
*  You know what the target is, you know how valuable it is, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=41.4s)]
*  you try to estimate what the risks are of hurting civilians, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=44.88s)]
*  and then you have to make the judgment [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=48.88s)]
*  of whether the target, going after the target, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=50.24s)]
*  taking out the target, is worth the risk [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  of injuring people who are innocent [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  and not part of the enemy force. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=57.96s)]
*  But here you're dealing with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=61.04s)]
*  the command and control node of Hamas. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=62.28s)]
*  You're dealing with Hamas that has deliberately, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=65.08s)]
*  cynically located its most valuable assets in a hospital, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=67.48s)]
*  deliberately to try to provoke outrage [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=71.92s)]
*  in the world community and discredit Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=75.32s)]
*  Israelis know this, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=78.28s)]
*  they've got really great intel on this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=79.88s)]
*  When those soldiers go in, in armored vehicles first, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=83.16s)]
*  and then dismounted into the buildings, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=86.76s)]
*  and it is a very complex compound, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  as you saw from the overhead cover. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=91.36s)]
*  They'll have helicopters, they'll have drones overhead, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=93.48s)]
*  they'll be able to mark enemy positions with lasers, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=96.28s)]
*  they'll be able to deliver precise fire [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  if there is an opponent there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=102.72s)]
*  And then they've got to go inside. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  And if Hamas is there, yes, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=107.28s)]
*  there could be a shootout in a hospital corridor, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=110.0s)]
*  and they're going to have to get to the bottom of it, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=112.68s)]
*  and they're going to have to search [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=115.12s)]
*  for the tunnel entrances around it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=116.56s)]
*  So at every step, the soldier on the ground, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=118.84s)]
*  the tank commander and so forth is at risk. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  He's putting himself out there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=126.2s)]
*  He's likely to draw fire. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=128.44s)]
*  He has the right to self-defense, no matter what, always. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=130.96s)]
*  And he's going to respond if he is attacked. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=135.44s)]
*  But he's got a lot of assets backing him up, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=138.8s)]
*  a lot of other eyes on the battlefield. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=140.68s)]
*  So it's everything that can possibly be done [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=142.76s)]
*  to protect civilians and still go after [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=145.84s)]
*  the command and control at the hospital. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=148.44s)]
*  And the Israelis, militarily, they have to do this. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=150.68s)]
*  One of the things I'm surprised there's not more outrage out [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=153.4s)]
*  internationally about is that Hamas had two years, say, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=157.4s)]
*  preparing this attack, or a year, however long it was. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=161.88s)]
*  We don't know the exact amount of time [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=164.92s)]
*  that they've been preparing, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=166.28s)]
*  but certainly they've been preparing for quite some time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=167.16s)]
*  They have not made any effort to build any bomb shelter [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=170.72s)]
*  for any civilian, it seems, in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=173.44s)]
*  They've built tunnels for themselves [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=177.0s)]
*  to store supplies and weapons and to protect themselves. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=179.16s)]
*  But there are not bomb shelters, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=183.4s)]
*  even the kind of shelters that you see on the sides [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=185.16s)]
*  of the road in Israel by bus stops [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=189.2s)]
*  to protect against rockets. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=191.4s)]
*  Those don't exist on the streets of Gaza. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=192.64s)]
*  In your military experience, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=197.04s)]
*  have you seen many countries or territories [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=198.84s)]
*  with a military that does not prepare [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  or have some sort of safe harbor for its civilians? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=208.56s)]
*  Well, no, but on the other hand, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=213.44s)]
*  Hamas deliberately wants these civilians to be at risk. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, that's, I mean, that's the point, yes, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=221.12s)]
*  but I still find it stunning that that doesn't seem [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=222.96s)]
*  to register with a lot of people. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=226.6s)]
*  Well, the thing about it, Anderson, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=230.4s)]
*  is we call Hamas a terrorist organization, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=232.32s)]
*  but it's actually the government of this Gaza Strip. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=235.28s)]
*  They're in charge of everything. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=239.28s)]
*  Right, and they have had received hundreds of millions [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=240.48s)]
*  of dollars from Qatar and other places, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=242.68s)]
*  and they have not built any bomb shelters for their people. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=245.16s)]
*  Right, because they're not interested [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=249.48s)]
*  in protecting their people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=251.64s)]
*  They're interested in provoking international outrage, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=253.4s)]
*  and they're interested in provoking [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  a lot of international outrage against Israel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=259.47999999999996s)]
*  They knew that when they launched this attack, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=262.76s)]
*  and they hope to draw Israel in, bog Israel down, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=265.28s)]
*  cause a lot of casualties, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=269.44s)]
*  do exactly what they're doing with world opinion, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=271.56s)]
*  have a lot of voices out there saying, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=273.96s)]
*  cease fire, cease fire, cease fire, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=275.56s)]
*  and try to stop the Israeli assault, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=277.68s)]
*  and then declare victory. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=280.68s)]
*  That's the goal, and so the more civilian casualties [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=282.79999999999995s)]
*  the better the situation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=287.36s)]
*  I'm also very certain that Hamas [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=288.88s)]
*  believes its chances of success. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=291.04s)]
*  And, Nick, it's accurate to say that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=294.08s)]
*  the health officials in Gaza have denied repeatedly [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=297.48s)]
*  that Al-Shifa Hospital or others are being used by Hamas [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=302.28s)]
*  for any, I don't even wanna call it military purposes, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=307.24s)]
*  I mean, for any of their own purposes. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=312.28s)]
*  health officials in Gaza, Hamas run, health officials say is true for other hospitals there. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=316.44s)]
*  We've been speaking, CNN has been speaking with officials from the hospital over the last few [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=324.6s)]
*  days and just going through our latest information on that, it appears the most recent over the past [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=330.28s)]
*  couple of days data that we have from the hospital itself, from our Shefa hospital, they say there [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=337.24s)]
*  are about 7,000 civilians taking refuge there or there were until recently, it's not clear how many [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=342.92s)]
*  of those might have left and about 1,500 staff, 100 or so doctors, other medical officials and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=349.88s)]
*  included in that 1,500 of course several hundred patients as well as sort of support staff in the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=360.04s)]
*  hospital so it's still a big complex, a complex complex and it still appears a significant number [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  of people working there. You would have to assume that these health officials would have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=373.88s)]
*  knowledge of the whole complex, there's a lot of people there and would have knowledge of the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=381.32s)]
*  nooks and crannies of it if you will, there wouldn't be places that they wouldn't know about [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=387.0s)]
*  within the hospital complex so they continue to say Hamas isn't there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=391.72s)]
*  But I mean that's the ensuring thing about operating, I mean anybody who has operated, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=397.24s)]
*  who has reported from Gaza, you see rockets being fired from civilian areas, you see rockets being [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  fired from the building where you're, the building, the last time I was in Gaza I could see where [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=408.36s)]
*  rockets were being fired from in buildings nearby me, people, even the doctors in the hospitals know [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=415.16s)]
*  Hamas as long as Jihad and others are firing rockets over their hospitals but they don't speak [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=422.12s)]
*  out about it because they don't want to get killed, I mean they obviously nobody speaks out against [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=427.08s)]
*  Hamas for fear of their own safety, maybe they agree with Hamas, maybe they don't and a lot of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=432.2s)]
*  people don't in Gaza, don't like Hamas but people don't speak out but people know, I mean they know [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  where the tunnels locations are or where the the the rockets are being fired from, you can see it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=445.08s)]
*  And this is in a nutshell, people are scared, I mean being when Hamas was voted in by the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=451.64s)]
*  electorate in Gaza to power in 2006, 2007 they went round throwing out windows of high buildings, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  the political opposition and they might have won an election in 2006 but they've maintained [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=472.44s)]
*  control ever since through fear and intimidation, they might have a hardcore base of supporters there [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=478.52s)]
*  who you know who genuinely believe in them but the vast majority of people would not want to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=484.28s)]
*  speak out against them, would fear speaking out against them, like you Anderson, I'd been to Gaza [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=490.76s)]
*  and had those private conversations away from cameras with people who will tell you precisely [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=495.88s)]
*  that we are too afraid to speak out, Hamas has done this to me, Hamas has done that to me and [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LX0UE92QqDw&t=501.56s)]
