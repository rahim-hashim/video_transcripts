# 'Orders of magnitude more difficult': Petraeus on urban combat
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q)
*  retired US Army General David Petraeus, also the former director of the CIA. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  He has a brand new book titled Conflict, the Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  General, always good to have you on. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=11.78s)]
*  One of the things that struck me about the book, which is an area of expertise, which [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=14.82s)]
*  is something that I hope the Israelis are reading, is about urban combat and the 2004 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=19.46s)]
*  Battle of Fallujah, the largest of the Iraq War. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=26.6s)]
*  Bloody, costly, street by street. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  And we had General Kim in here not long ago, and he was saying that what Israel is going [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=34.1s)]
*  to face, what the Israeli forces are going to face in Gaza will be probably even more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=39.52s)]
*  grueling than Fallujah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=47.8s)]
*  Well, it'll be orders of magnitude more difficult. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=48.8s)]
*  The enemy has had months to prepare the defenses. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=51.96s)]
*  Well, undoubtedly, employee improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers, car bombs, tunnels, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  a lot of infrastructure that they have. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=60.96s)]
*  They know the territory very, very well, and it's many times the size of Fallujah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=62.88s)]
*  We did a number of urban operations over those years, and then more recently, we watched [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=67.4s)]
*  one that might be more appropriate as an analogy, which was the Iraqi security forces supported [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  by a US-led coalition clearing the Islamic State out of Mosul, a city about the same [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=77.88s)]
*  size as Gaza City. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=84.5s)]
*  And again, it's very, very challenging fighting. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=86.78s)]
*  In this hospital bombing, and by the way, I'll take the side of the IDF spokesman any [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=89.18s)]
*  day over Hamas, needless to say. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  They're in a democracy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=97.68s)]
*  The truth is going to come out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=98.68s)]
*  They know it, and they've done apparently a very good and thorough investigation quite [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=99.78s)]
*  quickly. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=104.58s)]
*  But in the case of urban combat, you're going to have tremendous damage to civilian infrastructure. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=105.58s)]
*  You're going to have considerable civilian loss. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=111.94s)]
*  You're going to take a lot of friendly casualties. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=114.5s)]
*  You don't just have to clear every building, floor, room, basement, tunnel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  You have to leave substantial forces behind or else the enemy will re-infiltrate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=122.98s)]
*  You have to do this progressively, sequentially. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  You have to clear and hold and then continue farther, spread the oil spot. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=129.78s)]
*  In fact, it really should be thought of as a counterinsurgency operation, not just a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=134.54s)]
*  conventional military operation because you are fighting among the people and because [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=139.18s)]
*  of the importance of not overlooking what happens after Hamas is destroyed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=143.58s)]
*  And by the way, the spokesman today said they also intend to dismantle the Hamas political [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=150.22s)]
*  structure, the political wing that's different from the military wing, which is the Hamas [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=155.38s)]
*  terrorists and also the Islamic Jihad terrorists. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=160.18s)]
*  But then the question is what next? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=163.14000000000001s)]
*  Who's going to take over? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=165.02s)]
*  Who's going to oversee? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=166.02s)]
*  There has to be nation building. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=168.26s)]
*  There's going to be restoration of basic services, repair of damaged infrastructure, getting [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=169.66s)]
*  schools, markets, clinics all reopened. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=174.46s)]
*  You know that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=176.82s)]
*  We've learned all that sometimes the hard way. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=177.82s)]
*  We learned in the fight to Baghdad that you've got to have a very good plan with a lot of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=179.9s)]
*  different assumptions because once you take down the regime and you turn to the folks [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  that said just get us to Baghdad, Dave, we'll take it from there, that plan proved inadequate. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=189.46s)]
*  So I think the big subject of discussion, I suspect already between the Israeli generals [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=194.4s)]
*  and the political authorities is about what comes after. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=200.96s)]
*  They're going to take enormous casualties to do this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=205.8s)]
*  I believe that it's right to destroy Hamas, but you can't have that for naught. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=209.36s)]
*  This can't be another case where you mow the lawn all the way down to the dirt in this [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=215.24s)]
*  case, but then you pull back out and the remnants will be able to reconstitute themselves. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=219.16s)]
*  So what follows? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=223.66s)]
*  Could there be an interim international authority? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=224.66s)]
*  What is it? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=226.56s)]
*  I doubt. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=227.56s)]
*  I mean, the ambassador told me Sunday that they do not want to reoccupy Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=228.56s)]
*  No. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=234.3s)]
*  And the president has said don't do it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=235.3s)]
*  So it has to be some other. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=237.62s)]
*  So what is that solution? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  The United Nations or the Arab League or some group. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  But they're going to have to fight because there will be an insurgency. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=243.18s)]
*  They'll try to retake control the remnants of Gaza and there will be of Hamas, there [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=247.1s)]
*  will be some of those there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=251.3s)]
*  So this is the real challenge, Jake, and I'm not sure it's getting quite enough attention. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=252.54s)]
*  In the book, we talk about the importance of a strategic leader getting the big ideas [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=257.9s)]
*  right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=262.02s)]
*  This is crucial, getting the strategy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=263.02s)]
*  Vengeance is not a strategy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=265.3s)]
*  And that's my next question. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=266.65999999999997s)]
*  Military component is some, but you have to do more. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  And that's my next question because I've been thinking about how, and understandably [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=269.78s)]
*  so, but how immediate and swift the response by the Israeli military was in the aftermath [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=274.38s)]
*  of Hamas' barbaric terrorist attack on October 7th, which of course reminds me of 9-11. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=280.38s)]
*  And you remember when I interviewed you when I did the documentary about 20 years of war [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=287.62s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=292.3s)]
*  And I also interviewed General McChrystal for that same documentary. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=294.82s)]
*  And he told me something interesting and I want to get your take on it because I said [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=299.62s)]
*  if you could go back, what would you do differently? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=303.74s)]
*  Listen to your colleague and friend, General McChrystal. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=307.38s)]
*  Right after the 9-11 attacks, I would have made a decision inside the U.S. government [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=311.7s)]
*  to do nothing substantive for a year. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=315.9s)]
*  What I mean by nothing, no bombing, no strikes, etc. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=319.78s)]
*  I would have gone around the world as the aggrieved party and built up a firm coalition [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=323.38s)]
*  for what ought we do about Al-Qaeda. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  I would have done a mass effort to train Americans in Arabic, Pashto, Urdu, Dari, to get ourselves [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=331.34s)]
*  ready to do something that we knew would be very, very difficult. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=341.26s)]
*  Now I said to him, if you were president, you also would be impeached for not doing [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=346.14s)]
*  anything after the 9-11 attacks. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=352.29999999999995s)]
*  But he has a point. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=353.58s)]
*  But he has a point. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=354.58s)]
*  He does have a point. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=355.58s)]
*  And I want you to talk about that, about the idea of you get horrifically hit, but you [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=356.82s)]
*  take a breath before responding. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=362.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=364.41999999999996s)]
*  Look, keep in mind, this is much worse than 9-11 in relative terms. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  It's like 35,000 people being killed. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=368.7s)]
*  Jake, it's actually over 40,000 now because they're up to 1,300. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=371.02s)]
*  So yes. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  And so that response, the desire for vengeance is absolutely understandable. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=376.14s)]
*  And there should be vengeance. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=380.9s)]
*  There should be destruction of the organization that did this, but not if you haven't thought [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=382.82s)]
*  through what comes after that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=387.86s)]
*  And that's, I think, the component of this that certainly is not yet visible. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=389.74s)]
*  I'm sure that they're wrestling with this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=393.94s)]
*  I'm sure part of the reason the president is then going to Amman, Jordan is to start [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=395.58s)]
*  discussing that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=399.82s)]
*  And one would hope that some of the Arab countries in particular in the region that have often [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=401.28s)]
*  expressed sympathy for the Palestinians will contribute to some kind of effort that would [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=405.94s)]
*  enable the rebuilding. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=413.02s)]
*  And so, and Prime Minister Netanyahu, I think, should provide a vision for what life will [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=415.38s)]
*  be like for the Palestinian people, not just in Gaza, by the way, but also in the West [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=421.86s)]
*  Bank, something that has just been looming out there for quite some time in any event. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=426.94s)]
*  Let's let this be a catalyst. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=431.62s)]
*  After the 73 war, all of a sudden you had peace between the two warring factions, between [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=433.78s)]
*  Egypt and Israel, and arrangements with Syria and Jordan as well. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=440.26s)]
*  Of course, a very different situation. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=444.53999999999996s)]
*  Henry Kissinger, I was just in a meeting with him. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=446.18s)]
*  He could call four people and get that deal done. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=449.12s)]
*  President of Egypt, Assad in Damascus, the king in Amman, and Golda Meir. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=452.34s)]
*  There's nobody here to do that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=459.14s)]
*  This is much more challenging in that regard. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=461.18s)]
*  And I'd contend that the military task here is more challenging as well. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=463.70000000000005s)]
*  It's not tank on tank out in the desert. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=467.98s)]
*  Certainly there was an existential moment for Israel when Egypt achieved the early success. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYtxWLVwH_Q&t=470.70000000000005s)]
