# Why retired general thinks hostage exchange is a 'net loss' for Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU)
*  Let's bring in now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is General Wesley Clark, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=1.48s)]
*  a former NATO NATO Supreme Allied [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=3.12s)]
*  Commander and CNN military analyst general. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=5.16s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=7.84s)]
*  I just want to first start [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=8.56s)]
*  before I ask you a question. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  We've just gotten update from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=11.44s)]
*  Israeli officials on the number of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=13.24s)]
*  hostages they believe are still [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=15.6s)]
*  being held by Hamas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=17.32s)]
*  That number is 201. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=18.68s)]
*  They they know that this is [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=22.56s)]
*  inconsistent with the number [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=25.68s)]
*  that has happened before, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=27.2s)]
*  but these numbers, as you know, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=28.16s)]
*  and our viewers can understand, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=29.92s)]
*  fluctuate based on information coming in. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=31.8s)]
*  So Israel now believes there are [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=34.2s)]
*  201 hostages taken October 7th, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=36.68s)]
*  who are still in Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=38.92s)]
*  Let me ask you about the strategy [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=41.28s)]
*  moving forward and what the military [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  is gaining and losing during this period. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  The surveillance drones for a period [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  are not flying over Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=53.92s)]
*  They're not bombing the tunnels [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=56.120000000000005s)]
*  as they have been for seven weeks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=58.8s)]
*  At the end of this truce. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=61.68s)]
*  Is it a net gain or loss as it [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  relates to that mission of ending Hamas? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=66.6s)]
*  They'll lose potentially some [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=69.8s)]
*  intelligence but gain some from the hostages. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=71.24s)]
*  What do you see we get at the end of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=73.67999999999999s)]
*  this from the Israeli perspective? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  I think from the military perspective [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  in Israel it's it's a net loss and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=81.24s)]
*  military in Israel is going to look [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=84.24s)]
*  at it as first Hamas is has been [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=87.0s)]
*  dedicated to the destruction of Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=90.24s)]
*  They proved they're willing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=92.76s)]
*  to go very far along this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=94.28s)]
*  They are considered an existential threat. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=96.64s)]
*  And if Israelis military looked to the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=99.2s)]
*  North and they see Hezbollah and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=102.04s)]
*  they ask themselves if Hamas gets [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=104.72s)]
*  away with this and survives this, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=107.28s)]
*  what will that say to Hezbollah? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=109.76s)]
*  And what can Hezbollah do on the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=112.16s)]
*  on the North to Israel if they decide [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=114.84s)]
*  to follow the same tactics? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=117.72s)]
*  And so there's a lot riding on this, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=119.56s)]
*  but the Israeli military has got [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=121.88s)]
*  to listen to political authorities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=123.92s)]
*  There's a lot of political pressure [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=125.92s)]
*  coming from Washington and also [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  from the Israeli public. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=129.72s)]
*  Get those hostages free, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=131.28s)]
*  then we'll worry about what happens next. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=133.16s)]
*  Hamas knows this Hamas is playing it like a fiddle. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=135.96s)]
*  They release hostages. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=140.24s)]
*  They're prepared to squeeze if they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=141.8s)]
*  don't get exactly what they want. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=144.0s)]
*  They want more food. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=145.72s)]
*  They want more fuel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=146.84s)]
*  They ultimately want global opinion [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=148.0s)]
*  to an Israeli opinion to halt [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=151.4s)]
*  the Israeli military operations. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=155.76s)]
*  Hamas then emerges victorious. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=158.28s)]
*  They're a hero in the Islamic world, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=161.12s)]
*  or at least in the Palestinian view, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=164.04s)]
*  and this then gives them a major victory. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=166.28s)]
*  Israel maybe gets its people back, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=170.32s)]
*  maybe not all of them, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=173.16s)]
*  and Israel shutters Israeli military shutters, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  thinking what's going to happen next, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=178.48s)]
*  especially if Iran gets a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=181.12s)]
*  So if you think this truth is a net loss for the IDF, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=184.28s)]
*  let me ask you plainly, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  do you think the President Biden is wrong [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=188.04s)]
*  in his suggestion that this truth should be extended [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=191.68s)]
*  at the end of the four days? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=197.04s)]
*  Well, I think President Biden is walking [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=200.76s)]
*  a narrow line. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=204.12s)]
*  On the one hand, our military and the Israeli military [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=204.96s)]
*  know what needs to be done with Hamas, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=208.16s)]
*  but it is ugly. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=210.52s)]
*  It's causing civilian casualties. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=212.72s)]
*  There's no way to go after Hamas [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=214.84s)]
*  without inflicting certain amount of casualties [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=217.28s)]
*  on civilians who are not Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=220.84s)]
*  And so this puts a lot of pressure on the United States. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=223.8s)]
*  We've got other global objectives. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  We're not solely dedicated to Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=230.12s)]
*  We've got to worry about our relationship with allies, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=233.84s)]
*  relationships in the region, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=236.56s)]
*  and our longer objective, longer term, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=238.08s)]
*  was to get the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=240.52s)]
*  and others in the region aligned with Israel [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=243.44s)]
*  so that we could end this issue. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  So we've got the longer term to think about. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a tough position for the President. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=251.0s)]
*  Gotta get the American hostages out, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=253.64000000000001s)]
*  try to prevail on the Israelis [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=256.16s)]
*  to limit the damage to civilians. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=258.32s)]
*  Ultimately, the Israelis have to decide, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=261.2s)]
*  are they going after the destruction of Hamas at all costs, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=264.04s)]
*  or do they have to balance this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=268.96s)]
*  with their relationship with the West, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=270.68s)]
*  and especially with the United States? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=272.64s)]
*  And is the destruction of Hamas even an achievable goal? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=274.56s)]
*  The political and military angle of it may end, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=278.08s)]
*  but the ideology, could it come back? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=281.44s)]
*  Will it come back in some other name or form? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=283.56s)]
*  General Wesley Clark, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCgcvGM2QUU&t=285.48s)]
