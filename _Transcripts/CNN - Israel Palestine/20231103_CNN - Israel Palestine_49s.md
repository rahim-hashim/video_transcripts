**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc)
*  This is where we saw all those videos, especially around the town of Betanun, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc&t=0.0s)]
*  which is in northeastern Gaza. This is the area of main concentration that the Israelis were [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc&t=4.96s)]
*  working on in this particular moment in time, and then they're moving south into Gaza City. So, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc&t=11.28s)]
*  this is where they'll be going, and this is where that grand encirclement is taking place right here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc&t=16.8s)]
*  So, you have all these troops that have come in from the north. They've come in also around [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc&t=22.96s)]
*  Jabalia, and then they're moving into Gaza City, and they're doing this in several different [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc&t=28.72s)]

*  but they're also coming in in a way that will allow them to stop, gain whole territory, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc&t=40.96s)]
*  then move forward into different areas. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx2pCaaFtwc&t=47.120000000000005s)]
