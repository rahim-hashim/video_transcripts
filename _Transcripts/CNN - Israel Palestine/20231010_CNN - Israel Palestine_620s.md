# Biden: Hamas attack on Israel is ‘an act of sheer evil’
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco)
*  We're watching President Biden as he approaches the podium at the White House. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Let's listen to his remarks. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=3.2s)]
*  You know, there are moments in this life, and I mean this literally, when the pure, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=5.44s)]
*  unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=11.44s)]
*  The people of Israel lived through one such moment this weekend. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=18.0s)]
*  The bloody hands of the terrorist organization, Amos, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=23.92s)]
*  a group who stayed at purpose for being, is to kill Jews. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=27.68s)]
*  This was an act of sheer evil. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  More than 1,000 civilians slaughtered, not just killed, slaughtered in Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=37.28s)]
*  Among them, at least 14 American citizens killed. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=44.72s)]
*  Parents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  Stomach-turning reports of babies being killed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  Entire families slain. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  Young people massacred while attending a musical festival to celebrate peace. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  To celebrate peace. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=64.56s)]
*  Women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=66.88s)]
*  Families hid their fear for hours and hours desperately trying to keep their children quiet [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=70.64s)]
*  to avoid drawing attention. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=77.84s)]
*  And thousands of wounded. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=79.36s)]
*  Alive but carrying with them the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds and the memory [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=82.0s)]
*  of what they endured. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=86.64s)]
*  You all know these traumas never go away. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=89.12s)]
*  There's still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=92.48s)]
*  Not knowing if they're alive or dead or hostages. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=97.28s)]
*  Infants in their mother's arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust survivors abducted. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=101.68s)]
*  Hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute in violation of every code of human morality. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  It's abhorrent. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=113.6s)]
*  The brutality of Hamas, his bloodthirstiness brings to mind the worst, the worst rampages of ISIS. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  This is terrorism. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=126.24s)]
*  But sadly for the Jewish people, the Jewish people are the ones who are the most vulnerable. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=128.56s)]
*  Sadly for the Jewish people, it's not new. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=134.88s)]
*  This attack has brought to the surface painful memories. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  The scars left by a millennia of anti-Semitism and genocide of the Jewish people. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=143.2s)]
*  So in this moment, we must be crystal clear. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=151.84s)]
*  We stand with Israel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=156.24s)]
*  We stand with Israel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=159.68s)]
*  And we will make sure Israel has what it needs to take care of its citizens, defend itself, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=161.28s)]
*  and respond to this attack. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=168.16s)]
*  There's no justification for terrorism. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=170.64s)]
*  There's no excuse. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=173.52s)]
*  Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=176.56s)]
*  The state of purpose is the annihilation of the state of Israel on the murder of Jewish people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=182.8s)]
*  They use Palestinian civilians as human shields. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=187.2s)]
*  Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed with no regard to who pays the price. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  The loss of innocent life is heartbreaking. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  Like every nation in the world, Israel has the right to respond, and indeed has a duty to respond [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=205.76s)]
*  to these vicious attacks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=211.92s)]
*  I just got off the phone with a third call with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=213.52s)]
*  I told him the United States experience that Israel is experiencing, our response to be swift, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=218.96s)]
*  decisive, and overwhelming. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=224.88s)]
*  We also discussed how democracies like Israel and the United States are stronger and more secure [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  when we act according to the rule of law. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Terrorists, perfect, perfect terrorists, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  purposely target civilians, kill them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  We uphold the laws of war, the law of war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=247.44s)]
*  It matters. There's a difference. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=251.04s)]
*  Today, Americans across the country are praying for all those families that have been ripped apart. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  A lot of us know how it feels when it leaves a black hole in your chest when you lose family. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=261.6s)]
*  Feeling like you're being sucked in. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=267.36s)]
*  The anger, the pain, the sense of hopelessness. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=269.28s)]
*  This is what they mean by a human tragedy, an atrocity on an appalling scale. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  We're going to continue to stand united, supporting the people of Israel who are suffering [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=287.52s)]
*  unspeakable losses and opposing the hatred and violence of terrorism. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=292.4s)]
*  My team has been in near constant communication with our Israeli partners [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=303.03999999999996s)]
*  and partners all across the region and the world from the moment this crisis began. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=307.76s)]
*  We're surging additional military assistance, including ammunition [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  and interceptors, to replenish Iron Dome. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=316.79999999999995s)]
*  We're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=319.59999999999997s)]
*  to defend its cities and its citizens. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=323.84s)]
*  My administration has consulted closely with Congress throughout this crisis. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=327.28s)]
*  When Congress returns, we're going to ask them to take urgent action [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=333.44s)]
*  to fund the national security requirements of our critical partners. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  This is not about party or politics. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=342.56s)]
*  This is about the security of our world, the security of the United States of America. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=345.12s)]
*  We now know that American citizens are among those being held by Hamas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=352.48s)]
*  I've directed my team to share intelligence and deploy additional experts from across [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=358.88s)]
*  the United States government to consult with and advise Israeli counterparts [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=363.04s)]
*  on hostage recovery efforts. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=368.8s)]
*  Because as President, I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=371.36s)]
*  around the world. The United States has also enhanced our military force posture in the region [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  to strengthen our deterrence. The Department of Defense has moved the USS Gerald R. Ford [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=385.6s)]
*  Carrier Strike Group to the eastern Mediterranean and bolstered our fighter aircraft presence. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=393.12s)]
*  And we stand ready to move in additional assets as needed. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me say again to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=404.4s)]
*  situation, I have one word. Don't. Don't. Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=410.71999999999997s)]
*  Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, and UK. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  To discuss the latest developments with our European allies and coordinate our united response. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=428.56s)]
*  This comes on top of days of steady engagement with partners across the region. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=435.68s)]
*  We're also taking steps at home. In cities across the United States of America, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=442.32s)]
*  police departments have stepped up. Security around centers for Jewish life. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=447.52s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working closely [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=452.0s)]
*  with state and local law enforcement and Jewish community partners to identify and disrupt [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=456.72s)]
*  any domestic threat that could emerge in connection with these horrific attacks. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=461.20000000000005s)]
*  This is a moment for the United States to come together to grieve with those who are mourning. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=467.68s)]
*  Let's be real clear. There is no place for hate in America. Not against Jews, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  not against Muslims, not against anybody. We reject, we reject, what we reject is terrorism. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=483.36s)]
*  We condemn the indiscriminate evil, just as we've always done. That's what America stands for. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=492.56s)]
*  You know, just over 50 years ago, I was thinking about this morning talking to the Secretary of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  State, the Vice President of my office. Over 50 years ago, as a young senator, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=504.32000000000005s)]
*  I visited Israel for the first time as a newly elected senator. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=511.6s)]
*  And I had a long, long trip, a meeting with Golda Meir in her office, just before the Yom Kippur War. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  And I guess you could see the consternation on my face as she described what was being faced. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  She said they were facing. We walked outside in that sort of hallway outside her office [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  to have some photos. She looked at me all of a sudden and said, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  would you like to have a photograph? And so I got up and followed her out. We were standing there [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=548.64s)]
*  silent, looking at the press. She could tell, I guess I was concerned. She leaned over and [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=555.52s)]
*  whispered to me. She said, don't worry, Senator Biden. We have a secret weapon here in Israel. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=561.44s)]
*  My word is what she said. We have no place else to go. We have no place else to go. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=569.44s)]
*  For 75 years, Israel has stood as the only guarantor of the security of Jewish people [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  around the world so that atrocities of the past could never happen again. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=586.0s)]
*  And let there be no doubt the United States has Israel's back. We will make sure the Jewish and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=591.6800000000001s)]
*  democratic state of Israel can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have. It's as simple as that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  These atrocities have been sickening. We're with Israel. Let's make no mistake. Thank you. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQLlo89kaco&t=607.0400000000001s)]
