*  And now the region and the world waits to see whether this will escalate further. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=18.04s)]
*  With us now Jeremy Diamond who's on the scene in the Golan Heights and Ben Wideman in the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=23.64s)]
*  Lebanese capital of Beirut. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=27.68s)]
*  Jeremy let's start first with you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  We know the international community is urging restraint on both sides. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=31.0s)]
*  What are Israeli leaders saying right now? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=34.88s)]
*  Well Jessica there's no question that there is a flurry of diplomatic activity right now [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=37.2s)]
*  trying to de-escalate these tensions, trying to ensure that the Israeli response to what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=42.72s)]
*  they say was a Hezbollah strike right here behind me on this soccer field will be a limited [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=48.4s)]
*  response. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=54.28s)]
*  Israeli officials have not indicated yet how limited that response will be but they have [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=56.08s)]
*  made clear that there will be a response, that there will be a price to pay for this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  attack that killed 12 children in this community of Majdal Shams. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=64.72s)]
*  The Israeli security cabinet met this evening once Prime Minister Netanyahu returned to [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=70.88s)]
*  Israel from the United States authorizing him and the Defense Minister Yoav Golan to [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=76.08s)]
*  move forward with a strike at a time and with a scope of their choosing so remains to be [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=82.64s)]
*  seen how quickly that will actually come together but right now this is a community that not [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=87.84s)]
*  only is anticipating the possibility of that Israeli response waiting to see what will [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  unfold from the events that have happened here but it is also very much still a community [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=98.64s)]
*  in mourning. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=103.84s)]
*  It is just after midnight here in Majdal Shams and you can see behind me that there are you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=104.84s)]
*  know several dozen teenagers who have come here to just sit together to speak to mourn [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=110.28s)]
*  quietly and to take in all that has happened over the course of these last two days. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=116.4s)]
*  Flowers have now been set up where that crater still stands, lights have also been put up. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=124.04s)]
*  This is a very small tight-knit Syrian Druze community and they are definitely all feeling [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=130.06s)]
*  impact of what has happened, an attack that has shaken this community to its core and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=136.84s)]
*  in many ways shattered its very soul. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=142.68s)]
*  Jessica? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=145.68s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, alright, thanks so much for that reporting. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=146.68s)]
*  And Ben, this has the Lebanese government in a tenuous spot, how are they responding? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=150.0s)]
*  Yes, the Lebanese government is, this really underscores Jessica just how weak the Lebanese [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=157.04s)]
*  government is in trying to determine the course of events. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=165.16s)]
*  Hezbollah has in terms of military strength has far more firepower than the Lebanese army [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=169.56s)]
*  itself. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=178.56s)]
*  Now we spoke today to the caretaker Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Abu Habib who made [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=179.56s)]
*  it clear that the worry of the Lebanese government is that if Israel attacks Lebanon and Hezbollah [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=185.88s)]
*  in particular, that it could easily spiral into a regional war. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=193.08s)]
*  You know, not because of conviction, but because of any attack on our country, we support Hezbollah [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=200.08s)]
*  in this regard. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=210.12s)]
*  But it's not going to be Hezbollah alone as I mentioned. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=211.12s)]
*  Iran, Foreign Minister said it yesterday, it wouldn't be Hezbollah alone. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  And of course, the concern here is that if that happens, life, which at the moment is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=219.44s)]
*  actually going on very much normally. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  a disco party. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=242.68s)]
*  It's Sunday evening, but people are enjoying the cool evening temperatures. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=244.4s)]
*  A little while ago, we heard some very loud bangs rushed out, wondering if this was the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=251.24s)]
*  much anticipated Israeli attack. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=257.8s)]
*  No, it was actually fireworks just above our head. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=260.6s)]
*  Several airlines have either delayed or canceled flights into Beirut in fear of an imminent [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=266.28s)]
*  Israeli attack. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=272.88s)]
*  And the U.S. embassy today reissued a statement strongly urging U.S. nationals to reconsider [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=273.88s)]
*  travel to Lebanon. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=282.08s)]
*  Now, I was at the airport today, I arrived in Beirut, and what I saw was there was a [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  very long line of people waiting to enter the country. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Many of those from the Lebanese diaspora, many of them with American passports. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=294.6s)]
*  Jessica? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=301.0s)]
*  All right, Ben Weidem in for us live in Beirut tonight. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=302.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for that reporting. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  I first want to ask just your reaction to this attack on the Golan Heights and what [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=306.0s)]
*  we've seen from Israel in response so far. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=310.72s)]
*  I mean, yet another heinous attack by an Iranian proxy, right? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=313.0s)]
*  I mean, 12 children, teenagers killed on a soccer field, just barbaric. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=317.6s)]
*  Yet another, the deadliest attack on Israel since October 7th. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=324.0s)]
*  So it's yet again, I mean, we've seen 5,000 attacks now from Hezbollah into Israel since [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=328.8s)]
*  October 8th. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=336.8s)]
*  So this is just an ongoing, these are just ongoing attacks, this one particularly heinous. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=338.3s)]
*  And so Jessica, I think what this shows us is of Iran and its continued attack on our [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  allies, but also on democracy in the United States. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=351.8s)]
*  As the foreign minister recently, one of the foreign ministers recently said from Hezbollah [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  said Israel is merely a tool. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=360.8s)]
*  The main war, the real war is with America. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=362.8s)]
*  And I think that's important context that you bring up that Hezbollah has been firing [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=366.5s)]
*  rockets into Israel at the northern border for months now that this has been ongoing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=370.1s)]
*  It has been a deep concern, especially from U.S. officials, that this particular region [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=375.0s)]
*  could escalate, that that conflict could escalate. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=380.54s)]
*  What do you think is the appropriate U.S. response to the current escalation? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=384.04s)]
*  I think the United States, as it did today, has to continue to work very closely with [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=389.04s)]
*  Israel in deciding what's the appropriate response here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=394.54s)]
*  So we'll leave it to them to work that through. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=399.44s)]
*  But the bottom line is when there's an attack on a nation, an attack on Israel, yet again, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=402.46000000000004s)]
*  with, of course, the loss of 12 and 40, I think more than 40 wounded, you realize that [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=408.14s)]
*  it does merit a response. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  So we'll leave it to them to work together on that response. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=415.5s)]
*  But Jessica, the bigger point here is whether you're talking about the Houthis and their [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=418.64s)]
*  attack on Israel, but also on the United States, on our service members, other Iranian-backed [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=423.09999999999997s)]
*  proxies in Iraq and Syria continue to attack the United States and our service members [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=429.7s)]
*  around the world. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=435.3s)]
*  What you see here is terror at its worst. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=437.02000000000004s)]
*  And that's really what Hamas and Hezbollah and all and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=440.38s)]
*  others and the Houthis. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  That's what this is about. It's an attack not just on Israel, but an attack on democracy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=445.98s)]
*  Last night, I spoke with the former Israeli Prime Minister, Naftali Bennett. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=450.82s)]
*  He told us the following. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=454.22s)]
*  I'll play this clip with respect to Lebanon's responsibility for Hezbollah. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=456.02000000000004s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=460.34000000000003s)]
*  We are not going to tweezer our way through and look for Hezbollah amid Lebanon. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=462.02000000000004s)]
*  Hezbollah is part of the government. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=468.58000000000004s)]
*  Hezbollah is part of Lebanon. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=470.1s)]
*  And what Lebanon needs to do tonight is move all of Hezbollah away from the border, all [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=472.62s)]
*  the way up to the river of Lethany, and stop everything they're doing. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=480.26s)]
*  That is the only way they can prevent an all-out war. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=486.06s)]
*  So, Congressman, what is your response to that? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=491.38s)]
*  Again, kind of helping people understand that Hezbollah operates within Lebanon. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=493.62s)]
*  There's also a Lebanese government. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=498.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=501.46000000000004s)]
*  And Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, right on the border of Israel, after the attack of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  October 7th, Israelis pulled back from the border after the attack started from Hezbollah [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=509.66s)]
*  in southern Lebanon. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=515.4200000000001s)]
*  More than 80,000 have been displaced. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=516.9s)]
*  They haven't been able to go home since October 7th. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=519.1400000000001s)]
*  They've left their homes in the northern part of Israel, right on the border of Lebanon, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=522.22s)]
*  because of the attacks coming in from Hezbollah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=525.74s)]
*  And people want to go home, right? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=528.3000000000001s)]
*  Many of them want to go home. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=529.98s)]
*  School is starting in a few weeks for the students there in Israel. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=531.3800000000001s)]
*  They haven't been displaced. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=534.62s)]
*  And so that's a big issue in Israel right now. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=537.1800000000001s)]
*  How do we get them home? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=539.7800000000001s)]
*  And Hezbollah has not pulled back from that border. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K-aUvgP8sE&t=541.34s)]
