# Ceasefire negotiator explains how he worked out deal between Israel-Hezbollah
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI)
*  In our world lead, almost a full day now into the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=0.0s)]
*  and some people in southern Lebanon, are at along the Israeli border, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=3.92s)]
*  are now returning to their homes after months of conflict. But a CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=7.44s)]
*  from northern Israel just because there is a deal doesn't mean that everyone feels safe going back. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=12.4s)]
*  So you're back in Shtula with all the dogs? Yeah. I'm at home. It's not really home at the moment. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=19.76s)]
*  Ori El Yahou is one of just a handful of residents living in this Israeli community [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  along the Lebanese border. But he's not back because he thinks it's safe. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=30.48s)]
*  So basically not, not, it's not just that this is Lebanon, Jabal Blatt, you see here the mountain, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=34.96s)]
*  there the mountain? Yeah. Those houses are Hezbollah's houses. They are shooting missiles from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=40.16s)]
*  there. The new ceasefire agreement means Hezbollah must withdraw from this area, about 25 miles [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  north of the Israeli border. But like many others in northern Israel, Ori doesn't trust Hezbollah, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=51.68s)]
*  nor the Israeli government's assurances that it will prevent Hezbollah from regrouping. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=57.6s)]
*  On the first day of this new ceasefire, Shtula is just as much of a ghost town as when we visited [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=62.72s)]
*  over the summer. Let's go quick. Back then, the Israeli military gave us just three minutes to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=68.32s)]
*  see homes struck by anti-tank missiles, fearing Hezbollah could strike again. I remember when I [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=74.16s)]
*  came here with today, overlooking that same view standing along that same devastated home, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=80.0s)]
*  that threat seems further away. But for how long? Your fear is that this agreement won't prevent [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=85.92s)]
*  this from happening again. You are saying it's a fear. It's not fear. It's not fear. It's effect. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Here in the Middle East, this is how you go. This is how things work. If a terrorist can shoot you, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  he'll shoot you. He says his neighbors, among the roughly 60,000 Israelis displaced from the north, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=106.4s)]
*  don't feel safe enough to return. They won't do it. We are speaking about it all the time in the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  WhatsApp group and in the phone. Anyway, they are not stupid. Just down the road, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  Ora Hatan is enjoying her first peaceful day in more than a year. We woke up today quiet morning. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=123.76s)]
*  It's after one year. It's unusual. She too is skeptical that the ceasefire will lead to a [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=130.48s)]
*  lasting peace, but she doesn't see an alternative. I spoke with the soldier. They tire. They exhaust. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  Also, what another option that we have to arrive to Beirut? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=147.6s)]
*  On the Lebanese side of the border, many civilians were quick to return to southern Lebanon. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=155.92s)]
*  Yes, thank God. I'm happy. Of course, we're going back to our hometown, to our land. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  The Lebanese military also headed south, expected to monitor Hezbollah activity as a fragile truce [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=171.2s)]
*  takes hold. And Erica, while that fragile truce has held up so far, that doesn't mean it's been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  entirely quiet. While we were on the Israel Lebanon border today, we heard at least one burst [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=185.6s)]
*  of outgoing artillery fire and also some small arms fire in the distance. The Israeli military [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=190.4s)]
*  indeed now confirming that it has not only fired warning shots at individuals who are approaching [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=196.88s)]
*  their military positions in southern Lebanon, but actually eliminated, they say, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=201.6s)]
*  Hezbollah operatives in the area. They say that any armed Hezbollah operative is a violation [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=205.68s)]
*  of the ceasefire and that they will enforce that ceasefire themselves. Erica. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=210.64s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, appreciate it. Thank you. Joining me now, Amos Hockstein, who's the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=215.44s)]
*  lead U.S. negotiator behind that ceasefire deal, traveling to the region several times. So as we [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  just heard in Jeremy's piece there, not only what we're hearing from the Israeli military in terms [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  of those warning shots, but you heard from two residents from Ori and also from Aura who are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  skeptical that this ceasefire will hold. Are you confident it will hold? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=235.92s)]
*  First, Erica, thank you for having me. Look, the ceasefire that was agreed to yesterday, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=240.72s)]
*  this is a, we're in a day one of the ceasefire. So I and others will hold judgment. The hope is [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=245.27999999999997s)]
*  that this is a permanent ceasefire that is not just a cessation of hostilities on a temporary basis. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=252.88s)]
*  I saw a lot of reports that this is a 60 day ceasefire. It is not. It is a permanent ceasefire [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=261.36s)]
*  that will require Hezbollah to move away from the border. But Israeli positions inside Lebanon [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=266.56s)]
*  are going to continue to be there for a few more weeks and will, as they depart Lebanon on a [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=272.48s)]
*  gradual basis. So the Lebanese military will now come in and as they deploy to the south, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=277.76s)]
*  the Israeli military will redeploy back into Israel. And look, there's a lot of military gains [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  that were achieved here, but at some point you have to translate those gains into an agreement [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=291.12s)]
*  the government of Israel felt that this was the right time, as did the Lebanese. And so this [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=295.92s)]
*  ceasefire came about. Can you take us inside these final hours of these negotiations? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=300.8s)]
*  Well, it was a very tense last couple of weeks of these negotiations. I went to Beirut, stayed an [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=307.12s)]
*  extra day and then went to Israel and came back over the weekend where we still had some things [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=314.64s)]
*  to do. President Biden made a number of critical phone calls to leaders in order to be able to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=320.56s)]
*  secure it. But as I said before, we've had a ceasefire that in 2006 that ended the last war. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=326.88s)]
*  It was not implemented and neither side did any implementation, especially Hezbollah building [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=334.64s)]
*  terrorist infrastructure across the border. And so we were determined not to just have a [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=340.88s)]
*  ceasefire, but a comprehensive agreement that will include components of implementation to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=345.6s)]
*  ensure that Hezbollah is not there and most importantly to ensure that the infrastructure [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  is not there and is not allowed to be rebuilt. And so the United States for the first time is [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  going to play a role in the monitoring and the implementation of this agreement in order to give [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=360.72s)]
*  more confidence. And so the last few days were until it was voted on in the cabinet in Israel [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=365.68s)]
*  and agreed to by the Lebanese government. There were a lot of issues that could have come up to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=372.72s)]
*  derail it. And so we were really trying to work this into the very last minute. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  But as I said before, the prime minister of Israel felt this was in the right, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  best interest of Israel and the Lebanese felt the same way, which is why they asked us to try to do [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=386.48s)]
*  a major push to get it. And I'm pleased that we have it and a lot of lives will be saved as a result. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=392.88000000000005s)]
*  It is tough not to look at this and remember the number of lives lost, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  some 3000 Lebanese were killed, dozens of villages were wiped out in this conflict. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=401.68s)]
*  You talked about translating some of the gains, right, into this agreement essentially. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=405.36s)]
*  There is perhaps some cautious hope that maybe this could change things in terms of the situation [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=410.8s)]
*  in Gaza. Do you hold out any hope that this could in fact influence some movement when it comes to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=417.36s)]
*  some sort of a ceasefire and hostage release negotiation for Gaza? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=423.2s)]
*  First of all, being who I am, I always hold hope and I work towards, I believe in reality, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  many people said that breaking the linkage between Lebanon and Gaza was impossible [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=434.4s)]
*  and that we would not be able to reach a ceasefire in Lebanon without one in Gaza. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=438.96s)]
*  And that was proven wrong. So I'm glad we were able to get that due to the perseverance of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=443.35999999999996s)]
*  the president and the effort here. But I do think, Erika, that look, Hamas woke up this morning at [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  4 a.m. and realizing that the idea that they had Hezbollah as supporters of theirs [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=455.2s)]
*  by linking the two conflicts, that that link was broken, that Hezbollah had cut a deal, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=461.52s)]
*  and now they were the only ones, and that they were alone and the cavalry wasn't coming from [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  the north. Moreover, Israel is no longer fighting a two-front war, it is fighting a one-front war. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=470.88s)]
*  And so this is a moment of opportunity and as the president said yesterday, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=476.8s)]
*  we will go out and try to get a ceasefire in Gaza that brings out the hostages, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=481.2s)]
*  including the American ones. So I think we may have a turning point here that we need to explore. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=485.76s)]
*  Real quickly, in terms of that and the president's pledge to continue to try there, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=492.08s)]
*  he said it's going to be different, but we haven't heard a lot of specifics on how it is now [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=496.24s)]
*  different. Is it simply that this is now a one-front war for Israel? Is that the only [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=500.08s)]
*  thing that's changed or is there more? Well, I think that over the last several weeks and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=504.4s)]
*  a couple of months, the entire region has changed. Iran's number one proxy, Hezbollah, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=508.56s)]
*  has been degraded and diminished significantly, and now Hamas is on its own. I think that changes [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=516.0s)]
*  the dynamic. The president also said Hamas at the end of the day did not come to negotiating table [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=523.2s)]
*  for a long time now, in good faith to negotiate. We're hoping that now the Lebanon deal will help [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=528.72s)]
*  us get to a place where we can have a discussion in earnest. And the president is determined to [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=535.6s)]
*  fight to the last minute to try to be able to get a deal that brings the hostages home [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=541.52s)]
*  and provides the region some stability. Amos Haqzein, appreciate you joining us tonight. Thank you. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=546.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqgPV8Lh0zI&t=550.8000000000001s)]
