# AOC doubles down calling the situation in Gaza a genocide
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [March 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4)
*  Joining us now to talk about Trump's deadline in New York tomorrow and much more New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=5.2s)]
*  Congresswoman, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=8.88s)]
*  So five years ago, as a brand new member of the House of Representatives, you grilled [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=10.28s)]
*  Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen about whether Mr. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=16.28s)]
*  Trump had lied about his finances for tax purposes. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=18.96s)]
*  Attorney General of New York Letitia James says that testimony directly led to her office's [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=22.96s)]
*  fraud investigation and this four hundred sixty four million dollar penalty. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=28.32s)]
*  This bond Trump has until tomorrow to post. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=33.08s)]
*  If he does not post that bond, do you think the state of New York and Attorney General [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=36.24s)]
*  James should begin seizing his assets? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=40.84s)]
*  And are you at all concerned that doing so could actually lend him political support [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=43.16s)]
*  feeding into his narrative that the deep state and Democrats are out to get him unfairly? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=48.92s)]
*  Well, you know, I think Attorney General James has been handling this case with tremendous [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=53.64s)]
*  skill. It's ultimately up to her determination, but it is my belief that all people should [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=60.88s)]
*  be treated equally under the law. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=66.68s)]
*  And if that seizure of assets would be pursued to any other American, then Donald Trump [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=68.68s)]
*  should be treated the same. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=75.84s)]
*  As far as the political implications go, I think that what we are dealing with politically [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=77.64s)]
*  is the much larger and much more grave and serious pressure of having this judgment [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  against against Donald Trump and him being in this degree of debt and and the financial [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=90.91999999999999s)]
*  pressures that he is under and what he's what he is subject to do in order to obtain those [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=97.6s)]
*  assets. I actually think that whether I actually think that that there is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=103.6s)]
*  risk in not seizing these assets and and the open window that exists in him trying [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=107.52s)]
*  to secure these funds through other means, we've seen a lot of interesting transactions [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=114.32s)]
*  happening with truth social and other means. And there's a very real risk of political [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  corruption. So again, I respect the attorney general's discretion here, but I do think [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=125.44s)]
*  that he should be treated equally under the law. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=131.88s)]
*  Do you think? Well, let me put it this way. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=134.2s)]
*  What do you say to an independent voter, an average voter who looks at what's going on [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=136.96s)]
*  with Donald Trump? You have his assets might be seized tomorrow. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=141.04s)]
*  You also have the hush money case from the attorney general. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=144.48s)]
*  I'm sorry, the district attorney, Alvin Bragg of New York. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=148.32s)]
*  You also have the Georgia case about election interference. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=151.28s)]
*  You also have the special counsel investigation on election interference. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=154.92s)]
*  You also have the classified documents case down in Florida. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=158.8s)]
*  That's five cases. And to a voter, what do you say to a voter who says, well, that doesn't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=161.72s)]
*  look like he's being treated equally before the law. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=166.24s)]
*  That looks like somebody that the government is going after. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=169.64s)]
*  Has there ever been a president, Republican or Democrat, that has been subject to this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=175.24s)]
*  level of criminal charges, indictments and investigations? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=182.56s)]
*  This is not about party. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=188.68s)]
*  This is not about politics. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=190.48s)]
*  This is about corruption and criminality. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  We're talking about an individual who ordered essentially a terrorist attack on the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=195.12s)]
*  capital of the United States in order to retain power. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=201.56s)]
*  That is not about being a Republican. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=205.28s)]
*  It is not about being a Democrat. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=207.88s)]
*  It's about being an unethical and individual who is subject and prone to criminality. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=210.4s)]
*  And unfortunately, this is the state that we're in. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=218.16s)]
*  And I actually think that the fact that it's happening in so many places and so many [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=223.12s)]
*  jurisdictions cuts in the face of that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=226.96s)]
*  This is not just New York. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=229.12s)]
*  This is Georgia. This is federal courts as well. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=230.52s)]
*  So in the House of Representatives, House Speaker Mike Johnson is facing a real revolt [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=234.04s)]
*  within the Republican conference after passing the government funding bill this week on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=237.76s)]
*  Friday. Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green announced a call to vote to [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=242.48s)]
*  remove him as speaker, a motion to vacate at some point, she says. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=247.2s)]
*  Republicans are about to be down to a single seat majority. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=250.92s)]
*  Some Democrats are saying they're going to vote if the motion to vacate comes up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=254.44s)]
*  They'll vote to keep Speaker Johnson as speaker to avoid avoid additional chaos. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=257.96s)]
*  How would you vote? You know, I think that Democrats who work as a team, I am not [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  inclined to vote for a Speaker Johnson. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=269.08s)]
*  I'm not inclined to vote for an individual who for Speaker who doesn't believe in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=271.40000000000003s)]
*  women's rights, doesn't believe in rights to bodily autonomy, who has supported [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=277.8s)]
*  overturning presidential a presidential election. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=283.48s)]
*  I my vote would most likely be for a Speaker Jeffries, which becomes an [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=286.56s)]
*  increasingly likely reality day after day as Republicans pursue further [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  midterm resignations. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=299.52s)]
*  But, you know, I think for those of us and for any Democrat inclined, I don't think we [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=301.96s)]
*  do that for free. And I don't think that we do that, you know, out of sympathy for [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=308.32s)]
*  Republicans. And I think that, you know, the realities of governance are there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  We want to make sure that that governance continues and that responsible governance [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  continues. And that generally tends to happen under a Democratic majority. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  You gave a very forceful speech on the House floor Friday about the humanitarian [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=329.08s)]
*  crisis in Gaza. You called on President Biden to cut off U.S. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=333.48s)]
*  military aid to Israel. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=337.44s)]
*  I think we have a clip of part of what you said. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's roll that. If you want to know what an unfolding genocide looks like, open [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=342.44s)]
*  your eyes. It looks like the forced famine of one point one million innocents. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=349.44s)]
*  We must write our story in this moment of what it means and who we are as [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=355.92s)]
*  Americans. And our story must be not that we were good men who did nothing. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=362.68s)]
*  Now, clearly not enough aid is getting in. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=370.2s)]
*  Clearly, the conditions for the Palestinian people are horrific and much more needs to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=373.56s)]
*  be done. Genocide is a word that has serious and specific connotations and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=377.71999999999997s)]
*  allegations. It's defined by the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=384.24s)]
*  ethnic, racial or religious group. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=390.52s)]
*  So you just to clarify here, you believe the Israeli military, the Israeli [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=393.0s)]
*  government are actively trying. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=396.6s)]
*  They intend to destroy the Palestinian people and not that what's happening is [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=398.48s)]
*  horrible, but it's happening because Israel is going after the terrorists of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  Hamas who attacked them on October 7th and Hamas embeds within the civilian [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=406.76s)]
*  population. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=410.36s)]
*  Well, Jake, you're absolutely right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=411.36s)]
*  This word is extremely serious. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=415.24s)]
*  It's one that's taken with extraordinary gravity. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=417.12s)]
*  And to me, the threshold of intent is a high one. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  It is a serious one and is not one that is made lightly. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  However, when we look at the precipice of what is happening with a forced famine [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=427.16s)]
*  of one point one million Gazans, where multiple governments, NGOs and even [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=433.6s)]
*  officials within the United States State Department have stated themselves plainly [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=440.24s)]
*  that the Israeli government and leaders in the Israeli government are intentionally [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=445.96s)]
*  denying, blocking and slow walking this aid and are precipitating a mass famine. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  I believe we have crossed the threshold of intent. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=458.24s)]
*  It is horrific. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=462.68s)]
*  I think it is extremely clear and it is extremely important that all people [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=464.48s)]
*  understand the difference between people and their governments, Israelis and the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=470.08000000000004s)]
*  Israeli government, Palestinians from Hamas. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=474.56s)]
*  But what we are seeing here, I think, with with a forced famine is beyond our [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  ability to deny or explain away. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=484.88s)]
*  There is no targeting of Hamas in precipitating a mass famine of a million people, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  half of whom are children. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=492.8s)]
*  So I asked Israeli officials about your speech and they say we are allowing [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=494.52s)]
*  hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza every single day. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=499.88s)]
*  They're trying to increase those numbers. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=502.92s)]
*  They have to inspect the cargo to make sure no weapons are getting in weapons that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=506.12s)]
*  would be used by Hamas against the people of Israel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  They also Israeli officials also argue this war could end tomorrow if Hamas freed [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=513.84s)]
*  the hostages and lay down the arms. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=518.12s)]
*  Do you disagree? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=520.28s)]
*  I do disagree because when we are talking about famine, the actions of Hamas should [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=523.3199999999999s)]
*  not be tied to whether a three year old can eat. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=531.2s)]
*  The actions of Hamas do not justify forcing thousands, hundreds of thousands of [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=534.56s)]
*  people to eat grass as their bodies consume themselves. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=540.28s)]
*  We and the Israeli government has a right to go after Hamas, but we are talking about [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=544.56s)]
*  a population of millions of innocent Palestinians. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=549.56s)]
*  We are talking about collective punishment, which is injustifiable. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=552.36s)]
*  And the the excuses that the Israeli government is giving about what they are and are [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  not allowing simply do not square with what the UK government is stating, with what [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=564.64s)]
*  international aid organizations are stating and even what our own State Department [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szU9lofyoS4&t=569.56s)]
