# Chris Christie on what he thinks is top priority in Israel-Hamas war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE)
*  You met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=0.0s)]
*  What can you tell us about your meeting and what was discussed? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=2.72s)]
*  Well, we discussed the current state of the war. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=7.68s)]
*  We discussed American involvement and support. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  We discussed the situation with the hostages that are being held. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=13.76s)]
*  And we talked about the atrocities here that I've been able to see firsthand [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=18.64s)]
*  during my visit here today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=23.92s)]
*  And you've also been meeting with, as I understand, some survivors [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=25.84s)]
*  and family of those affected as well, right? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=28.96s)]
*  Yeah, I met with I met with two survivors, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=32.88s)]
*  one young woman, 23 years old, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=36.88s)]
*  shot in a bomb shelter who survived only because she was covered by other dead bodies. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=39.6s)]
*  Yeah, I met with two families of hostages today. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=45.68s)]
*  I have this dog tag for that 19 year old young man [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=50.8s)]
*  who I whose family I met with tonight. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  His his father has spent time in New Jersey, lived in New Jersey for a long time. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=57.32s)]
*  And, you know, those folks are suffering. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=63.32s)]
*  They've been suffering now for 37 days, not knowing if their loved ones are alive or dead, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=66.88s)]
*  not knowing if they're being cared for. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=72.08s)]
*  It's a it's an extraordinary situation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=74.52s)]
*  Yeah, we just we just spoke to a brother of someone or someone who has a brother [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=76.92s)]
*  that is currently being held hostage. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  And he talked about how difficult it has been up to this point. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=82.96s)]
*  Now, look, we are in the middle of this conflict in the fighting right now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=87.24s)]
*  But today on CNN, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=91.0s)]
*  as far as solutions for post fighting, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=95.08s)]
*  pushed back on the idea of the Palestinian Authority running Gaza [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  and said any solution would need to have an overriding and overreaching [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=100.8s)]
*  Israeli military envelope. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=103.88s)]
*  Do you agree with Prime Minister Netanyahu's assessment there? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, what do you what do you propose or think is going to happen here? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=108.8s)]
*  I think it's too early to make that determination, Omar. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=113.52s)]
*  I understand that the prime minister is focused exclusively now on the war, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=116.56s)]
*  on degrading Hamas's ability to ever do this again, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=121.64s)]
*  protecting the territorial integrity and the safety and security [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=125.24s)]
*  of the people of Israel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  But look, I don't see any long line of folks looking to volunteer [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=131.4s)]
*  to take over Gaza from Hamas. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=135.0s)]
*  This is, I think, going to be a diplomatic solution [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  that's going to need to be come to by all the interested parties [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=139.32s)]
*  at a time when the war is finally concluded. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=143.8s)]
*  But first and foremost, you have to protect the safety and security [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=146.48s)]
*  of the people of Israel and you have to degrade Hamas because Hamas [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=150.72s)]
*  and believe me, I spent today spending 40 minutes watching a video [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=154.36s)]
*  of the atrocities that were committed [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=160.48s)]
*  by Hamas that day. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=164.16s)]
*  And I will tell you what struck me the most, Omar. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=166.12s)]
*  It wasn't just the inhumanity of what they were doing, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=168.52s)]
*  chopping off heads, burning people alive. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  But it was the joy they took in it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=176.12s)]
*  They had video of one terrorist calling his mother [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  saying, your your son killed 10 Jews with his own hands. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=184.08s)]
*  Your son's a hero. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=188.12s)]
*  As long as there are folks like that in Hamas [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  who are focused on wiping Israel off the map and killing the Jewish people, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=194.04s)]
*  discussion of what happens in Gaza after the war has to take a back seat [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=199.76s)]
*  at the moment to eliminating Hamas's ability to threaten the lives [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=204.64s)]
*  of the people of Israel again. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, the prime minister will have a lot of time to think about [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=211.27999999999997s)]
*  the postwar period when it comes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  But I think right now, task one is making sure that Hamas's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  capabilities degraded and protecting the safety and security of the Israeli people. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=222.92s)]
*  And that's among one of the multiple dynamics going on right now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  Of course, there's a military campaign to to weed out and eliminate Hamas [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  on the side of the IDF, but also trying to rescue some of these hostages. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=234.04s)]
*  I want to go back to a little bit after October 70. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  You said a little less than two weeks after the October 7th attack. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=242.2s)]
*  You said providing aid to civilians in Gaza was a very, very low priority [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  and that the focus at that point needed to be on militarily and financially helping Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=250.0s)]
*  Obviously, since then, we've seen a level of civilians killed by the thousands up to this point. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=255.08s)]
*  Do you still believe humanitarian aid is a low priority in comparison [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=259.92s)]
*  to the Israeli military's needs? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=263.8s)]
*  I still believe that, yes, I think if you're prioritizing those things, Omar, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=267.56s)]
*  the most important thing is for us to provide financial assistance and military [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=272.08s)]
*  hardware to the Israelis so they can do what they need to do in Gaza [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=277.04s)]
*  regarding the terrorists who attacked them and killed over 1200 of their civilians. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=281.8s)]
*  Now, no one likes civilian death of anyone, whether it's Israeli or Palestinian. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=286.24s)]
*  But let's remember this two things. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=293.0s)]
*  First, there was a ceasefire on October 6th, Omar, and it was Hamas that broke [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=295.24s)]
*  that ceasefire with their attacks on October 7th. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=300.04s)]
*  And secondly, Israel has done much to try to get Palestinians moved from the area [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=304.08s)]
*  where the battling is going to be to the southern part of Gaza. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=310.88s)]
*  It is Hamas that is refusing to let many of those people go to the southern part of Gaza [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=313.88s)]
*  because they want to use them as human shields. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=319.72s)]
*  I believe that Hamas cares less about Palestinian civilian life than Israel does. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=322.44s)]
*  And so, you know, Hamas has to take responsibility for this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=329.04s)]
*  They could be helping their civilians significantly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=332.84s)]
*  And we saw a report just today that Israel sent fuel to run the Al-Shifa hospital [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=334.64s)]
*  and that Hamas refused to accept it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  You can't complain about not being able to run the incubators and the life support [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=345.0s)]
*  systems in a hospital and then turn down fuel that's being sent by the Israelis [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=348.91999999999996s)]
*  to be able to work those those pieces of equipment. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=354.52s)]
*  So Hamas is the hypocrite here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=358.0s)]
*  And that's why I think the top priority has to be aiding Israel [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=360.64s)]
*  so that we can put an end to this as quickly as possible. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=364.28s)]
*  And this this topic was posed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he was on our air [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=366.8s)]
*  a little bit earlier today on the topic of whether they've been doing enough to protect [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  some of the civilians that have been killed or at least minimize the civilians that were killed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=376.88s)]
*  Take a listen to what he told Dan Abash. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=380.32s)]
*  We're trying to minimize civilian casualties as a result of our ground action. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=384.6s)]
*  I think the number of civilian casualties is actually being reduced because people are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=388.64s)]
*  heeding our calls to leave the area and defying Hamas's attempt to keep them there. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=393.16s)]
*  And we'll do everything in our power to do that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=398.76s)]
*  Even with that, Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said far too many Palestinians [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=401.48s)]
*  have been killed. Do you agree with the Secretary of State there? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=406.28s)]
*  Look, I think that any loss of civilian life is tragic and should be avoided at all [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=411.36s)]
*  costs. But, Omar, we need to make sure that Hamas cannot use these civilians as a [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=417.44s)]
*  shield to prevent them from having their military capability degraded. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=424.84s)]
*  They've shown on October 7th and the days afterwards that they will use missiles. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=429.84s)]
*  They will come by air, sea and land in an attempt to kill Israeli citizens. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=434.92s)]
*  And we can't permit that to continue to happen, Omar. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=442.56s)]
*  So, you know, this is this is always very, very difficult. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  But I do believe that Israel is trying to do everything it can to avoid the loss of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=448.88s)]
*  civilian life, both in Gaza and in Israel. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=454.12s)]
*  Now, here in the U.S., obviously, there's a budget fight that's really just beginning as we [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=458.56s)]
*  head towards a government shutdown. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=463.0s)]
*  But as far as the plan that was released, the bills don't provide any funding for Israel or [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine, which you've also visited over the course of this past year. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  What message do you believe, again, not the final version, but still, what message do you [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=473.16s)]
*  believe that these initial versions sends to our foreign allies? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=477.8s)]
*  Not a good one, Omar. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=484.44s)]
*  And I think that candidly, we have to continue to play the role in the world we've always [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=485.84s)]
*  played, because if we don't, the evil force will fill in our vacuum that we leave. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=490.8s)]
*  And I mean China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=497.4s)]
*  And let me tell you, when I went to a military institution today, installation here today, I [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=500.76s)]
*  saw weapons that were from North Korea, weapons that were from Iran and weapons that were from [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=506.2s)]
*  Russia. If leaders in Congress don't understand that all of these things are connected and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=512.36s)]
*  that American dismissal of our role in any of these instances occur, encourages more of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=520.72s)]
*  them, not fewer of them. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=528.1999999999999s)]
*  We need to send a very clear message by supporting Israel and supporting Ukraine. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=530.24s)]
*  And believe me, Vladimir Putin is happy about what's going on here in Israel and in [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h7Raw-KFZE&t=536.0799999999999s)]
