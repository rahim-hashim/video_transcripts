# Bolton says ICC actions show it’s not ‘tethered to rule of law itself’
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA)
*  Tonight, President Biden is openly rebuking the International Criminal Court prosecutor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=0.0s)]
*  for seeking an arrest warrant against both Hamas' and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=5.76s)]
*  Netanyahu for what they say are war crimes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=15.08s)]
*  We reject the ICC's application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=18.72s)]
*  One of these warrants may imply there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=25.96s)]
*  Contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  happening is not genocide. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=34.32s)]
*  We reject that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  That is a notable comment from President Biden there, flatly rejecting accusations that there's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=40.28s)]
*  a genocide underway in Gaza. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  I should note those accusations which have been made in the International Court of Justice [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  are separate from today's actions in the International Criminal Court, which seeks to hold individual [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=52.0s)]
*  Hamas and Israeli leaders both accountable. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=57.32s)]
*  The ICC Chief Prosecutor Kareem Khan convened a group of legal experts that also included [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=60.68s)]
*  the human rights attorney Amal Clooney to advise on these warrants. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=65.88s)]
*  He defended this in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=70.32s)]
*  Nobody is above the law. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=77.0s)]
*  No people Biden to birth or passport, religion, nationality or the color of their skin have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=78.24s)]
*  a get out of jail free card, have a free pass to say well the law doesn't apply to us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=84.52s)]
*  Every human life, every baby that is killed, whether it's a baby that's cruelly abducted [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=89.9s)]
*  by Hamas and killed or a baby that's been bombed or killed or has died in incubators [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=94.9s)]
*  because of no electricity or water or food in Gaza, for them, for their families and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=102.0s)]
*  humanity it's a tragedy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=107.72s)]
*  And this is why we have a court. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=110.4s)]
*  It's about the equal application of the law. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Here tonight to discuss John Bolton, the former National Security Advisor under former President [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=115.88s)]
*  Donald Trump, also the former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=120.32s)]
*  And Ambassador Bolton, first let me get your reaction to what we heard from President Biden. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=123.88s)]
*  He had a pretty blunt rebuke of what we just heard there from the Chief Prosecutor at the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=128.6s)]
*  ICC and this idea that they are going to seek these warrants for both the leaders of Hamas [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=133.72s)]
*  but also the Israeli Prime Minister and the Defense Minister. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=138.68s)]
*  Well Biden is half right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=144.8s)]
*  What's really illegitimate here is the International Criminal Court itself. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  It's a fantasy. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=150.98000000000002s)]
*  It's a piece of government, not a whole government, a piece of government floating around in the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=151.98000000000002s)]
*  international ether, unchecked by executive or legislative power, utterly unable to enforce [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=157.28s)]
*  its judgments and acting in a way that's predictably irresponsible. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=164.36s)]
*  For many years people have referred to Israel as the canary in the coal mine on behalf of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=169.16s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=174.52s)]
*  This is another example because what this rogue prosecutor, this utterly unaccountable [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  court is doing here against Israel, they're going to do against us soon enough. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=180.72s)]
*  Well so what do you mean that President Biden is half right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=186.0s)]
*  He's basically agreeing with you that both of you agree it's wrong to say that you're [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=189.32s)]
*  going to go after the leaders of Hamas and also the Israeli leaders and kind of create [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=194.64s)]
*  this equivalence between the two of them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=198.76s)]
*  No I'm saying it's wrong to go after any, this court is not the body to prosecute anybody. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=202.2s)]
*  The court has also indicted Vladimir Putin in connection with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=207.88s)]
*  That's the wrong way to do it too. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=214.12s)]
*  You can't, the charge of moral equivalence gives legitimacy to the court in effect if [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=215.56s)]
*  they indict really bad guys there in favor of it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=222.2s)]
*  The fact is it's the court itself that's fundamentally flawed. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=225.4s)]
*  The example is right here in this case. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=230.08s)]
*  This unaccountable prosecutor is interfering right in the middle of active conflict. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=232.52s)]
*  Now in a real government with real power, in our case the president has both the war [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=238.6s)]
*  power and the prosecution power and sometimes has to make a trade off. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  This utterly unaccountable prosecutor didn't make any trade off at all and I think people [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=248.12s)]
*  should ask does this now make settling the conflict in the Middle East easier or harder? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=252.88s)]
*  It won't matter to the prosecutor because he'll never be held responsible for it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=259.46s)]
*  And obviously you mentioned Putin there and he's not really traveling a lot maybe to China [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=264.04s)]
*  or something but what does this move mean? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=268.56s)]
*  If they do get the judges to sign off on these warrants and we don't know that they will [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=271.64s)]
*  but if they do and they're executed, what does that mean for Israel's allies who are [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=275.32s)]
*  parties to this court and they're technically supposed to arrest them if they travel and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=281.64s)]
*  they have an ICC warrant? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=288.0s)]
*  Well it should be a wake up call to them that they've stepped into a very dangerous territory [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=291.96s)]
*  here and I think this is the sort of thing that US officials need to worry about in particular. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=297.96s)]
*  The one silver lining in this cloud, when you look at the self-righteous grandstanding [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=305.96s)]
*  publicity seeking prosecutor there, I think this is the ICC digging its grave in this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=312.32s)]
*  country. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=318.28s)]
*  I think I would be happy to predict right here, I don't think the US is going to join [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=319.28s)]
*  the ICC within the lifespan of anybody watching this program because the targets of this prosecutor [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=324.28s)]
*  are fundamentally irrational. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=332.55999999999995s)]
*  To proceed against a free, law-abiding, democratic society in the way that it did shows it's [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  not tethered to a rule of law itself. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=342.71999999999997s)]
*  But Ambassador, when you look at this, there is growing criticism of how Israel has conducted [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  this war. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you believe that Israel has upheld international law since October 7th? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=352.54s)]
*  I haven't heard legitimate charges that it hasn't and I think there's been a lot of high [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=358.66s)]
*  propaganda. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=363.5s)]
*  One very important point just to prove that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=364.5s)]
*  There's a lot of dead civilians. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=367.1s)]
*  The United Nations. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=368.1s)]
*  A lot of dead Palestinians. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=369.1s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=371.1s)]
*  The United Nations just cut in half the number of women and children it reports killed in [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  the Gaza conflict. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  Now this is the United Nations accepting now the figures of the Hamas Ministry of Health [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=382.46s)]
*  as opposed to the Hamas Information Office. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=388.73999999999995s)]
*  But the fact is that the total number of casualties and the number particularly of women and children [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=392.44s)]
*  killed has been out of whack. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=397.41999999999996s)]
*  The UN by its shift concedes that numbers that have been used on women and children [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=399.94s)]
*  have been double what even another part of Hamas says. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=407.38s)]
*  I think this is a media problem too if I may say so. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=412.22s)]
*  These numbers have come from Hamas entities right from the start of this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=415.94000000000005s)]
*  And normally what media outlets do when they're given a fact like that, they think it's important [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=420.86s)]
*  enough to report, that's fine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  They then go on to say we have not been able to verify this independently. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=426.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, Ambassador, we- [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=431.02000000000004s)]
*  Is there any media outlet in the country that has verified those numbers? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=432.02000000000004s)]
*  We have been deeply skeptical of the numbers because they don't let free and independent [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=436.46000000000004s)]
*  journalists go and see it and has tried on multiple occasions. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=440.82s)]
*  But even if you are skeptical of that figure, as we've seen even President Biden express [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=444.05999999999995s)]
*  skepticism, we do know that a lot of women and children and Palestinian civilians have [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=449.53999999999996s)]
*  been killed. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=454.61999999999995s)]
*  Have they been colluding with Hamas? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=457.41999999999996s)]
*  Do you have any information on that? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=458.73999999999995s)]
*  Palestinian babies? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=462.14s)]
*  Can women collude with Hamas? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=463.21999999999997s)]
*  Can women collude with Hamas? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=464.94s)]
*  Four-year-olds, little children that we're seeing, Ambassador, who were in hospital. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=465.94s)]
*  We talked to the doctors. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  16- [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=470.66s)]
*  16, 17-year-olds? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=471.22s)]
*  I'm talking about four-year-olds and five-year-olds. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=472.22s)]
*  Let's take that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=477.22s)]
*  Fine. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=478.22s)]
*  Let's take that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=479.22s)]
*  The question in conflict, in urban conflict, which the United States itself has faced as [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=480.22s)]
*  recently as Iraq with Fallujah and Mosul, is, is Israel targeting legitimate military targets, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=486.22s)]
*  A, and B, has it taken into account the proportional collateral effects if it goes after those [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=493.22s)]
*  targets? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=499.22s)]
*  There's no prohibition about civilian casualties. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=500.22s)]
*  Otherwise, you wouldn't have urban conflict. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=503.22s)]
*  And the studies that were done of American action in Fallujah and Mosul and other places [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=505.22s)]
*  in Iraq and Afghanistan have shown ratios of civilian to military casualties in the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=511.22s)]
*  range of five to one. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=517.22s)]
*  In Gaza, by Hamas's own statistics, the range is two to one. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=519.22s)]
*  So I just think it's important to understand that when Hamas cynically, barbarically uses [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=524.22s)]
*  its own population as human shields, the morally culpable party here is Hamas. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=531.22s)]
*  And no one is defending Hamas. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvFuNNVwnA&t=537.22s)]
