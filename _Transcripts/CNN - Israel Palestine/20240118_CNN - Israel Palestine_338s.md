# CNN witnessed first-hand results of Israel's bulldozing of graveyards in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE)
*  Today, the Israeli military acknowledged that they rolled into a cemetery, took bodies out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=0.0s)]
*  of graves as part of what they say is a search for Israeli hostages remains. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=4.28s)]
*  But as the Israeli military put out that statement, we were completing our investigation into [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=8.9s)]
*  the Israeli military's desecration of cemeteries. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=13.32s)]
*  And what we found is 16 cemeteries across Gaza damaged or destroyed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  I do want to warn our viewers that they may find some of these images disturbing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=20.68s)]
*  In Gaza, even the dead cannot escape the indignities of war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=28.26s)]
*  More than a dozen cemeteries, like this one in Jabalia, desecrated by the Israeli military. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=35.06s)]
*  Gravestones destroyed, soil upturned, trademarks leaving little left for the living to honor [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=41.980000000000004s)]
*  their dead. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  This is that same graveyard before the war. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=50.3s)]
*  One month later, a series of trademarks can be seen on the northwestern edge. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  It is no exception. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=59.22s)]
*  A CNN analysis of videos and satellite imagery found that 16 cemeteries have been damaged [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=61.059999999999995s)]
*  or destroyed by the Israeli military since it launched its ground offensive. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=67.5s)]
*  As Israeli forces pushed deeper into Gaza, they crushed the graves of thousands of Palestinians [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=73.16s)]
*  between November and January. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=79.4s)]
*  Janina Dill, co-director of Oxford University's Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=81.82s)]
*  says destroying graveyards violates international law, except under very limited circumstances. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=87.74s)]
*  Cemeteries are not military objectives. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=95.33999999999999s)]
*  They are in fact what international law would consider an object that is normally dedicated [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  to civilian purposes, like places of worship generally. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  So this is protected from intentional attack. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=105.22s)]
*  It can only be intentionally attacked or destroyed if it becomes a military objective. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=107.42s)]
*  In some cases, like this cemetery in the Shezaiye refugee camp, Israeli bulldozers [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=112.18s)]
*  turned cemeteries into military outposts, parking armored vehicles behind freshly raised berms. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=117.66000000000001s)]
*  The damage is often deliberate and progressive. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=125.94s)]
*  Over two weeks in December, the military bulldozed more and more of this cemetery east of Khan [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  building defensive fortifications. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=136.26000000000002s)]
*  CNN witnessed firsthand the results of Israel's bulldozing of graveyards while embedded with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=140.06s)]
*  Israeli forces last week. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=145.58s)]
*  The armored personnel carrier CNN was traveling in drove right through this cemetery in Al-Berej, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  on a freshly bulldozed dirt road. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=154.62s)]
*  And then there's this. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=158.18s)]
*  Tombs opened at a cemetery in Khan Yunis this week. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=160.18s)]
*  Bodies removed from their graves. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=164.26s)]
*  In a statement, the Israeli military acknowledged exhuming bodies from the cemetery as part [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  of its search for the bodies of Israeli hostages. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  An IDF spokesman could not account for the damage to the 16 cemeteries identified by [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=175.26s)]
*  CNN but said that in some cases there is no other choice, providing this photo of what [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=180.1s)]
*  it says is a Hamas rocket launcher at a cemetery in Gaza. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=185.66s)]
*  CNN could not independently verify where it was taken. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=189.7s)]
*  The spokesman could not account for the military posts over graveyards but said we have a serious [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=193.58s)]
*  obligation to the respect of the dead and there is no policy to create military posts [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=198.5s)]
*  out of graveyards. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=203.58s)]
*  In at least one case, the Israeli military appears to have taken pains to maneuver around [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=206.38000000000002s)]
*  a graveyard. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  The Deir el-Balahur cemetery, which holds the remains of many Christian and Jewish soldiers [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=213.02s)]
*  from World War I, left intact despite devastation all around. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=218.02s)]
*  At the Al-Tufa cemetery, a very different picture. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=224.3s)]
*  Residents say bodies were uprooted by Israeli bulldozers. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=228.3s)]
*  We are currently retrieving the corpses of the martyrs that are present in the cemetery. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=232.5s)]
*  The occupation forces have run over most of them with their bulldozers and we have only [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  identified a small number of corpses and martyrs. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  As for the rest, their identities remain unknown. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=246.34s)]
*  South Africa cited Israel's destruction of cemeteries as part of its case, arguing Israel [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=250.54s)]
*  is committing genocide in Gaza. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=256.22s)]
*  Israel denies the allegation but experts say cemetery destruction could be evidence of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=258.9s)]
*  Israel's intent. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=264.02s)]
*  There is huge symbolic meaning to the notion that not even the dead are left in peace. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=265.58s)]
*  It suggests that disrespect towards the kind of spiritual life of your enemy, their cultural [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=271.1s)]
*  property and heritage, is evidence of an animus against your enemy that is unhelpful [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=276.46s)]
*  in this context. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=282.18s)]
*  The Israeli military is still desecrating graves in Gaza. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=283.82s)]
*  At the Hanunah cemetery where the military dug up bodies this week, the damage is extensive [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=291.9s)]
*  and all too familiar. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=297.79999999999995s)]
*  Tumors destroyed, shrouded bodies sticking out of the soil, the dead roused from their [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=301.58s)]
*  final rest. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=308.06s)]
*  And the Israeli military pointed to Hamas using some of these cemeteries for military [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=312.29999999999995s)]
*  purposes to justify what we've documented here. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  But what we're talking about isn't just strikes on these cemeteries. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=320.29999999999995s)]
*  In some cases, it's the bulldozing of entire cemeteries, putting military outposts there, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=323.46s)]
*  heavy armored vehicles driving right through the graves, showing very little care for [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=328.22s)]
*  the dignity of the dead. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=332.78000000000003s)]
*  It speaks to something far more systematic than what the military acknowledged. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFEkxvAhiE&t=334.18s)]
