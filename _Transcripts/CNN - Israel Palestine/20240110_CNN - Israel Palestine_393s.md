# See inside tunnels IDF alleges Hamas used under Khan Younis
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY)
*  As we're very clear here, sure to be a topic tonight in the debate is Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=0.0s)]
*  How much support the United States is willing to give Israel specifically and how conditional [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=5.32s)]
*  is that support? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=9.76s)]
*  So much of that war tonight is still being waged below ground. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  And now, and it is important right ahead of this debate, CNN has gotten incredible access [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=13.76s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=17.8s)]
*  Going deep inside captured Hamas tunnels. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=19.28s)]
*  In fact, the first Western television crew allowed to go inside Khan Yunus was our Nick [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=21.6s)]
*  And he got a rare look at where hostages were held underground. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=27.24s)]
*  And as part of this access, which did come from the IDF, it is important that you know [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=29.84s)]
*  that CNN did agree to a report from Gaza under IDF escort at all times. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=34.08s)]
*  As a condition for journalists to join the embed with the IDF, media outlets must submit [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=38.96s)]
*  footage filmed in Gaza to the IDF for security review. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=42.32s)]
*  Now, CNN did not submit its final report to the IDF and retained editorial control. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  But we want to be very transparent with you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=50.8s)]
*  Nick Robertson is out front with this incredible report that you will see first out front. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=53.64s)]
*  Han Yunus, a gunner's view, driving in scouring the landscape for threats. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Problem for these IDF troops, their enemy is mostly hiding in tunnels, they say. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=68.2s)]
*  The biggest issue is the fact that we're actually maneuvering above ground, underground. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=73.88s)]
*  Goldfuss, who commands Israel's biggest military division ever, is adapting. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=80.36s)]
*  So you use all your sensors that you have. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=85.8s)]
*  You use your vision sensor, you use your feel sensor, your smell sensor. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=88.36s)]
*  He has invited CNN to go deep into the tunnels. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=93.24s)]
*  We are told this is the heart of Han Yunus and that hostages are likely underground nearby [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=99.64s)]
*  and that some were held here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=106.52s)]
*  This tunnel we're going in here is one where some of the hostages were held. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=110.08s)]
*  That first round of hostage releases, some of them came out from down here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=116.76s)]
*  So how deep does this tunnel go? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=121.88s)]
*  Our first time to get up close to what's shaping this war. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=124.04s)]
*  We are moving underground, we're maneuvering underground, we're going to reach every, each [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=128.84s)]
*  and every militant or each and every terrorist underground. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=133.0s)]
*  No modern army has had to fight above ground and underground like this before. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=137.6s)]
*  How is that to do it? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=142.16s)]
*  It's difficult and it's just going to be a very, very hard, long fight. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=144.24s)]
*  To see just how hard he takes us deeper. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=149.84s)]
*  So we came down a metal ladder, we've come down one flight of stairs, we're going down [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=153.76s)]
*  a second flight of stairs here, a double flight it looks like. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=158.28s)]
*  And down here, command and control wires running all the way down. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=162.28s)]
*  This is a deep, deep system. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=167.4s)]
*  How deep are we underground do you think right now? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=169.6s)]
*  At the moment we're more or less between 10 to 15 meters underground. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=171.96s)]
*  10 to 15 meters. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=175.96s)]
*  And now we're going down another level. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=176.96s)]
*  Down more steps. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  We're about to go down again another level. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=181.96s)]
*  It's so low my head keeps banging off the roof. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=188.88s)]
*  What are we looking at here? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=192.4s)]
*  This is a small room. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=194.72s)]
*  With some kind of air ventilation system. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=197.56s)]
*  Yeah, air ventilation system that goes up and building. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=198.88s)]
*  Metal frame around the door. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=201.56s)]
*  These metal frames. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=202.76s)]
*  This can be as much as this is a small room, this is how the different cages that they [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=204.56s)]
*  put the kidnapped. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=212.76s)]
*  So they were held in cages. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=214.56s)]
*  In cages, yeah. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=215.56s)]
*  Hidden and utterly cut off. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=217.56s)]
*  And down here you really can't hear anything. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=220.20000000000002s)]
*  What's going on in the outside world? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=223.4s)]
*  Now we must be 20 or 30 meters down? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=227.12s)]
*  We're almost 20. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=229.56s)]
*  Almost 20? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=231.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=232.52s)]
*  So they have tunnels three times as deep as this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=233.52s)]
*  What's clear here, the money, planning and preparation invested for a long siege. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  We're 20 meters underground here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=246.4s)]
*  20 meters and there's a fully flush toilet and it's even painted. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=248.52s)]
*  There's a place for a light bulb and light switches. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  Tiled. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  The labyrinth keeps going. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, now it's so low we're getting down on our knees to get through. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=263.08s)]
*  Goldfuss pauses, lays out his path to victory. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=268.6s)]
*  It's Hamas. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=273.88s)]
*  And we have to reach this Hamas core to finish them off. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=276.08s)]
*  But those Palestinian people above ground are also dying still. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=284.6s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=288.52s)]
*  I understand. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=289.52s)]
*  That's why we're trying to do it as fast as we can. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=290.52s)]
*  Yesterday, there were mortars and rockets fired from north of Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=292.72s)]
*  To the civilian part of Israel. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  So as long as those rockets are coming out and northern Gaza, the people of the south [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=302.0s)]
*  who have moved to the south can't go back to the north. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=305.4s)]
*  As long as we haven't carried out our mission all the way, as long as we haven't finished [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=307.44s)]
*  this mission, I don't think we'll leave here. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=311.64s)]
*  We head back, half an hour underground. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=316.0s)]
*  We've seen only a fraction of this war-changing labyrinth. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=318.96s)]
*  Goldfuss's challenge, find all the others. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=323.64s)]
*  Nick, 65 feet underground where you are, just to even comprehend that, your head hitting [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=330.56s)]
*  the ceiling, I mean it's amazing you were even able to withstand that, to experience [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=336.76s)]
*  that yourself. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=340.32s)]
*  But when you're down there, how is it that the IDF says or knows that they're so close [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=341.96s)]
*  to Hamas hostages in those tunnels or tunnels next to them and yet isn't able to get them out? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=347.68s)]
*  And that's the difficult thing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=356.56s)]
*  How do you fight the battle when you're fighting it in several dimensions? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=358.48s)]
*  I said to him, normally in a battle you would outflank your enemy, you'd get around the [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=362.6s)]
*  side of them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=366.48s)]
*  But down there, he said, we don't even know, we can be standing on top of them, they can [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=367.52s)]
*  be underneath us. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=372.48s)]
*  So we've got to try to fight in all these different dimensions. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=373.64s)]
*  But they do have good intelligence, that's part of the picture. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=377.6s)]
*  And in that tunnel at least, they were able to extract DNA evidence, blood, hair, of the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=381.56s)]
*  hostages that had actually been held down there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=388.36s)]
*  So there's a lot of technical equipment used as well. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0jZLZa-UQY&t=390.2s)]
