# Hostilities escalate between Israel and Hezbollah
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [March 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic)
*  Israel's defense minister, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=0.0s)]
*  Yoav Galant, says his country [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=2.44s)]
*  is closer to making critical [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=6.2s)]
*  decisions about military [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=8.68s)]
*  activities in Lebanon amid [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=10.44s)]
*  escalating tensions between [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=12.68s)]
*  Hezbollah and Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=14.72s)]
*  Now, Mr. Galant made the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=16.68s)]
*  comments to U.S. special envoy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=17.92s)]
*  Amos Hoekstein on Tuesday, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=20.72s)]
*  according to a readout. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=22.92s)]
*  It comes a day after Hoekstein [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=24.0s)]
*  made these comments in Beirut, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=26.64s)]
*  as he met with senior Lebanese [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=29.48s)]
*  officials to try and find [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  a diplomatic de-escalation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=34.96s)]
*  There is no such thing as a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  limited war. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=41.0s)]
*  Escalation will not help the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=42.68s)]
*  Lebanese and Israeli people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=44.32s)]
*  return home. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Escalation will not resolve [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  this crisis. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=49.72s)]
*  And escalation will certainly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=51.16s)]
*  not help Lebanon rebuild [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=52.92s)]
*  and advance forward at this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  critical time in Lebanon's [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=57.72s)]
*  history. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=59.92s)]
*  But a temporary ceasefire is [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=61.28s)]
*  not enough. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=63.04s)]
*  A limited war is not [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=64.48s)]
*  containable. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=66.56s)]
*  Officials say the U.S. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=69.52s)]
*  administration is concerned [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=71.08s)]
*  that Israel is planning a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=73.56s)]
*  ground incursion into Lebanon [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=75.48s)]
*  that could be launched in the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=78.52s)]
*  late spring or early summer [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=79.84s)]
*  if diplomatic efforts fail. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=82.16s)]
*  CNN's Paula Hancocks joins me [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=85.88000000000001s)]
*  now live. Paula, what do you [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=88.72s)]
*  have? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=90.28s)]
*  Well, Becky, the facts that the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  U.S. special envoy was in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=95.72s)]
*  Israel today, Tuesday he was in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=97.4s)]
*  Beirut on Monday, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  really trying to talk both [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=101.2s)]
*  countries back from the ledge, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=103.04s)]
*  pointing out how difficult it [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=104.64s)]
*  would be to try and contain [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  any kind of what he called, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=108.92s)]
*  quote, limited war [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=110.36s)]
*  between the two. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=112.36s)]
*  And the U.S. certainly is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=113.36s)]
*  concerned that the diplomatic [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=114.72s)]
*  solution may not be enough. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=117.12s)]
*  The voice of a child narrating [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=126.88s)]
*  the sounds of conflict. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=129.04s)]
*  Israel's Iron Dome blocking [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=132.44s)]
*  another barrage of Hezbollah [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=134.0s)]
*  rockets. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=135.52s)]
*  Billows of black smoke have [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=138.0s)]
*  become an almost permanent [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=139.36s)]
*  fixture on the horizon of the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=140.56s)]
*  Israeli-Lebanon border. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=142.12s)]
*  Near daily exchanges of fire, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=145.72s)]
*  Israeli strikes pound parts of [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=147.72s)]
*  southern Lebanon villages. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=149.48s)]
*  Homes have been reduced to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=150.96s)]
*  rubble, buildings burned to the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=152.2s)]
*  ground. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=153.84s)]
*  And tens of thousands of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=156.64s)]
*  Israelis remain evacuated from [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=157.8s)]
*  the border out of reach of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=159.48s)]

*  even if there's a temporary [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=193.44s)]

*  For the past few months, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=206.72s)]
*  strikes have focused fairly [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=208.08s)]
*  close to the border region. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  However, Israel is now edging [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=211.44s)]

*  greater Israeli force is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=236.92s)]
*  inevitable if diplomacy fails, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  which he suspects it will. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=240.92s)]
*  If we want to make [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=242.92s)]

*  way to do it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=248.92s)]
*  Sadly, I'm saying it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=250.92s)]
*  I don't think that it's good [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=252.92s)]
*  for us or even for the Lebanese. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=254.92s)]
*  It will be ugly. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=256.92s)]
*  It will be painful for both sides. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=257.92s)]
*  It won't be short. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=260.92s)]
*  A bloody war between Israel and [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=264.92s)]
*  Hezbollah in 2006 is still fresh [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=266.92s)]
*  in the region's memory. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=268.92s)]
*  With concerns, a repeat would be [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=270.92s)]
*  even more deadly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=272.92s)]
*  This is Hezbollah 2.0. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=273.92s)]
*  We don't know what Hezbollah [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=275.92s)]
*  is capable of today. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=277.92s)]
*  No one. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=278.92s)]
*  This is a very secretive [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=279.92s)]
*  organization. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=280.92s)]
*  And we can already see it has [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=281.92s)]
*  way more sophisticated anti-tank [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=283.92s)]
*  weapons, like the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=285.92s)]
*  anti-aircraft guns, and much [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=287.92s)]
*  more sophisticated drones. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=289.92s)]
*  Saad says that while Hezbollah [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=291.92s)]
*  may be war-averse, it is not [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=293.92s)]

*  Nearly 200 have been killed in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=305.92s)]
*  Lebanon since October. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=307.92s)]

*  on the Lebanese side of the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=311.92s)]

*  extremely important story. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=321.92s)]
*  Paula, thank you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=323.92s)]
*  Well, the UN's main agency in [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=325.92s)]
*  Gaza, UNWA, is accusing Israel [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=327.92s)]
*  of detaining and mistreating [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=329.92s)]
*  its staff members. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=331.92s)]
*  The agency's spokesperson said [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=333.92s)]
*  on Monday that staffers have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=335.92s)]
*  been coerced by Israeli forces [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=337.92s)]
*  into giving, and I quote them [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=339.92s)]
*  here, false confessions about [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=341.92s)]

*  spreading misinformation as part [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=349.92s)]

*  agency. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=353.92s)]
*  Well, meantime, its chief, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=355.92s)]
*  Philippe Lazareini, says his [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=357.92s)]
*  organization is facing a [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=359.92s)]
*  financial crisis. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=361.92s)]
*  The UN says 16 nations [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=363.92s)]
*  paused funding to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=365.92s)]
*  UNWA after Israel [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=367.92s)]
*  made allegations that some of its [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=369.92s)]
*  staff was involved [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=371.92s)]
*  in the October 7 attacks. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=373.92s)]
*  Now, those donations total about [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=375.92s)]
*  $450 million. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=377.92s)]
*  Well, getting more [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=379.92s)]
*  aid into Gaza, according to the State [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=381.92s)]
*  Department, is at the top of the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=383.92s)]

*  not nearly enough aid is [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=393.92s)]
*  getting to the besieged [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=395.92s)]
*  enclave. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=397.92s)]
*  We continue to push for a temporary [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=399.92s)]
*  ceasefire through a hostage agreement [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=401.92s)]
*  that would allow a massive surge of aid [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=403.92s)]
*  into Gaza and ease the distribution [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=405.92s)]
*  problems that are currently hindering humanitarian [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=407.92s)]
*  efforts. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=409.92s)]
*  Now, let's be clear. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=411.92s)]
*  What goes in and out of Gaza [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=413.92s)]
*  is at the behest of Israel, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=415.92s)]
*  including humanitarian aid. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=417.92s)]
*  The Israeli government has thus [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=419.92s)]
*  far refused to open [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=421.92s)]
*  more crossings for [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=423.92s)]
*  humanitarian aid going into Gaza, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=425.92s)]
*  which is why you're seeing [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=427.92s)]
*  more and more air drops of [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=429.92s)]
*  aid falling over [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=431.92s)]
*  the strip just over the weekend. The US [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=433.92s)]
*  air dropped humanitarian [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=435.92s)]
*  aid into Gaza for the first time since [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=437.92s)]
*  the war began nearly five months [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=439.92s)]
*  ago, calling it a success. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=441.92s)]
*  38,000 [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=443.92s)]
*  meals flew over [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=445.92s)]
*  Gaza's coastline, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=447.92s)]
*  but for over 2 [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=449.92s)]
*  million people at risk of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=451.92s)]
*  famine, that is just [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=453.92s)]
*  a drop in the ocean, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=455.92s)]
*  quite literally. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=457.92s)]
*  Some humanitarian organizations [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=459.92s)]
*  criticize the move, pointing [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=461.92s)]
*  out that it is an ineffective [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=463.92s)]
*  way to deliver [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=465.92s)]
*  aid, and in the US Capitol, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=467.92s)]
*  what looked like hundreds of protesters [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=469.92s)]
*  gathered outside the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=471.92s)]
*  Israeli embassy calling up what they [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=473.92s)]
*  say is US [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=475.92s)]
*  hypocrisy. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=477.92s)]
*  Out of all the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=479.92s)]
*  options the US has at its [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=481.92s)]
*  disposal to end this [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=483.92s)]
*  tragedy, that's [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=485.92s)]
*  what they chose to do. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=487.92s)]
*  We're dropping [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=489.92s)]
*  some food and we're dropping the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=491.92s)]
*  bombs and the tanks and [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=493.92s)]
*  the bullets and everything else [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=495.92s)]
*  at the same time. That's what he's got to do, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=497.92s)]
*  stop sending the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=499.92s)]
*  money and the weapons. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=501.92s)]
*  And if there is any one country [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=505.92s)]
*  that can apply pressure on Israel, it is [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=507.92s)]
*  of course the United States. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=509.92s)]
*  But despite Washington seemingly [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=511.92s)]

*  one thing remains unchanged. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  It's unwavering military [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=519.9200000000001s)]
*  and financial [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=521.9200000000001s)]
*  support. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=523.9200000000001s)]

*  consistent with their national [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=529.9200000000001s)]

*  support them militarily. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=533.9200000000001s)]
*  Since the start of what [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=535.92s)]
*  so many people have [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=537.92s)]
*  described as this horrific [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=539.92s)]
*  war, President Biden [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=541.92s)]
*  has bypassed Congress twice [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbk4KgOaRic&t=543.92s)]
