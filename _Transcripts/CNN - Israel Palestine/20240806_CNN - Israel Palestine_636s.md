# Hamas announces Yahya Sinwar as head of political bureau
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0)
*  Hamas, as in the last few moments announced, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=0.0s)]
*  that Yaya Sinwar will replace Ismail Haniyeh [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=2.84s)]
*  as the group's political leader. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=6.04s)]
*  Sinwar, of course, is the group's leader in Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=8.44s)]
*  The change comes after Haniyeh, war-skilled, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=12.08s)]
*  if you remember, last week in Tehran. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=15.4s)]
*  We'll have more on that with this news just coming in, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=18.68s)]
*  and Hamas announcing Sinwar as the head of the political bureau. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=20.88s)]
*  In the meantime, and staying in the region, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=26.28s)]
*  US officials tell CNN Iran and its proxies [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=28.08s)]
*  are beginning preparations for a retaliatory attack against Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=30.599999999999998s)]
*  The entire Middle East has been on edge for days, in fact, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=34.64s)]
*  after a series of assassinations blamed on Israel, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=37.72s)]
*  including the deaths of Sinya Hamas and Hezbollah figures. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=40.56s)]
*  Two officials say fears are higher right now [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=44.0s)]
*  about a major response from Hezbollah, rather than Iran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=46.28s)]
*  Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, you're seeing there, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=50.32s)]
*  vowed his group will act, whether alone or with regional allies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=53.0s)]
*  Hezbollah has already declared a new phase, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=57.64s)]
*  what it calls a new phase in its months-long cross-border conflict with Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=59.84s)]
*  Today, it says it fired a swarm of drones at Israeli military targets. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=63.68s)]
*  And a Hezbollah rocket barrage triggered fires [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=68.44s)]
*  near Kiryat Shemona in northern Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=71.28s)]
*  Adding to the tensions, the US military is blaming Iran-backed militias [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=74.68s)]
*  for a suspected rocket attack on this air base in Iraq, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=78.72s)]
*  calling it a dangerous escalation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Seven US service members were injured. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  Let's get more on all these threads. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=88.28s)]
*  And Natasha Gertran is following developments for us from the Pentagon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=90.08s)]
*  So, Natasha, we've heard Iran say they will respond. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=93.16s)]
*  The question now is when and how. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=95.68s)]
*  What are you hearing from US sources and US officials [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=97.84s)]
*  as to what retaliation, that retaliation may look like right now? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=101.28s)]
*  Well, US officials don't seem to know exactly what that's going to look like. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=105.72s)]
*  And that's in part because they don't know if Iran even knows at this point [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=109.28s)]
*  what they're going to do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=112.64s)]
*  But they are more concerned now, we're told, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=113.68s)]
*  about what Hezbollah is going to do than what Iran is planning. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  We're told that in recent days, the fears have escalated [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=120.2s)]
*  about the idea that Hezbollah could actually act alone [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=123.2s)]
*  and not be coordinated with Tehran in its response. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=126.56s)]
*  And, of course, Hezbollah is just right there on Israel's northern border. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=130.56s)]
*  And so this could be something very significant that we see from Hezbollah, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=134.60000000000002s)]
*  or it could result, all the diplomacy that we are seeing in the background [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=137.8s)]
*  could result in all sides kind of de-escalating tensions. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=142.56s)]
*  It does not seem necessarily like that is what is going to happen at this point. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=145.68s)]
*  US officials are bracing for some kind of retaliatory action, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=148.8s)]
*  but they're trying to essentially temper it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=152.8s)]
*  and try to make sure that any kind of action will not result, of course, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=155.72s)]
*  in a large number of civilian casualties, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=159.28s)]
*  that it will be more largely symbolic and allow either Tehran or Hezbollah or both [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=161.0s)]
*  to kind of save face, you know, in light of these Israeli strikes [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  in both Beirut and Tehran. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=168.88s)]
*  And so we know from US officials that both Iran and Hezbollah [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=170.56s)]
*  have been making some kind of preparations for some kind of attack on Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  But again, US officials have declined to say what exactly that looks like. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  I will note, however, that before the attack, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  the Iranian attack against Israel in April, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=185.24s)]
*  US officials saw very, very clear signs of very large movements by Iran, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=187.84s)]
*  including the movement of, for example, major missile launchers [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=191.8s)]
*  and things like that into position to prepare for a major attack. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=195.8s)]
*  They're not necessarily seeing those kinds of huge signs at this point, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=199.52s)]
*  forecasting something potentially as significant as a massive missile barrage [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=202.72s)]
*  like we saw a few months ago. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  But of course, they're basically preparing for the worst here [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  and engaging in this very frenetic diplomacy behind the scenes [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=211.0s)]
*  to try to ease tensions even further. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=213.8s)]
*  So we'll have to see if that works. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  Natasha, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  Let's talk more really about the growing threat of a wider war in the Middle East. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=219.44s)]
*  Joining me now is Colin Clark, Director of Policy and Research at the Sufan Group, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=223.96s)]
*  a well-known face here on the show. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=227.72s)]
*  Colin, great to see you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=229.48s)]
*  Just some breaking news that we've had in the last few minutes. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=230.32s)]
*  I'm not sure if you caught it. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=232.28s)]
*  We've now heard that Hamas has issued a statement announcing that its leader in Gaza, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=233.32s)]
*  Yaya Sinwar, will replace Ismail Haniyeh, of course, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  who was assassinated in Tehran last week as the head of its political bureau. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=241.92s)]
*  What do you make of this announcement? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=250.76s)]
*  I think the announcement could be quite significant. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=252.0s)]
*  And it's really interesting because you now see Hamas [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=254.32s)]
*  potentially attempting to bring closer the political bureau and the military wing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=257.64s)]
*  by having a military leader like Sinwar kind of dual-hatted functioning in both roles. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=263.28s)]
*  It certainly points to a victory for the hardliners within Hamas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=268.84s)]
*  Some of the other names that have been mentioned, Khalid Mashal has some issues [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  in his relationship with some of the kind of Hamas adjacent countries in the region, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=278.8s)]
*  including the Syrians and the Iranians. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  And so this was likely a move to empower the more hardline militants in the group. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=286.52s)]
*  It could also have reverberations into the West Bank as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=292.64s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to say this doesn't bode well because, of course, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  Ismail Haniyeh was part of the negotiations we so thought as part of the wing, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=299.71999999999997s)]
*  the political side, the political bureau of Hamas. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=305.84s)]
*  And of course, Israel has publicly accused Sinwar of being the mastermind, right, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  behind the terror attack against Israel on October 7. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=314.64s)]
*  So it begs the question of where does this leave any sort of ceasefire, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  any hostage negotiations now with Yair Sinwar as the head of the political bureau for Hamas? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=324.4s)]
*  Well, I think what it does first and foremost is it complicates the day after, right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=333.24s)]
*  We hear a lot of discussions about the day after and how the Israelis haven't really been [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  planning for that. They haven't strategized for the day after. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=342.72s)]
*  A lot of that is because of the role of Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right allies. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  They refuse to kind of think about any kind of Gaza governance. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  This really, really complicates that because, let's say, the war was to stop this week [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  and Sinwar was not captured or killed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=360.16s)]
*  He'd be the individual representing Hamas there. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=362.44000000000005s)]
*  And there's no way the Israelis are going to do business with Sinwar [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=365.76000000000005s)]
*  in any kind of post-conflict governance in Gaza. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=369.36s)]
*  Yeah. Stay with us, Colin. I want to go to our Jeremy Diamond, who's in Haifa for this breaking news. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=373.2s)]
*  And Jeremy, just as we bring our viewers up to date with this breaking news, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=379.2s)]
*  that Hamas announcing Sinwar as the head of the political bureau, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  what has been the reaction from Israel to this? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=386.48s)]
*  Well, we haven't gotten any reaction yet, but I can tell you what the reaction will be. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=392.16s)]
*  And that is to say that Yahya Sinwar, taking over as Hamas's political leader, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  first of all increasingly blurs the lines between Hamas's military wing and its political wing. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=402.32s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar was viewed as very much the bridge between those two wings. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=407.68s)]
*  And in addition to that, he is also viewed as responsible for the October 7 massacre. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=412.0s)]
*  In the same way that Mohammed Daif was the leader of the military wing, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=419.36s)]
*  there is a belief, a strong belief, that Yahya Sinwar would have been intimately involved, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=423.24s)]
*  if not in the planning, then certainly in the decision-making about choosing to carry out such an attack. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=428.2s)]
*  And what this also does is it makes very clear that Yahya Sinwar, despite more than 10 months of war, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=434.52s)]
*  is clearly alive, clearly still very influential within Hamas, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=441.96s)]
*  to the point that he is able to actually seize power here in the wake of Ismail Haniyeh's assassination. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=447.36s)]
*  And what that will do, beyond what I've already mentioned, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=453.36s)]
*  is also clearly show that the hardliners within Hamas are clearly being empowered. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=456.2s)]
*  Ismail Haniyeh was viewed in many ways as a more pragmatic voice within Hamas, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=462.68s)]
*  as a voice who was pushing for a ceasefire, who was willing to make certain concessions at the negotiating table. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=469.44s)]
*  And Yahya Sinwar, who has been consulted at every step in those ceasefire negotiations, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=476.16s)]
*  was very much viewed as carrying the more hardline position. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=480.48s)]
*  And so that obviously, I think it's pretty clear what that means for the future of ceasefire negotiations, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=484.36s)]
*  for how much more difficult it may be to actually achieve a ceasefire. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=491.16s)]
*  And obviously, this will have tremendous implications in Gaza itself, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=495.52s)]
*  where we know that the lack of a ceasefire is impacting Gazan civilians more than anyone else, perhaps. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I assume that Yahya Sinwar is in hiding in Gaza. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=506.52s)]
*  Do we know what role he has played in these negotiations, while, of course, when Haniyeh was still alive? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  Do we know how prominent his viewpoint, how influential he's been in these negotiations, Jeremy? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=518.16s)]
*  It's been critical at every single juncture, Isa, because Hamas's political leadership outside of Gaza [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=525.16s)]
*  knew that it could not implement a ceasefire, it could not stop the fighting without the agreement of Hamas leaders in Gaza, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=532.76s)]
*  which effectively gave Sinwar a veto over every decision that has been made at the negotiating table so far. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=540.88s)]
*  But now he is empowered even further because we're not just talking about a veto, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=547.68s)]
*  we're talking about actual decision making power and authority. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=552.24s)]
*  And one other thing that we should note is that Sinwar, as he has been consulted at every critical juncture, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=556.08s)]
*  that sometimes led to delays in those negotiations because of the fact that Sinwar is believed to be hiding in tunnels under Gaza, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=561.72s)]
*  most likely under Khan Yunus. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=569.72s)]
*  It was taking it could take as little as hours sometimes, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=572.08s)]
*  but oftentimes it would take days for the messages to go from Doha or Cairo, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=575.04s)]
*  from the mediating, from the negotiating table into Gaza to actually reach Sinwar in a covert manner [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=580.52s)]
*  without the Israelis discovering where he was hiding, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=586.92s)]
*  and then for those messages to reach back to the negotiating table thereafter. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=589.56s)]
*  And so that is going to be clearly another factor in the potential future of those talks. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=594.16s)]
*  But we should note that for now, these negotiations are effectively dead for the time being, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  at least in the short term. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=606.5999999999999s)]
*  Following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, there has been no progress towards another ceasefire deal. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=608.24s)]
*  And instead, what we are talking about, particularly where I am now in northern Israel, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=614.56s)]
*  is this possibility, very real possibility of an Iranian attack against Israel in retaliation for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=618.8s)]
*  as well as potentially attacks from Hezbollah, which is just about 30 kilometers north of here at the border of Lebanon. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=626.5999999999999s)]
*  Jeremy, I appreciate it. Thank you very much for coming up for this breaking news. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCj5pErbl0&t=632.4399999999999s)]
