# Father describes discovering his daughter's body days after Hamas attack in booby-trapped home
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU)
*  Endless lemons, and here there is more. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=0.0s)]
*  Millions of fruits and vegetables without end. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=3.0s)]
*  Her name was Adi Kaplun. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=6.0s)]
*  She and her husband Anani moved to Kibbutz Holit near Gaza to build a life together. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=8.0s)]
*  This is our bedroom, and the bed was built by my husband. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=13.0s)]
*  Adi gave a tour to an Israeli news station a few years ago. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=17.0s)]
*  I study Judaism, and it helps to calm me, and some of the lessons are practical. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=22.0s)]
*  We know this language, but we speak in a different dialect. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=27.0s)]
*  On the morning of October 7, Anani was out on a sunrise hike with friends, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=30.0s)]
*  while Adi was home with their three-year-old son Negev and six-month-old son Eshel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=34.0s)]
*  Her dad, Yaron, was visiting the Kibbutz, staying in the guest house across the street. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=39.0s)]
*  And then? Hamas attacked. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=44.0s)]
*  All the shooting started at 6.30 in the morning. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=48.0s)]
*  I immediately called her to ask if I can come be with her. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=51.0s)]
*  She said, absolutely not. No way, definitely not. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=55.0s)]
*  She said, Dad, stay in the apartment. Don't come out and close yourself in the safe room. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=59.0s)]
*  Of course, I listened to her. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=65.0s)]
*  Hamas terrorists arrived on motorcycle and foot, killing innocent civilians and migrant workers. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=67.0s)]
*  Yaron closed himself off in a safe room, as did Adi, hiding with her sons in her house's safe room. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=73.0s)]
*  We hear shooting, then quiet. Another house. Shooting, then quiet. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=81.0s)]
*  At 12.30, Adi sends me a text message. Dad, lock the door strongly. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=87.0s)]
*  We guess that according to what happened afterward, that was when they came into her house. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=92.0s)]
*  There was shooting, there was lots of shooting noises, very loud, very close to me. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=97.0s)]
*  I tried to call her. She didn't answer. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=102.0s)]
*  After a few times, the phone was disconnected. I already had a bad feeling. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=105.0s)]
*  Yaram had no way of knowing Hamas terrorists had dragged his grandson, Negav Ineshal, to another house, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=110.0s)]
*  where Hamas terrorists then fired into a shelter and killed Chaim Katzman, and then dragged out Avital Alajem. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=116.0s)]
*  They took me to the living room and then came more terrorists with the children of my friend Adi, which is, she is still missing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=124.0s)]
*  They gave me Eshel, which is four and a half months old, and Negav, who is almost four years old, both traumatized. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=132.0s)]
*  And they just gave them to me. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=144.0s)]
*  Avital, Negav, and Eshel were then kidnapped and dragged at gunpoint to Gaza as hostages. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=147.0s)]
*  Hamas then even used images of Negav in propaganda to show how compassionate they were, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=155.0s)]
*  propaganda that appeared in Arabic media that we will not show you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=162.0s)]
*  The reality, of course, was far different. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=167.0s)]
*  They were traumatized. They were shocked. Negav had a bullet that crossed his foot. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=170.0s)]
*  And Eshel, the baby, he was breathing so much gunfire and his lungs were absorbing so much. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, both of them were traumatized and they were just quiet. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=190.0s)]
*  They kept like, you know, gazing at the terrorists with terrified eyes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=194.0s)]
*  Negav, the four-year-old, he was wounded. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=200.0s)]
*  So he couldn't walk. He was crawling. He was crying. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=203.0s)]
*  And it was a traumatizing experience. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=209.0s)]
*  Miraculously, Avital managed to escape with the boys, and they were able to reunite with their father. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=212.0s)]
*  Yaron was rescued from his safe room by Israeli soldiers. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=219.0s)]
*  They searched Adi's house. They found nothing and no one. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=223.0s)]
*  The entire house was filled with so many bullets, bullets from a firearm. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=229.0s)]
*  The door of the safe room, the door looked awful. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=234.0s)]
*  It was full of holes, full of bullet holes, dozens of bullets. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=237.0s)]
*  Then the mystery. Where was Adi? Where was she? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=242.0s)]
*  We don't know. She's missing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=247.0s)]
*  Days passed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=249.0s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't even touch my shoulders. I was so tense. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=250.0s)]
*  And then the grim answer came. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=254.0s)]
*  Adi had been murdered. Her body was booby-trapped. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=257.0s)]
*  It had been hidden in her house. It had been there the whole time. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=261.0s)]
*  It turned out afterward that because it didn't move anything, everything was booby-trapped with grenades. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=266.0s)]
*  And only after three days, it turned out that Adi was underneath all the mess under the bed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=272.0s)]
*  They shot her. They shot her really cruelly. They really murdered her. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=277.0s)]
*  All the bullets that were in the door, her body absorbed some of them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=282.0s)]
*  It's a terrible ending. But there is an end. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=286.0s)]
*  And every day it just gets worse. There's more hostages. There's more. Yeah, it's terrible. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=290.0s)]
*  You know, just the three days waiting, not knowing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=297.0s)]
*  I can't imagine the people who were 17 days and now waiting and don't know. I can't imagine. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=303.0s)]
*  The grandsons thankfully were alive. But how is Negev today? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=311.0s)]
*  What had he seen? His foot is now healing. But what of his heart? What of his soul? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=315.0s)]
*  I know that he was told right from the start that his mother was not coming back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=322.0s)]
*  I don't know how he's processing it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=329.0s)]
*  What was the purpose of killing Adi Kaplun? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=332.0s)]
*  What does it achieve to kill her in front of her baby boys? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=335.0s)]
*  For now, all the Jackie and Yaron can do is grieve the loss of their beloved daughter and hug their grandsons. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=339.0s)]
*  I came first to the hospital. Negev was eating supper at the time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=346.0s)]
*  And he told me, Saba, come sit beside me. I'm eating supper and I want you to sit beside me. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=354.0s)]
*  I was just so glad to see that he was running around and that Eshel has the most beautiful smile. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=364.0s)]
*  And I got to hold him. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZYv3UWNTSU&t=371.0s)]
