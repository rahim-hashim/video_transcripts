# Hear why Palestinians fear more evictions in the occupied West Bank with Trump presidency
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs)
*  After a conflict that escalated dramatically over the past two months, there are now fresh [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=0.0s)]
*  hopes for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=4.24s)]
*  A source says that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved the emerging [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  deal in principle and that the Israeli Cabinet is going to be voting on the agreement on [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Tuesday, this happening as the death toll climbs in Lebanon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Lebanese officials say that dozens were killed in Israeli strikes in Beirut and beyond over [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=21.68s)]
*  the weekend. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=26.2s)]
*  Lebanon's health ministry says that Israeli strikes have killed more than 3,000 people [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=27.24s)]
*  since mid-September. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=31.56s)]
*  The IDF says it struck a dozen Hezbollah command centers in Beirut Sunday night. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=33.36s)]
*  Hezbollah fired some 250 projectiles from Lebanon on Sunday. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=38.16s)]
*  Some were intercepted by Israel's air defenses. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=42.4s)]
*  Let's bring in Nick Robertson joining us live now from Jerusalem. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=45.6s)]
*  So Nick, just talk us through what more we know about this potential ceasefire agreement [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=48.96s)]
*  between Israel and Hezbollah, including the 60-day transition period and also the fact [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=53.0s)]
*  that the Israeli military would be required to withdraw from southern Lebanon. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=57.96s)]
*  Take us through that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=61.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I think the indications are not just coming from here in Israel that this [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=62.76s)]
*  Cabinet meeting that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held last night with his members [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=68.64s)]
*  of Cabinet and his senior security officials gave rise to this decision to have another [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=73.16s)]
*  Cabinet meeting and to move in the direction with some reservations about the ceasefire. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=77.88s)]
*  But also we've been hearing that from in the region as well, from outside of Israel, that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  they feel that a deal is getting close. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  There's been a significant uptick in the military escalation on both sides. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=90.96s)]
*  On Sunday, for example, 250 Hezbollah rockets and missiles fired into Israel. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=94.84s)]
*  That's a huge number. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=99.84s)]
*  And again, on the Israeli side, a huge number of IDF strikes going into Lebanon at Hezbollah [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=100.84s)]
*  targets. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=105.88s)]
*  That's symptomatic, if we compare it to back in 2006, when there was similar ceasefire [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=108.16s)]
*  deal was struck back then between Hezbollah and the Israeli government. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  There was an uptick in violence and exchanges of fire just before the ceasefire. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=115.88s)]
*  So some of the atmospherics around this look right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=120.92s)]
*  The prime minister is indicating the country is moving in that direction. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=125.6s)]
*  Reservations, I think one of the principal reservations we've heard about is the fact [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=129.28s)]
*  want to be able to strike Hezbollah immediately if they violate the ceasefire during that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=133.72s)]
*  60 day period. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=138.64s)]
*  The foreign minister today laid out equal terms. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=139.64s)]
*  Hezbollah pulling back 30 miles north of the border, north of the Latani River. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=143.72s)]
*  That's back to an old UN agreed position that Hezbollah hadn't stuck to. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  They want as well, the foreign minister was saying, for Hezbollah not to be allowed to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=152.6s)]
*  rebuild and rearm itself going forward. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  That seems to be a big ask in a sovereign country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=159.36s)]
*  But that's one of the things they're saying. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  But I think perhaps the sharpest thorn in the side of the Israeli prime minister at [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=164.82000000000002s)]
*  the moment is his hard right members of his cabinet. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=169.08s)]
*  It's my Ben Gavir, the national security minister today said he told the prime minister that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=172.28s)]
*  absolutely not that he should not stop fighting Hezbollah, that they were weakened and that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  this was the moment to crush them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=181.4s)]
*  And he said, you know, continue, continue, continue. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=182.96s)]
*  Those were his words, he said to the prime minister. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  So it seems to be where the direction he may vote in tomorrow. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=188.16s)]
*  Obviously, the prime minister has time to discuss this with all the different parties [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=193.4s)]
*  in his coalition before then. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=198.12s)]
*  But I don't it does appear that the that what we're hearing from the prime minister's office [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=200.96s)]
*  is that they feel reasonably confident that this will go through. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=206.56s)]
*  Yeah, because, of course, as we touched on any ceasefire agreement would have to be approved [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=210.72s)]
*  by the Israeli cabinet. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=215.76s)]
*  As you point out, they are set to convene tomorrow, Tuesday. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=217.0s)]
*  So, Nick, I also understand that you've been speaking to Palestinians in the West Bank [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=220.0s)]
*  and talking to them really about what a Trump presidency would mean for the potential rise [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=223.84s)]
*  of Israeli settlers in the area. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  Just take us through that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=230.32s)]
*  Yeah, one of the big concerns is that President Trump's pick for ambassador is Mike Huckabee, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=232.52s)]
*  former Arkansas governor, evangelical Christian, who takes the same view as settlers here [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=238.4s)]
*  that he's also said that he doesn't believe there are Palestinians, that he thinks that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=244.28s)]
*  Israel has the right to the to to the West Bank. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=248.72s)]
*  It's the Occupied West Bank. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=251.88s)]
*  International law says this is land that Israel is occupying. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=253.28s)]
*  But the settlers in this country believe the same thing as Huckabee. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=257.12s)]
*  And there is a strong right wing group within the Israeli cabinet that also believe that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=260.6s)]
*  and want to annex the whole of the West Bank. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=267.8s)]
*  And this is what the new potential ambassador is going to walk into here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=270.76000000000005s)]
*  There is no such thing as a West Bank. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=277.16s)]
*  It's Judea and Samaria. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  Mike Huckabee, an at times controversial visitor to Israel, looks set to return as [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  president-elect Donald Trump's pick to the ambassador. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=286.0s)]
*  If he does, he'll have plenty of friends. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeshay Fleischer, an activist and settler, has met with Huckabee many times. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  He happens to be a great friend of Israel and of the kind of Israel that I represent [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=299.68s)]
*  that lives in its ancestral heartland, which is Judea and Samaria, what on CNN may be called [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=308.68s)]
*  Even the Occupied West Bank. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=309.68s)]
*  Right, even the Occupied West Bank. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=310.68s)]
*  But we don't see it that way. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=312.24s)]
*  But the history of the West Bank is complex and deeply disputed. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=314.2s)]
*  Under international law, Israel is deemed to be occupying the land. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=318.76s)]
*  Huckabee will be arriving when settler violence against Palestinians is significantly up over [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=324.24s)]
*  Trump's last administration. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=333.16s)]
*  And the Israeli government's claim to the land is at its most politically charged in [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=336.16s)]
*  years. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=341.8s)]
*  Powerful right-wing nationalists in the government want to annex the entire Occupied West Bank. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=343.2s)]
*  So too does Fleischer. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=350.88s)]
*  We're still fighting a war of liberation for that piece of land. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  And is Huckabee going to be helpful in that liberation? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  I think he will be. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=357.72s)]
*  Fifty miles north on the fringes of the West Bank Palestinian village Badallah, Israeli [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=360.12s)]
*  diggers are gouging out a new barrier through the middle of Palestinian farms on land they [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=366.20000000000005s)]
*  say is a security risk. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=373.44s)]
*  The Israeli government is in the process of taking more land. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=377.24s)]
*  The head of the council tells me, claiming no security threats here. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=381.24s)]
*  What the media is talking about with Huckabee is already happening, he says. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=387.68s)]
*  These actions are part of Israel's systematic policies to occupy and annex all of this land. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=392.56s)]
*  Their goal is to drive us out of this area. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=399.96s)]
*  He shows me documents he says prove Palestinian families have owned this land for more than [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=403.84s)]
*  a century. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=410.0s)]
*  As we talk, Israeli troops show up to serve an eviction notice on the farmer below. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=411.64s)]
*  He's been told his buildings are unlicensed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  What he's saying is this document is the official document informing him that he has to be off [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  this land by 9am on the 4th of December, otherwise all of this, he loses it. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=426.96s)]
*  Khalid is 60 years old, heartbroken. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=433.64s)]
*  I don't know how to describe my feelings to you, he says. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=438.64000000000004s)]
*  This is my livelihood. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=442.6s)]
*  My children rely on it. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=444.16s)]
*  Then someone comes along and takes it away. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=446.12s)]
*  You can't argue with them. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=448.88s)]
*  We have no power. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=450.56s)]
*  They have the power. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=452.0s)]
*  In the villages around here, they call this silent annexation. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  Little by little, the Palestinians losing their land to Israeli settlement expansion. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=459.56s)]
*  If Israel unilaterally annexes large parts, large swaths of the West Bank, this is not [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=467.24s)]
*  going to fly well in the Arab world. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  Pinkus is a former Israeli diplomat, believes Huckabee's settler friends could harm Trump's [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  bigger objectives, Saudi Israel normalization. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  He's going to be pressured by the Saudis, the Qataris and the Emiratis to strike a bigger [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=487.96s)]
*  deal. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=494.44s)]
*  I want to build on the Abraham Accords. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=495.44s)]
*  Saudi Arabia very soon. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=499.08s)]
*  The price of which Trump's biggest regional friend, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=500.96s)]
*  says is a Palestinian state. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=507.44s)]
*  Maybe there is an opportunity with Saudi Arabia for us, and that is why we're closely coordinating [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=510.44s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=516.84s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority's former prime minister believes it's Trump's friends who'll triumph [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=518.52s)]
*  in influencing the Israeli government, not Huckabee's. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biZZqq6Pwqs&t=524.92s)]
