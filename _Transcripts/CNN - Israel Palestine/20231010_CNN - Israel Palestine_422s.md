# Putin breaks silence on Hamas attack on Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM)
*  And welcome back to a special edition of Outfront, live from Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=0.0s)]
*  We've got breaking news. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=8.96s)]
*  We are now learning that the death toll from the Hamas attacks on Israel has gone up significantly. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=10.1s)]
*  That number is now at least 1,200 people, according to an Israeli public broadcaster. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=15.22s)]
*  And we had been saying about 1,000, so that number going up by at least 200 here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  And it comes as questions grow about who was behind the attack. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=27.1s)]
*  And today, Vladimir Putin had a very tepid response to Hamas' attack, which killed at [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=31.98s)]
*  least two Russian citizens. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=37.14s)]
*  Fred Pleitgen is out front. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=39.02s)]
*  After hundreds of Israelis were slaughtered by Hamas near Gaza, condemnation and condolences [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=47.22s)]
*  poured in from around the world, but not from Russian leader Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  Now in his first comments, instead of empathy, Putin blasting the U.S. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=57.54s)]
*  This is a clear example of the failure of the United States policy in the Middle East, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=63.86s)]
*  which tried to monopolize any settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=68.1s)]
*  Kremlin-controlled TV following suit, mocking both America and Israel for allegedly being [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=75.5s)]
*  caught off guard by Hamas' attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=80.82s)]
*  Mossad and its famous counterintelligence, as well as the U.S. and its CIA, slept through [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=84.34s)]
*  Hamas' invasion. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=90.9s)]
*  It's the biggest Israeli failure in security since 1973. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  Russia has long been allied with Israel's staunchest adversaries and Hamas' most important [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=98.14s)]
*  backers, bombing Syrian rebels in support of pro-Iranian fighters battling on the side [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=103.5s)]
*  of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's civil war. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=108.86s)]
*  But Russia also maintained strong ties and security arrangements with Israel. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=114.58s)]
*  Putin meeting Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on many occasions. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=120.58s)]
*  We in no way underestimate importance of measures that would ensure very strong security of [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=124.7s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=134.94s)]
*  But since Putin launched his full-scale war against Ukraine, Tehran has become a key ally [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=137.34s)]
*  for Moscow at Israel's expense, fostering economic and military ties with Iran, while [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=142.22s)]
*  Tehran provides the Russian army with scores of Shahed drones the Russians use to hit Ukrainian [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=147.9s)]
*  cities and infrastructure, Kiev says, even though Tehran denies it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=153.82s)]
*  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claiming Moscow's allegiance in the Middle East has [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=158.94s)]
*  shifted towards Tehran. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=163.18s)]
*  We see how Russian propagandists are gloating. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=168.1s)]
*  We witness how Moscow's Iranian allies openly lend support to those who attacked Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=171.38s)]
*  And Aaron, the Kremlin has denied Volodymyr Zelenskyy's allegations that the Russians [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=177.5s)]
*  are trying to inflame the situations between the Israelis and the Palestinians. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=181.01999999999998s)]
*  However, the former chief rabbi of Moscow, who of course fled Russia about two weeks [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  after the full-on invasion of Ukraine, he today said that the lack of show of support [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=190.82s)]
*  Israel is an ominous sign of deteriorating relations between those countries. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=197.62s)]
*  Aaron? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=202.34s)]
*  Fred, thank you very much. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=203.34s)]
*  And out front now, the former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations and Israel's former [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=206.54s)]
*  Deputy Defense Minister Danny Danone. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=210.74s)]
*  And I really appreciate your time, Ambassador. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  So Fred's reporting Russian citizens are killed in the attack, Putin silent, really for days. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=215.22s)]
*  Many Russians live in Israel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=222.86s)]
*  There are very close ties between those two countries as well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=224.06s)]
*  And yet Putin showing virtually no sympathy at all for Israel. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=227.34s)]
*  Nothing at this point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=230.62s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=231.62s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=232.9s)]
*  We have witnessed a whole attack against Israelis. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=234.86s)]
*  Twelve hundred people were killed, butchered in the daylight. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=237.7s)]
*  So we expect more than a leader. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=241.5s)]
*  We saw President Biden's speech and we appreciated his speech. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=243.7s)]
*  It was very emotional. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=246.66s)]
*  It was a remarkable speech, I have to tell you, because we are still digesting those [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=247.66s)]
*  attacks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=252.3s)]
*  It was very hard for us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=253.34s)]
*  The pain is still in our stomach and we are grateful for the support coming from the US, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=254.34s)]
*  from Europe, from almost all over the world. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=259.14s)]
*  I cannot explain Putin's behavior. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  So Fred Pliken pointed out Russia's long been allied with Iran. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=264.22s)]
*  And of course, we've seen that intensify, if I could use that word, with the Ukraine [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=268.66s)]
*  war as well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=273.1s)]
*  Iran is the key backer of Hamas. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=274.82s)]
*  Do you think that if Iran had any advanced knowledge that Russia would have had advanced [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=277.1s)]
*  knowledge? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=282.22s)]
*  Are there any ties here that you're starting to tie together? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=284.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, Iran is very involved in what's happening here. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=285.94000000000005s)]
*  They are funding Hamas and Hezbollah for years. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=288.54s)]
*  They are training Hamas operatives. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  We know that Hamas experts went to Tehran to get training about explosives and other [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=293.98s)]
*  things. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=298.42s)]
*  So we know Iran is involved. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=299.42s)]
*  And maybe, I don't know for sure, but maybe what we saw in the last few weeks, the relationship [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=300.42s)]
*  between Israel and Saudi Arabia, it wasn't very good for Iran. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  So maybe that is a reason for the timing, because it was an unprovoked attack against [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=309.06s)]
*  Israel. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=312.62s)]
*  Nobody can find logic for the timing of this vicious attack. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=313.62s)]
*  So how involved do you think Iran was? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=316.94s)]
*  I mean, the White House has been careful. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=319.06s)]
*  They've sort of said that there's ambiguous ties, that Iran is broadly and complicit, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  but that there's no intelligence directly linking Iran to this actual attack. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=326.06s)]
*  Do you buy that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=330.5s)]
*  No. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=331.74s)]
*  When you fund the Hamas and you give them hundreds of millions of dollars every year, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=332.74s)]
*  you control Hamas. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=337.22s)]
*  So basically, both Hamas and Hezbollah are proxies of Tehran. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=338.58s)]
*  They control them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  And that is why we're sending a very clear message today to Hezbollah and to Tehran. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  Watch very carefully what will happen in Gaza. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=348.38s)]
*  Don't mess with us. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=350.74s)]
*  We are not playing anymore. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=351.74s)]
*  We're going to hunt down Hamas. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=352.74s)]
*  And if anyone will try to play with us, either from north or somewhere else, he will be under [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=354.74s)]
*  our guns as well. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  So as you are massing IDF forces, paratroopers, snipers along that Gaza border, is there anything [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=363.02s)]
*  that will be off limits? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=370.82s)]
*  When, if, I assume at this point is when Israel goes in? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=372.62s)]
*  We will do whatever is necessary to eliminate Hamas. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=378.14s)]
*  We're going to come from the sea. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=381.82s)]
*  We're going to come from the land. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=382.82s)]
*  We're going to come from the air. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=384.09999999999997s)]
*  We're going to hunt them down. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=385.41999999999996s)]
*  They butchered 1,200 Israelis and they went to the communities. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=387.21999999999997s)]
*  They didn't attack soldiers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=391.38s)]
*  They attacked women. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=392.38s)]
*  Today we actually saw the pictures of innocent babies that were tied up and burned alive. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  Those are animals. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=400.06s)]
*  We have to fight them. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=401.21999999999997s)]
*  We have to hunt them down. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  And we are committed to do it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=403.88s)]
*  We are still in pain, in shock. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=405.3s)]
*  And I think in a few days we will start to show the might of the IDF, the strength of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=407.86s)]
*  the Israeli people. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=412.86s)]
*  We put politics aside now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  We are united and we're going to go into war against Hamas. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=415.78s)]
*  Ambassador Danone, thank you very much. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=419.42s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a34zpFaoBoM&t=420.98s)]
