**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw)
*  Now to someone who has experienced the terror of October 7th, Ahiyyad Ben Yitzhak is a survivor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=0.0s)]
*  He was enjoying life with friends on the beach on October 7th in Israel when bullets and missiles [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  began to rain down around them. He and his friends tried to escape. They did manage to get to an army [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=10.8s)]
*  base. They were first turned away but eventually led inside but they weren't safe at all when they [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=16.56s)]
*  got there. He decided to leave and make a run for his car eventually having to abandon it even after [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=20.96s)]
*  he was shot. He wrote this harrowing story of survival and he joins us now to remind people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=26.96s)]
*  of what happened on October 7th and to remember his friend who was killed almost two months ago. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=33.2s)]
*  First and foremost, how are you doing? How is your injury? But more importantly because I see you're [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  standing here before us, how are you mentally? How are you done? I'm fine and I'm really excited to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=43.6s)]
*  be here. Like you give me an opportunity and it's part of my healing process to talk about it and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=48.64s)]
*  it's really helpful. You know I need some time. I think about it a lot. It's tough but I'm fine. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=56.56s)]
*  Like generally fine. And most of the time I'm sad because I just heard about the Beavis family. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=66.0s)]
*  It's the first time I hear about it and it's it's break my heart but I'm fine. I'm okay. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  You're here with us. You're here. You're breathing. You're alive and that's really [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=83.44s)]
*  the most important thing but this is a lot to go through. I read your, I thought it was a journal [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=88.72s)]
*  entry but I think you said it just kind of came out of you. You wrote it first in Hebrew and then [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=94.0s)]
*  it was translated and I just want to read a bit of that because it really struck me this morning [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=98.48s)]
*  and had me at that point where I was choking up and I could feel the fear in your words. You say [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=103.28s)]
*  in a bit here you had gotten to this military installation. You left because you could see that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=109.28s)]
*  they were going to be overwhelmed. Basically the fighting was coming in and you say this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=115.68s)]
*  I hear the most dreadful boom as you're running away pinging, echoing against the metal of the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=119.6s)]
*  vehicle that you had just gotten into, filed by successive gunshots, popping sounds of death. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=124.56s)]
*  Even before I started driving I thought I had brought extinction to all of us. Here we are [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=130.56s)]
*  being slaughtered in an intimate personal manner, more intimate than sex. Whoever is shooting at us [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=136.32s)]
*  knows us and wants to kill us one by one. We are a target, a prize. They're shooting at us with lust. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=142.72s)]
*  I know they wouldn't let go. This is a new feeling, the feeling of ending. We have no chance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  And here you are. Yeah I'm very lucky guy. How did you get through it? What gave you that? It was [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=157.28s)]
*  a miracle. To be honest it was a miracle. I didn't thought I could get out of there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=162.96s)]
*  Not alive, not in one piece. But I'm here and I stand on both feet. I feel really lucky [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=169.84s)]
*  and I still, like I am overwhelmed, like still overwhelmed. I can see that in your eyes that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=180.88s)]
*  there's a sense of that's too much, right? It was too much. It's too much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  You, speaking of too much, you and some of your friends did survive. You had someone driving, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=192.24s)]
*  you were screaming at him, you were just trying to get and then you you run into the gunman who [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=196.0s)]
*  are shooting at you and turn around, jump out of the car, it catches fire. It's something out of a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=200.08s)]
*  horror movie really. But one of your friends did not survive. Can you tell us about her? Yeah, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=204.88s)]
*  her name is Morgabay. I miss her a lot. She was working with me, with me. She was a cook like I did. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=210.32s)]
*  We had supposed to have a shift the same evening together. She was beautiful. She was so kind [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=219.04000000000002s)]
*  and I just missed her a lot. It's so sad. I think about her a lot and she's missing and I want [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  I want people to know this story like for more memorial. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=239.44s)]
*  And that's it. She's a very good friend of mine and it breaks my heart every day to think about [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=245.68s)]
*  her. She's not here. You did survive. Your friends did survive. You helped them survive. You had no [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=256.8s)]
*  idea but something sort of pushed you to make it and I'm so glad you're here. Thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=262.56s)]
*  Me too. And able to share stories. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so glad to be here. Thank you for [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=269.68s)]
*  this opportunity and thank you for doing this. It's my pleasure. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwqXAoZzVyw&t=273.92s)]
