# Video shows Iranian missile attack on Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE)
*  We are seeing some intercepts on the other end of me here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm going to see, yep, Byron, if you can get off the tripod there. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=3.12s)]
*  You can see some of these interceptor missiles, it seems, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=6.72s)]
*  going into the air right now, into the sky. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=9.76s)]
*  I can see at least three of them right now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=13.8s)]
*  I'm we're facing the cameras now facing south. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=16.36s)]
*  So you can see four. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=19.28s)]
*  We're seeing a fifth one. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=20.68s)]
*  In the air and these appear to be this is very similar to what we saw in April. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=24.04s)]
*  I was in Jerusalem at the time and we could see these various [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=29.44s)]
*  interceptors lighting up the sky as they headed to intercept those various missiles and drones. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=33.56s)]
*  Jeremy, while you're seeing that in northern Israel, we want to go back to Jim [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=38.84s)]
*  Schuto in Tel Aviv, who is seeing something similar. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Jim, Dana. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=46.84s)]
*  Dana, we're seeing them coming from multiple directions here to to my left, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=49.56s)]
*  which is just to the north and to my right, to the south. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=54.28s)]
*  They're over our head. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=57.28s)]
*  I've counted at least half a dozen of this of them at this point. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=58.36s)]
*  We're seeing them rising. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=63.36s)]
*  I have yet to see them strike a target or at least I haven't seen. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=64.64s)]
*  Well, actually now over here, I do see a projectile falling to the ground. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=70.08s)]
*  I think my team probably sees it as well on the right hand side. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=73.68s)]
*  If you directed over there, in fact, you see the flash. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=76.64s)]
*  Just out of camera there, they're easy to see on the way up, Dana. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=82.6s)]
*  They follow a regular speed and pace and trajectory when they come down. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=86.48s)]
*  And this is the one coming down here, I believe. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  They come down a little bit more erratically. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=94.12s)]
*  And you could see it looks to be in more than one piece. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=96.4s)]
*  That indicates to me that those are fragments of an incoming [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=99.64s)]
*  projectile that was hit falling. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=104.4s)]
*  And again, keep in mind, this is a big city and there goes the air raid sirens again. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  Where that fragment just fell is still in a populated, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=112.8s)]
*  a densely populated part of the city. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=117.16s)]
*  So even even if you strike a missile before it's able to hit the target, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=119.0s)]
*  those fragments themselves and the fragments of the intercept missiles themselves [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=123.36s)]
*  also can have an impact and can be dangerous. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=127.88s)]
*  Look at it now. It's it's practically like fireflies [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=130.72s)]
*  over the city of Tel Aviv. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=135.24s)]
*  I mean, you can see right now I'm counting. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=138.88s)]
*  I'm counting, Dana, at least a dozen in the air at one time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=141.68s)]
*  This is a some rising major attack. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=147.04s)]
*  Jim Schuto, this is obviously a major attack. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=151.12s)]
*  There's no question you are seeing what we are all seeing with our own eyes [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=153.32s)]
*  is a major attack from Iran. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=157.12s)]
*  It's a major attack, Dana, and it's an escalation. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=160.6s)]
*  It's an escalation of this war [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=164.2s)]
*  beyond what we saw, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=167.8s)]
*  I think potentially beyond what we saw in April when it when Iran launched [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=170.84s)]
*  dozens of missiles and drones. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=174.68s)]
*  This attack, according to U.S. intelligence, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=178.4s)]
*  principally or perhaps entirely ballistic missiles, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=181.76s)]
*  which are the fastest by far and the most dangerous. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=184.8s)]
*  And now what we're seeing in addition to those intercepts [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=190.32s)]
*  is we're seeing fragments falling to the ground. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=192.84s)]
*  It's like a deadly, a deadly fireworks display over Tel Aviv. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=195.0s)]
*  And you're talking about Tel Aviv. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=201.36s)]
*  And you're talking about Tel Aviv, Jim. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=204.28s)]
*  We are looking at pictures right now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=205.96s)]
*  We are looking at pictures of Tel Aviv, what you're describing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=208.32s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=211.88s)]
*  OK, guys, we got to get off the roof. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=214.8s)]
*  These are coming down right next to us here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  Please do, Jim, please do. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=218.28s)]
*  They're coming down one just about. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=221.4s)]
*  We got to go inside. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=223.56s)]
*  Jim, please take cover. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=226.12s)]
*  We are listening and we are watching. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=249.84s)]
*  We are seeing somebody. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  Sarah, I'm going to go to Jeremy Diamond in northern Israel, Jeremy. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=292.52s)]
*  Dana, from our vantage point in northern Israel, facing south, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=299.0s)]
*  we have been able to see dozens of these apparent intercepts happening [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  in the night sky above us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=307.0s)]
*  We have seen we saw those intermissile intercept missiles [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=308.64s)]
*  going up in the air. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=312.2s)]
*  And now we are seeing as you're seeing one on our screen right now [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=313.47999999999996s)]
*  coming down, they almost look like, you know, fireworks that are breaking up [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=316.12s)]
*  or shooting stars of some sort. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=320.08s)]
*  What I was also able to see earlier was explosions. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=322.32s)]
*  And I had seen videos of these explosions previously. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=325.64s)]
*  It is often that arrow defense system that intercepts ballistic missiles [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=328.8s)]
*  in the first layers of space. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  And it creates a kind of explosion that that looks [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=334.64s)]
*  I don't know how else to say it other than it looks almost like a jellyfish of sorts. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=339.28s)]
*  And that is coming from those intercepts that happen [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=343.52s)]
*  in the first layers of space by the arrow missile defense system. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  And I saw multiple of those happening just now. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=351.08s)]
*  We know, of course, that the threat from Iran tonight was anticipated [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=354.08s)]
*  to be those ballistic missiles that fly at hypersonic speeds [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=357.03999999999996s)]
*  and that often fly at very high altitudes before coming down on their targets. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=361.64s)]
*  And that's why Israel has that arrow missile defense system, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=367.6s)]
*  in addition to the Iron Dome, which we have heard so much about. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=370.36s)]
*  But we have been witnessing dozens of potentially of missiles [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=374.0s)]
*  and intercepts happening in the sky above us. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=377.96s)]
*  It's hard for us to tell exactly how close it is. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=381.0s)]
*  But as we know, many of the targets that we anticipated from hearing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=384.4s)]
*  talking to Israeli and American officials was going to be targets [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=388.6s)]
*  in central Israel as well as in southern Israel. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=392.44s)]
*  And now, of course, we are waiting to see, A, if any of those missiles hit their targets. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=395.52s)]
*  But, of course, beyond that, the debris from some of these intercepts [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=399.55999999999995s)]
*  could also potentially be very damaging, very destructive and very deadly, of course. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  So we will be monitoring very closely reports in the coming minutes [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=408.11999999999995s)]
*  and hours to see what the actual impact of those missiles are on the ground. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=411.88s)]
*  All right, Dana, we're on the roof. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=417.32s)]
*  To be clear, we went into the shelter. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=418.59999999999997s)]
*  We went into the shelter in between the air raid sirens. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=420.79999999999995s)]
*  We've come out again because this is the second round of air raid sirens we've seen. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=424.84s)]
*  And if you look over here in the distance, you're seeing where the missile, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  the intercepts are going up into the sky. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=432.32s)]
*  And it would be just to be clear from that direction, from the east. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=434.91999999999996s)]
*  And again, listen, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=437.64s)]
*  this gives you a sense of the air defenses all around Tel Aviv, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=439.88s)]
*  multiple layers, and this up further in the sky where I'm pointing here. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=443.79999999999995s)]
*  That's the altitude where they're making impacts. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=449.24s)]
*  We saw multiple impacts on the first barrage and some of those fragments [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=452.84s)]
*  or missiles themselves hit not far from the hotel, I want to say. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=457.67999999999995s)]
*  Perhaps and now we're seeing what they're attempting to interest up in the sky. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  Now what I'm going to do, I'm going to take my team off the roof [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=468.03999999999996s)]
*  again to go back into the shelter because they're getting close. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=471.08s)]
*  And when these come down, they can come close to us. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  Guys, let's go back into the shelter. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  We'll check in once it's safe again. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=478.71999999999997s)]
*  Please. Thank you, Jim. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=481.40000000000003s)]
*  I want to go to Alex Marquardt, who is also doing reporting [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=482.92s)]
*  and talking to his sources about the potential impact [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  of what we are seeing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=491.24s)]
*  Obviously, it is still ongoing, Alex. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=492.68s)]
*  Well, Dana, the whole question since the death of the killing [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=494.76s)]
*  of Nasrallah by Israel last week was when and how Iran would respond. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  And now, of course, we are seeing that response. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=503.6s)]
*  So what we're trying to get at is really the scale of this response, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  particularly when it compares to what we saw back on April 13th, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=509.12s)]
*  when more than 300 missiles and drones were fired at Israel, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=512.56s)]
*  frankly, without much impact. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  And the reason that there was not much impact was because of this U.S.-led coalition [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=517.92s)]
*  that helped the Israeli forces to defend their skies. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  And there really was not that much damage or destruction. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=526.36s)]
*  So what we're seeing now is a significant amount of activity in the air. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=528.68s)]
*  We may also be seeing impacts on the ground. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=533.48s)]
*  So that will certainly play into what the Israeli response would be. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=536.76s)]
*  But there is a lot of fog of war right now. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=540.36s)]
*  We really need to figure out what exactly is being fired at Israel [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=542.24s)]
*  and what those what those strikes are going to entail in terms of damage. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=547.72s)]
*  But then there's the question about the defense of Israel. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  The U.S. has been preparing for this kind of scenario for quite some time. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=555.84s)]
*  You remember a couple of months ago, after the killing of the Hamas leader, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=560.72s)]
*  Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=564.72s)]
*  Israel and the U.S. were then expecting an Iranian response that frankly never came. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=565.9200000000001s)]
*  So there has been this framework in place that we're now seeing [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=570.2800000000001s)]
*  being put into action to defend Israel. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=573.44s)]
*  Dana, I'm going to go back to Jim Shudo in Tel Aviv. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=576.12s)]
*  What about that? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=579.1600000000001s)]
*  The notion of the military targets being potentially hit in Israel. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=581.36s)]
*  Does that comply with what you're hearing? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  And most importantly, prior, Dana, prior. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=590.08s)]
*  Prior to the start of the attack, the U.S. Intel read was that the targets [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=594.0400000000001s)]
*  among the targets, I should say, for Iran were air bases, two air bases, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=598.32s)]
*  but also the Mossad headquarters, which is in the northern part of Tel Aviv here. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=603.12s)]
*  There's no question that Tel Aviv is under attack [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=608.24s)]
*  because the number of intercepts we're seeing [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=610.48s)]
*  speaks to this being a target, whether Mossad is the only target in Tel Aviv, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=613.76s)]
*  or if it is indeed is one of the targets, we don't know yet. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=617.96s)]
*  I will tell you, I did see impacts. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=621.2s)]
*  I saw two impacts quite close to the hotel here, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=623.12s)]
*  and I saw another one further north of here, I might guess, a couple [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=625.92s)]
*  a couple of miles where I did see some some fire and explosion again. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=629.92s)]
*  So it is often difficult to determine in the midst of a heavy barrage [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=634.32s)]
*  like this one, what is hitting the ground, actually? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=639.24s)]
*  Is it a fragment of the missile that was fired? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=641.88s)]
*  Is it fragments of the air defense intercept missiles that went up? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=644.24s)]
*  Or both of those things? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=647.52s)]
*  We'll know more over time. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=649.76s)]
*  But there's no question that projectiles are hitting Tel Aviv right now. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtixOrBFmKE&t=650.96s)]
