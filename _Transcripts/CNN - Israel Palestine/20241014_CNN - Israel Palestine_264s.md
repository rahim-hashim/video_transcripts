# ‘We are suffocating’: CNN speaks to migrant workers abandoned in Lebanon
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc)
*  Baby Abdul's life has barely begun and yet when he hears bombs he points to the sky. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=0.0s)]
*  Baby in the night, when the night, he just points up like the sound. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=8.0s)]
*  He and his mother, Mediato Suwari, are one of hundreds of migrant families left with nowhere to go in Lebanon. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=14.0s)]
*  They say they've been abandoned by their employers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=21.0s)]
*  They go, all of them go. I don't know, I don't know where they go. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=24.0s)]
*  Night after night, day after day, Israel's missiles are raining down on the Lebanese capital of Beirut. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=29.0s)]
*  They're hitting the southern suburbs hardest. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=37.0s)]
*  It's where Hezbollah has a strong presence, but it's also where many migrant workers live. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=40.0s)]
*  Migrant workers CNN spoke to described how their employers fled for safety while they were left behind to fend for themselves without the means or paperwork to leave. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=46.0s)]
*  The UN's International Organization for Migration estimates that there are around 170,000 migrant workers in Lebanon and they're predominantly women. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=57.0s)]
*  The kafala, or sponsorship system, used in Lebanon, Jordan and many Gulf countries gives employers almost total control over their freedom of movement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=67.0s)]
*  Some workers told CNN they were refused entry to official government shelters because they're not Lebanese. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=78.0s)]
*  Many resorted to sleeping on the streets. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=83.0s)]
*  The Lebanese governments rejected any accusations of discrimination between displaced people. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=86.0s)]
*  As you can see, some of them have all their stuff with them and some have literally nothing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=91.0s)]
*  Hey mama. Hi. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=96.0s)]
*  Volunteers like Leah Rayyib have stepped in where consulates and embassies have failed to respond, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=98.0s)]
*  identifying buildings to use as makeshift shelters in a country where so-called safe places are shrinking by the day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=103.0s)]
*  So this is the area where we're going to call it the communal bedroom where everybody is sleeping. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=111.0s)]
*  This group of volunteers say they're now helping almost 150 women and six babies from Sierra Leone, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=118.0s)]
*  providing basic things like mattresses, a place to cook and electricity to charge their phones. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=124.0s)]
*  But supplies are running out, resources overwhelmed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=132.0s)]
*  This family from northern Syria are one of many who saw a shelter in a garden close to Marcher Square in downtown Beirut. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=136.0s)]
*  After their neighborhood in the southern suburbs, known as Dahye, came under fire, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=143.0s)]
*  they're one of many. Dada, from Migrant Workers Action, is seeking to help. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=148.0s)]
*  A lot of the migrant workers that are now stranded are undocumented and have expired papers for, in some cases, up to a decade. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=152.0s)]
*  So even if there are attempts from the sending countries' governments to evacuate their citizens, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=160.0s)]
*  most migrant workers have expired residency papers that need penalty fees paid. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=166.0s)]
*  People don't have work anymore, so they can't afford paying these penalty fees that can go up to several hundred dollars. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=170.0s)]
*  Across the city in the mountains a thousand meters above Beirut, a convent has been turned into a temporary shelter [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=177.0s)]
*  for these migrant workers, many from Ethiopia, Sudan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=184.0s)]
*  Three-year-old Zahra's mother Indrani is only too aware how war has dominated her daughter's short life. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=190.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the corner of a first-floor room, Asha from Ethiopia and her husband Khalid hold their four-month-old twins, Amir and Amira. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=207.0s)]
*  The family were forced to flee their home in south Lebanon as Israeli bombing increased. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=216.0s)]
*  The convent is only a temporary shelter. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=221.0s)]
*  The scale of the humanitarian crisis in Lebanon is growing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=235.0s)]
*  Authorities say over 1.2 million people have already been displaced since fighting escalated last month. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=238.0s)]
*  Living rooms now reduced to makeshift tents by the side of busy roads. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=245.0s)]
*  Many of those who came to Lebanon in search of a better life now want nothing but to leave. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAepdI_ZcVc&t=251.0s)]
