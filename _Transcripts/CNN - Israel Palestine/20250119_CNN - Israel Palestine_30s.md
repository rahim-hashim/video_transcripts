*  The sound you hear behind me is the engine of a military helicopter whirring, preparing to take off with these three newly freed hostages aboard. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqDuvIkRX_k&t=0.0s)]
*  Doron Steinbrecher, Emily Demary and Romy Gonen. They have now been freed after more than 15 months of captivity. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqDuvIkRX_k&t=9.0s)]
*  They have been able to embrace their mothers at the Reim military base behind me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqDuvIkRX_k&t=16.0s)]
*  And now as these helicopters prepare to take off, they are on their way to a hospital just outside of Tel Aviv to begin their long journey to recovery. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqDuvIkRX_k&t=20.0s)]
