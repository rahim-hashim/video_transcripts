# Ret. US general talks about the potential military impact of a four-day pause
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew)
*  tonight's hostage deal, which Israel's Cabinet just approved a few minutes ago, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=0.0s)]
*  calls for a four day pause in Israeli military operations in Gaza. Now, before [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=5.0s)]
*  the break, Barak Ravi told us that his sources say that military engagement [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=10.34s)]
*  will not stop until the first child hostage crosses the border from Gaza [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=14.88s)]
*  into Israel. See, it's Jeremy Diamond in is in southern Israel at a vantage [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  point right near the Gaza border can see into Gaza and has been watching much of [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=27.5s)]
*  the fighting over the last several days and weeks. Jeremy, what are you hearing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=32.38s)]
*  tonight? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=35.22s)]
*  Well, just as you were coming to me, John, we heard the sound of outgoing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=38.3s)]
*  artillery and moments after this deal was approved by the Israeli government, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=41.34s)]
*  we heard several barrages of outgoing artillery in the direction of the Gaza [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=46.38s)]
*  strip, an indication that the military activity by the Israeli military will [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=51.28s)]
*  indeed continue until this pause goes into effect until those hostages are [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=55.9s)]
*  released from Gaza. So and also one clear point that the Israeli prime minister [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=63.74s)]
*  made this evening was that even as he was urging his cabinet to approve this [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=69.38s)]
*  deal, he was also making clear that the war will continue after this pause ends. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=74.06s)]
*  We also need to be clear that if you look at the past of this Israeli [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=78.7s)]
*  Palestinian conflict, typically before there is a ceasefire, before there is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=82.3s)]
*  any kind of pause in fighting, there is an uptick in military activity. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=85.86s)]
*  So we're very much here waiting and watching for that possibility. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=89.5s)]
*  But John, I do also want to tell you about a conversation I just had with [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=92.97999999999999s)]
*  Gal Hirsch, who is the Israeli prime minister's special coordinator for [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=96.14s)]
*  hostages. He just told me moments ago about this deal, about the discussions in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=100.58s)]
*  the cabinet meeting where he said that only one, only two ministers voted [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=106.06s)]
*  against this proposed deal. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=110.86s)]
*  He said that the finance minister Smotrich, who appeared to be indicating his [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=113.41999999999999s)]
*  objections to this deal, actually ended up voting in favor of it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=117.74s)]
*  And he also told me that he delivered a message just about a half hour ago to the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  families of some of these hostages, telling them that the state of Israel will [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=126.74s)]
*  do everything to bring all of the hostages back home. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=131.06s)]
*  And he really did want to emphasize that this deal for 50 hostages in exchange for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=134.78s)]
*  a four day pause in fighting, as well as three Palestinian prisoners for every [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=138.98s)]
*  civilian hostage released from Gaza, that this deal is only the first phase of [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=144.9s)]
*  these negotiations. He really wanted to emphasize that the Israeli government's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=150.02s)]
*  position is that they want to get all of the hostages back and that this military [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=154.14s)]
*  campaign, that these negotiations will not end until that happens. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=158.22s)]
*  Jeremy, I am curious. You said the official with Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=162.9s)]
*  Bernanke, who said that they had he had spoken to the families of the hostages. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=167.18s)]
*  We had the granddaughter of one hostage on about 20 minutes ago, and she said she's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=170.46s)]
*  had no communication whatsoever from the prime minister's office. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  So how is the prime minister in so far as we know reaching out? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so this is Gahlher. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=183.54s)]
*  She is the special coordinator for hostages for the prime minister. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=185.1s)]
*  He didn't say exactly how, but he said he delivered a message to the families of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=188.22s)]
*  these hostages. And what's also clear is that they don't know yet exactly [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=192.62s)]
*  which families of hostages are going to see their loved ones released. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=197.3s)]
*  He would not get into that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=201.74s)]
*  But I also think it was interesting that when he was talking about the 50 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=203.62s)]
*  individuals who will get out, he said children and their mothers. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=207.02s)]
*  We have been reporting that it would be children and women. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=210.34s)]
*  But I think it was really interesting that he was specifying that it would be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=212.7s)]
*  children and their mothers. We know, of course, of multiple cases of children who [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=216.1s)]
*  are being held hostage in Gaza and who were taken hostage with their mothers as [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=220.38s)]
*  well. And so that may give us some indication of the families that are most [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=224.58s)]
*  likely to get out in this first round of hostage releases over these four days [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  for those 50 different individuals. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=235.06s)]
*  That is perhaps an indication there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  All right, Jeremy Diamond, right on the border between Israel and Gaza, where [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=239.74s)]
*  artillery fire has continued even after the deal has been reached. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  Jeremy, thank you very much for your reporting. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=247.34s)]
*  With me now is Rami Igra, former chief of the hostages and M.I.A. unit of the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=249.46s)]
*  Mossad and retired U.S. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=253.38s)]
*  Army Major General James Spiter Marks, a CNN military analyst. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  Rami, let me start with you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=258.78s)]
*  You've been skeptical of the possibility of this deal as it was being negotiated [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=259.9s)]
*  now that they have reached a deal. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=265.58s)]
*  What are your opinions on it? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=267.54s)]
*  This deal is has been has been negotiated on the basis that the Hamas wants a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=270.98s)]
*  ceasefire. Hamas wants to be to be saved from the Israeli military. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=278.3s)]
*  On the other hand, the Israeli Israeli military is determined to eradicate the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=283.82s)]
*  Hamas. It is not something that we want to do. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=288.9s)]
*  It's something that we have to do. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=292.3s)]
*  There is no way that Israel can continue living in any form with Hamas over the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=293.9s)]
*  border. Now, this deal was reached because of Israeli public opinion and the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=299.78s)]
*  belief that the moral duty that the government has is such that it is it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=307.26s)]
*  overrides the main objective of this war. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=312.94s)]
*  And the main objective of this war is to eradicate the Hamas. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=316.18s)]
*  It is a very, very bad deal for Israel in many, many ways. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=320.38s)]
*  First of all, militarily, it's not an easy deal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=324.7s)]
*  How are they going to restart the war in four or five days? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=327.98s)]
*  Secondly, we know that the Hamas is going to play all kinds of tricks on the way, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  trying to trying to to release less less kidnapped personnel that it has. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=337.3s)]
*  And on the second hand, it is not an easy deal on the Israeli internal front. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=348.5s)]
*  Remember, there are families that their loved ones are not going to be released. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=354.38000000000005s)]
*  And there are families that have soldiers in the Gaza Strip and they know [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=359.58s)]
*  fighting in the Gaza Strip in four days time or in five days time is going to be [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=364.7s)]
*  a lot more difficult than it is right now. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=369.58s)]
*  General Mark, we've talked about this. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  What is the military impact of a multi-day pause? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=374.7s)]
*  The primary impact is that the IDF loses targetable intelligence. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=380.9s)]
*  It starts to atrophy the intelligence that they've [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=385.9s)]
*  gathered over the course of days in Gaza, begins to crumble around them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=389.14s)]
*  Because over this pause, Hamas will resupply, reposition, do everything in their power [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=395.14s)]
*  to increase their security and let there be no doubt that this is not being done [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=400.62s)]
*  by Hamas for any humanitarian reasons. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=406.58s)]
*  This is a transaction to them. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=409.5s)]
*  And I think we're at the point where the military has got a very, very tough [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  decision to make. You're in Gaza. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=415.3s)]
*  Excuse me. You're in Gaza. You're exposed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  You've got Hamas all around you still active in the tunnel network system. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=420.94s)]
*  It's not been completely taken over by the Israelis by any means. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  And so these Israeli soldiers are targets. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=429.78s)]
*  That's the challenge. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=433.26s)]
*  And then at the end of a certain amount of time, as has been described, that four [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=434.5s)]
*  days could turn into five or six days if they continue to move hostages back across [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=439.06s)]
*  into Israel. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=445.29999999999995s)]
*  That becomes a very, very tough military task. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=446.42s)]
*  The Israelis at that point are going to have to transition into a defensive [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=449.94s)]
*  posture. Pause is not a military term. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=454.74s)]
*  You attack or you defend. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=457.94s)]
*  They're going to have to start to defend. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=459.70000000000005s)]
*  That changes the mission set entirely. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=461.62s)]
*  This becomes a very, very difficult task for military commanders to execute. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=464.70000000000005s)]
*  Rami, is there anything that the Israeli military or Israeli government can do? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=469.98s)]
*  What can they do to make sure that Hamas lives up to its side of the deal? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=474.42s)]
*  Hamas is not trustworthy, as you can understand. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=480.54s)]
*  It's a terror group run by a psychopath, and they're going to do anything in their [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=483.5s)]
*  power to kill Israeli soldiers and to continue to continue regrouping and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=488.58000000000004s)]
*  restrengthening themselves as they can. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  But the Israeli army has already said, said if any breach of the agreement, even [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=498.3s)]
*  the smallest breach, it will go back into fighting full force. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=503.5s)]
*  Saying that, I don't see the Israeli military doing that if there's any more [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=508.7s)]
*  hostages to be had. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=514.34s)]
*  And this is where we are. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=516.26s)]
*  We are at a very, very difficult situation where this deal is a bad deal, but we have [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=519.54s)]
*  to go through it in order to release our people. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=526.74s)]
*  And this is our moral obligation. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=530.7s)]
*  But I mean, don't fret. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=532.94s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, difficult as it might be, at the end of the day, the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=534.86s)]
*  Israeli army will go back into fighting and Israel must achieve its goal of [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=539.46s)]
*  eradicating Hamas. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=544.6600000000001s)]
*  Rami Igro, retired General James Spider-Marx, thank you both for being with [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=546.74s)]
*  us very, very much. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwBJ_cG83ew&t=549.98s)]
