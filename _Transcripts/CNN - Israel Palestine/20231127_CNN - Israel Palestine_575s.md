# Israeli spokesperson reveals what's needed to extend Israel-Hamas truce
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk)
*  Can you tell us the details as you understand it inside the Israeli government of this extended truce? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=0.0s)]
*  So I think we have to say the following. Before we talk about extending the deal, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=9.28s)]
*  we have to implement the current deal and we're waiting for the last batch [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=14.72s)]
*  of hostages of women and children who are supposed to be released this evening. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=19.52s)]
*  And until they are safely on Israeli soil, we can't say that the four-day agreement for the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=23.92s)]
*  50 hostages has been implemented. Having said that, my Prime Minister spoke publicly last night [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=29.6s)]
*  and his remarks were reported on CNN. He said that we are open to the extension of this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=36.72s)]
*  humanitarian pause for, as your reporter said quite correctly, for every 10 hostages released, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  we're willing to give an extension of another day. And if Hamas will release Israeli hostages [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  as agreed, we will extend. That's the bottom line. So that means if it's going to be extended [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=58.4s)]
*  for two more days, and I understand what you're saying about what's going to happen today, and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=64.96s)]
*  I'll get to that in a minute, but just staying on this deal that was just announced inside Qatar [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=68.88s)]
*  and the White House is also confirming, if it is one more day of a truce for every 10 hostages, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=76.08s)]
*  if it's two days, presumably that means Hamas has agreed to 20 additional hostages after today? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=82.8s)]
*  That's correct. Once again, the parameters were set. These were negotiated with the help of [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=90.72s)]
*  President Biden, and we thank him for putting his effort and his office behind these arrangements. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=96.8s)]
*  We wouldn't have, I don't think we would have reached the deal without his input. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  And yes, it was agreed every extra day we get 10 hostages and we'll stand by that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=107.12s)]
*  Were they, so far they have only been women and children, and that was the, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  those were the parameters of this initial deal. What about the extension? Will men be included there? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=118.72s)]
*  My understanding is that there's still enough women and children in Gaza held by Hamas [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=125.84s)]
*  that can fill that for the next 20. Hamas is responsible for all the hostages. They are, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=133.04s)]
*  unfortunately, but they are the government there in Gaza. They control the situation on the ground. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  The cessation of fighting has given them the opportunity to, you know, to find every last [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=145.76s)]
*  hostage, and we're expecting tonight to see the final group of women and children, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=152.88s)]
*  and hopefully in the coming days we'll see more. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=158.96s)]
*  Can you just expand on what you just said and how you started in this interview talking about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=164.88s)]
*  the current situation? What is the holdup? You said that there is a holdup. What is the sticking [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=171.36s)]
*  point when it comes to the group of women and children expected to be released today? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=176.72s)]
*  As you know, this is the fourth and final release in the framework of the four days, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=181.92s)]
*  but as you know, I think it was only last night that they actually got out on time. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=191.11999999999998s)]
*  On the first day and the second day there were delays, there were last-minute crises, there were [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  all sorts of problems, and the truth is we have to remember who we're dealing with. We're dealing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=199.6s)]
*  with a ruthless, fanatical terrorist organization, Hamas, and it's always like pulling teeth. I mean, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=203.92s)]
*  it's difficult. It's never easy, and that's why I urge, let's wait to see what happens tonight [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=210.4s)]
*  that we see our people, the released hostages, safely on Israeli soil. I mean, last night [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=217.68s)]
*  we had 13 Israeli women and children released. The youngest was that four-year-old American Israeli, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=225.12s)]
*  Abigail Idan, right? She was kidnapped when she was three, so you have to ask what sort of people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=231.28s)]
*  kidnap three-year-olds, right? And I think that tells you everything you need to know about Hamas [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=238.16s)]
*  and explains why it's so difficult. These people are ruthless, and if they think there's an advantage [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=243.2s)]
*  in them for perpetuating the suffering of these innocent civilians and their families in Israel, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=250.56s)]
*  they will do so if they think it's in their interest. Well, she was three, and her parents [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=256.24s)]
*  were also, according to President Biden, murdered brutally right in front of her on October 7th, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  so I completely take your point. Having said that, they are the organization that you have to deal [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  with because they are the ones who have these women and children. So given that reality, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=275.6s)]
*  that unfortunate reality that you are dealing with, what is the status, as far as you know, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=282.16s)]
*  of those who are supposed to come out today? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  So once again, we have received some good signals, but until they are on Israeli soil, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=291.28s)]
*  it's not done. We can't celebrate. And it's the same for the families who have been waiting for [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=300.0s)]
*  these people for over 50 days now. Once again, once they are on Israeli soil, we can say it has [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=305.67999999999995s)]
*  been done. But we've got to be cautious. With Hamas, you've got to be cautious. You need nerves [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=312.96s)]
*  of steel when you're dealing with these sort of people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=319.36s)]
*  Mark, I want to ask about one of the sticking points over the weekend, which was that there was [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=322.24s)]
*  a child released without her mother, the Rotem family. Hila was released and her mother was not. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  Raya, what is your understanding at this point of why that is, particularly now since you have been [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=338.32s)]
*  able to, officials in your government have been able to speak with the daughter about the last [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=344.88s)]
*  time she saw her mother. Can you give any more information about that? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=351.12s)]
*  I can only say the following, Dana. To release a young child without a parent, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=357.28s)]
*  that is the most inhumane thing. To release a daughter and for the mother to stay in captivity, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=366.4s)]
*  once again, that is another manifestation of what we're dealing with. These people are heartless. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=372.64s)]
*  These people are depraved. These people lack any sense of common decency, and that is our enemy. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=380.0s)]
*  When the fight against Hamas is resumed, I want people to remember that Israel is fighting a [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=388.0s)]
*  ruthless and despicable terrorist organization. When we defeat them, as we will, that won't just [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=395.52s)]
*  be good for Israel. Our people deserve to live in safety and in security, yes, not to fear terrorists [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=401.52s)]
*  crossing the border in the middle of the night and butchering their children. But the people of Gaza [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  also deserve better. Hamas has been ruling Gaza for 16 years, and what have they bought the people [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=412.96s)]
*  of Gaza? Just suffering and pain and poverty. Everyone in this region will be better off without Hamas. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=417.84s)]
*  Just, if I may, you described the unfortunate human situation here, terrible human, barbaric [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=426.4s)]
*  human situation. But what about the why? Are you concerned that her mother and others have been [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  separated from Hamas and are now in captivity by other groups inside Gaza? Look, from Israel's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=443.68s)]
*  perspective, Hamas can't subcontract out any responsibility. They are responsible, and the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=452.96s)]
*  reason for the pause was not to give any excuses because, you know, if they were, if Israel continued [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=459.84s)]
*  attacking, they could say, well, we couldn't get out of our bunker to find the hostages. They've had [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=465.44s)]
*  now four days of pause. They're the guys that control the Gaza Strip. Unfortunately, I wish [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=469.52s)]
*  it wasn't the case. It soon won't be the case, but at the moment they're in charge and they are [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=475.2s)]
*  responsible for all the hostages. Mark Regev, thank you for your time. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=479.84s)]
*  And, Wolf, I want to bring you back in now. Your reaction, knowing not only Mark Regev, but knowing [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=489.44s)]
*  the situation as well as you do to the news there. I mean, I will say, obviously, he confirmed this [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  deal, but at the end he talked about when the military operation resumes, not if, when. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=501.84s)]
*  Well, the Israeli Defense Ministry, the Israeli, the IDF, the Israeli political leadership, the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=510.47999999999996s)]
*  war cabinet, they are all basically on the same page saying that after they obviously want to get [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=515.68s)]
*  all the Israeli hostages, all the hostages out of Gaza in back to Israel. That's obviously a top [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=522.16s)]
*  priority, if not the top priority, but they're also saying that even after that they're going to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  continue their struggle against Hamas. They don't want Hamas to be in charge of Gaza because they [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=534.64s)]
*  fear that what happened on October 7th could happen again. So they're going to continue to go after [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=540.16s)]
*  Hamas and resume their military activity, whether airstrikes or ground assault. They're making it [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  abundantly clear that is not going to stop. It's stopping as long as this temporary truce, and they [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=551.28s)]
*  call it a truce, a pause. They're not calling it a ceasefire. As long as this is going on, they're [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=556.56s)]
*  going to pause in the Israeli military action against Hamas, but they are making it abundantly [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=562.16s)]
*  clear that is not going to pause forever. They're going to go after Hamas, and that's going to be [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=569.12s)]
*  very significant. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ucI0Zl1mpk&t=573.4399999999999s)]
