# CNN investigates Israeli strikes in ‘lethal range’ of Lebanese hospitals
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to)
*  We turn now to the war in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=0.0s)]
*  Lebanon has been forced to shut down a third [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=2.44s)]
*  of its healthcare facilities, the WHO says, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=5.24s)]
*  as Israel continues bombing the country [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  as it says it's targeting Hezbollah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=11.48s)]
*  The Lebanese prime minister says [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=13.76s)]
*  an unprecedented humanitarian crisis is unfolding. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Last week, a deadly Israeli strike hit [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=19.02s)]
*  near Beirut's largest public hospital, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=21.7s)]
*  killing 18 people and severely damaging that building. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=24.6s)]
*  But the IDF insists that it struck a quote, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=28.1s)]
*  Hezbollah terrorist target. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=30.44s)]
*  It's a similar scenario to what's unfolded in Gaza [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=32.42s)]
*  in Israel's war against Hamas, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=35.18s)]
*  where no target appears off limits, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  including medical facilities. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=38.92s)]
*  CNN's Tamara Kiblawi has this investigation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=40.82s)]
*  A ball of fire lights up the night sky. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=45.72s)]
*  Seconds later, loud booms reverberate [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=48.66s)]
*  through Lebanon's capital. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=52.36s)]
*  One of many explosions rocking Beirut's southern suburbs [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=54.1s)]
*  nearly every night for the past month. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=58.1s)]
*  In Lebanon's largest public hospital, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=59.78s)]
*  glass shatters and there's panic [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=64.18s)]
*  as an Israeli bomb hits the vicinity. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=66.18s)]
*  ER nurse, Mohamed Fouani, was there [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=68.78s)]
*  when that explosion came without warning. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=70.82s)]
*  In the day, the horrors come to light. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=88.5s)]
*  Meters away from the hospital, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=92.74000000000001s)]
*  the epicenter of the Israeli strike. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  A desperate scramble to dig men, women, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=97.94000000000001s)]
*  and children out of the rubble. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  This is Hezbollah's seat of power, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  a major flashpoint in Israel's bombing campaign. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=105.38000000000001s)]
*  But this is also home to some one million people, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  most of whom are now displaced. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  Israeli strikes across the country [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=117.78s)]
*  have damaged 34 hospitals according to health authorities. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  Eight of these have been forced to close. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  Now, while the majority of these hospitals [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=126.06s)]
*  weren't directly hit, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=128.26s)]
*  they were inside a blast radius known as a kill zone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=129.66s)]
*  Let's look at this more closely. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=134.54s)]
*  The bombing campaign focused on three areas, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=136.78s)]
*  the southern suburbs of Beirut, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=139.98s)]
*  the Bukhar Valley, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=142.34s)]
*  and the country south which borders Israel. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  We analyzed over 240 Israeli airstrikes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=147.34s)]
*  in the first month of Israel's countrywide offensive. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=150.22s)]
*  Our team measured the potential reach of fragments [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=154.82000000000002s)]
*  from each one of these attacks. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  Experts call this a kill zone, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=159.56s)]
*  a 340 meter radius around the target [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=162.0s)]
*  where shrapnel can tear through buildings and people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=164.5s)]
*  This calculation is based on the types of bombs [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=168.56s)]
*  we know Israel is using in Lebanon today. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  In the southern suburbs of Beirut, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=174.10000000000002s)]
*  our analysis found that every single hospital [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  was within the kill zone of an airstrike. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  And health authorities say every single hospital [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=181.12s)]
*  has been damaged as a result. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  In the Bukhar Valley, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=187.08s)]
*  two hospitals were found within these kill zones. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=188.36s)]
*  In the south, where whole villages have been flattened [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  by Israel's bombardment, there were six. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=194.9s)]
*  CNN was able to verify 19 hospitals [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=198.94s)]
*  that fell within these kill zones. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  Health authorities say a fifth of Lebanon's hospitals [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=204.52s)]
*  have been damaged. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=207.6s)]
*  Many fear this is only the beginning [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=210.46s)]
*  with dozens of Lebanese health and emergency workers [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=212.56s)]
*  killed in just a month, according to the health ministry. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=215.12s)]
*  There are echoes of the apocalyptic situation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=218.5s)]
*  that is still playing out for hospitals in Gaza. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=221.1s)]
*  Dr. Tha'ed Ahmed is an American doctor [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=225.38s)]
*  who was working in Gaza earlier this year. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  He's in Lebanon now, and he says he's getting flashbacks. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=230.34s)]
*  There are no red lines. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=233.34s)]
*  There is no respect for international humanitarian law. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=234.36s)]
*  We saw that in Gaza for the past 13 months, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  and we're seeing it in Lebanon. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=240.86s)]
*  Are we heading in that same direction? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=242.86s)]
*  Are we actually going to see this repeat itself? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  Responding to CNN's findings, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=247.36s)]
*  the Israeli military said it operates [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=249.38000000000002s)]
*  in strict accordance with international law. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=251.06s)]
*  It accused Hezbollah of being deeply embedded [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=253.96s)]
*  in civilian areas, deliberately close to medical facilities. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=256.38s)]
*  Lebanon is no stranger to war, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=261.26s)]
*  but its health workers say they've never been more vulnerable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  And yet, they say, they feel they have no choice [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=266.94s)]
*  but to carry on. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcDElSBE3to&t=270.42s)]
