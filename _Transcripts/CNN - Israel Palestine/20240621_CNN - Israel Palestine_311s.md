# Ex-US Defense Secy. under Trump explains the message Hezbollah is sending Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck)
*  Fears are growing about a potential full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah militants [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=0.0s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Right now, Israel and Hezbollah are trading increasingly intense threats. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  The latest from the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, who says if a war breaks out, the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=12.08s)]
*  group will target Cyprus, the nearby island nation that is a member of the European Union. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=17.6s)]
*  Earlier, Israel warned the possibility of war is getting very close after Hezbollah [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=23.36s)]
*  released this threatening drone video purporting to show sensitive Israeli military as well [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=28.24s)]
*  as civilian sites. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=33.96s)]
*  Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been rising ever since the October 7 attacks [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=35.64s)]
*  by Hamas, but especially here in recent weeks. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=39.76s)]
*  We have former defense secretary from the Trump administration, Mark Esper, with us [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=42.64s)]
*  now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=46.36s)]
*  He also serves on the board or as a strategic adviser for several aerospace and defense-related [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=47.36s)]
*  companies. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  Sir, we see this, Hezbollah drones, the message loud and clear, but these drones have also [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  been rather effective at evading Israeli air defense, hitting Israeli military sites, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=58.0s)]
*  even civilian homes in northern Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=62.64s)]
*  And U.S. officials, we've learned, are worried that Israeli systems, including Iron Dome, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=64.88s)]
*  will not be able to keep up. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=69.92s)]
*  How concerned are you about this? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=71.24s)]
*  Sure, Brianna. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=73.44s)]
*  Look, we should be concerned, and this has been a concern now since the beginning of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=75.4s)]
*  the conflict in Gaza. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=80.64s)]
*  Hezbollah has been shooting rockets and drones into Israel from the north nearly every day. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=83.6s)]
*  And at this point, they've caused a handful of Israelis to be killed, but they also have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=89.36s)]
*  displaced well over 60,000 to 80,000 Israelis from northern Israel. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=95.28s)]
*  So they've been displaced for some time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=99.72s)]
*  I am very concerned about this because we're now seeing a real escalation in terms of the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  rhetoric. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  I think what Hezbollah did with regard to sending that drone over Israel, over the port [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  of Haifa, was a clear threat, a warning that we can see you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=112.0s)]
*  And if we can see you, we can shoot you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=115.91999999999999s)]
*  And that's important because we know that Hezbollah has an inventory of well over 150,000 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  rockets and missiles, which could do quite a lot of damage to all parts of Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=123.72s)]
*  What would a two-front war mean in this conflict, and also specifically for the U.S., as Israel's [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=129.04s)]
*  main patron? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=134.92s)]
*  Well, fighting across two fronts is hard because, of course, it draws resources, one from each. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=137.92s)]
*  And maybe the Israeli view is that they are wrapping up operations in Gaza so that they can turn to Hezbollah now in the north. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=143.56s)]
*  They've been talking about this, hinting about this for some time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=154.2s)]
*  There are parts of the Israeli government that have wanted to stir things up with Hezbollah in the north. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  And maybe they're reaching this point right now. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  I think for the United States, look, we're trying to get the Middle East to simmer down and not expand. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=164.92s)]
*  And yet this would be quite an expansion. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  Keep in mind that Hamas, while it had an estimated 30,000 or so fighters in a small swath of territory, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=172.76s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has claimed to have over 100,000 fighters. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  And so you could see a much broader conflict. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=184.8s)]
*  And then on top of this, we've got to keep in mind strategically, geopolitically, Iran is in the midst of a leadership transition. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=186.76s)]
*  And we should know by the end of this month who the next president of Iran is and what direction will he take the country, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=193.16s)]
*  particularly with regard to this conflict in the Middle East? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=198.96s)]
*  I wonder what you make of the fighting between Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  because the IDF spokesperson, Daniel Higari, said those who think Israel can make Hamas disappear are wrong. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=207.32s)]
*  I mean, paging Benjamin Netanyahu loud and clear here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=214.24s)]
*  He's been very critical of the IDF lately in his office pushback on that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=217.68s)]
*  Who's right here? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=222.76s)]
*  Well, the IDF spokesman was right. He's correct. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=226.12s)]
*  I mean, we've all been saying for some time you cannot destroy Hamas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=228.16s)]
*  It's it's an ideology, a theology. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  It's a it's a cult. Right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=234.32s)]
*  Now, what you can do is you can neutralize its leadership, which I've argued and others have. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=236.56s)]
*  You can you can decimate the ranks of its fighters to make sure that they're no longer combat ineffective. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=240.12s)]
*  But in terms of completely destroying and eradicating them is not possible. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=245.44s)]
*  What you'd have to do is, again, take take out the leadership, remove their warfighting capability, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=249.12s)]
*  and then you have to have a police or security presence on the ground to continue to kind of, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  as we say, keep mowing the lawn every now and then to make sure that the right fighters don't rise up. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=258.68s)]
*  So, look, I think the spokesman was right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=263.08000000000004s)]
*  You see this growing split between the IDF and the political leadership, which is quite curious. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  We saw when Benny Gantz left the government a couple of weeks ago, Gantz, of course, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=271.8s)]
*  was an opposition political leader and a former head of the IDF military. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=276.04s)]
*  And I think lastly, Brianna, we saw just the other day over the weekend, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  it seemed to catch the surprise of Netanyahu that the IDF called for a tactical pause in operations in in Gaza [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=284.04s)]
*  to allow for the humanitarian aid to get through. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  And that really caught the government off guard. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  And it was others in the government have objected. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=297.04s)]
*  So we see a growing rift now between the military and its political leaders. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=299.04s)]
*  Yeah, he seemed surprised and also pretty ticked off by it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=303.64s)]
*  It was very clear. Secretary Esper, we always appreciate you being on. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=306.64s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1OkO6TW3Ck&t=310.08s)]
