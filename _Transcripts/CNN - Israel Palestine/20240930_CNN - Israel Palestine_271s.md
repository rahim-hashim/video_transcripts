# CNN aboard Israeli tanker for strike on Houthi-controlled port in Yemen
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw)
*  I'm joined now by CNN's Nick Robertson, who went on a flight today with the Israeli military, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=0.0s)]
*  the Israeli Air Force, I should say, to Yemen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=5.84s)]
*  Tell us what you saw. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=8.52s)]
*  Yeah, this was an IDF embed, allowed to be there, not allowed to take a camera with us, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=9.52s)]
*  so did not have our own video footage on board this aircraft. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=15.32s)]
*  But what we were able to see was how they are operating on these long-range missions. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=19.52s)]
*  This mission today to strike Hudaydah involved a number of air-to-air refueling aircraft, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=26.64s)]
*  and that's what we were on board one of, and topping up the F-35 fighter jets all the way [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=33.92s)]
*  as they were en route, flying on their path towards Hudaydah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=40.24s)]
*  And it's a vision into the difference between striking Yemen and striking Lebanon, because [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=45.0s)]
*  Israeli warplanes construct Lebanon in a flight that lasts minutes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=51.2s)]
*  Lebanon is a much longer flight of hundreds of miles that requires that refueling, and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=56.48s)]
*  therefore is a much more elaborate operation, I imagine. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=59.8s)]
*  Much more elaborate, much more sophisticated, 1,200 miles. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=63.08s)]
*  This, by the way, I was told, was the second longest mission that the Israeli Air Force [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=66.16s)]
*  has ever conducted like this since 1985, when they struck targets in Libya. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=72.72s)]
*  Now, of course, they fly these aircraft at further distances, but this was the longest [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=77.6s)]
*  combat mission that they've been on. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=83.44s)]
*  And what the message was here, other than what they targeted on the ground there, the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  power station, the other Houthi-controlled facilities in the port city of Hudaydah, was [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  to show exactly what the Prime Minister has been saying, that the enemies that strike [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=95.36s)]
*  out and hit Israel, we can reach you wherever you are. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  That was the message. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=104.4s)]
*  That was the message of how they have the ability to use these fuel tankers to get their [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=105.58s)]
*  fighter jets on station. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=110.52s)]
*  The reason they did it now was because just yesterday, the Houthis fired another ballistic [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=112.4s)]
*  missile at the center of Israel, and they claimed that they'd fired it at Bangurian [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=118.44000000000001s)]
*  Airport when the Prime Minister was just landing on the tarmac. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=122.88000000000001s)]
*  That's quite a message of its own. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=126.68s)]
*  I wonder, is that message about the range of Israeli Air Force operations not just intended [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=127.68s)]
*  for the Houthis in Yemen, but also for Iran? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=135.6s)]
*  It's exactly what I was told. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=139.06s)]
*  Not just for the Houthis, but for Iran. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=141.56s)]
*  For Iran to see that Israel is willing and ready and able to reach out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=142.84s)]
*  And of course, what the IDF explained and say is that the Houthis are only able to launch [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=147.4s)]
*  these missiles because they are being brought in by the Iranians, because they're Iranian-backed, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  and the place that they're bringing them in, or one of the places they bring them in, is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  the port city of Hudaydah, which is one of the reasons why they were targeting the Houthi-controlled [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  part of it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=165.36s)]
*  I asked them, what do you do about civilians? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=166.36s)]
*  And they said that's part of the sophistication of this mission, is you time it right to the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=169.84s)]
*  minute, to the second even, to try to reduce the possibility of civilian casualties on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  the ground. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=182.4s)]
*  They say you cannot always mitigate against that, but they take precautions. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=183.4s)]
*  They told me, if they see civilians there, or if they see, for example, shipping close [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  by to where they're targeting, they say that they wouldn't strike. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  So it's a very important question, I think, to be asking the IDF at the moment about civilian [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=201.24s)]
*  casualties, because the high casualty toll in Gaza, the high casualty toll that we're [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=206.68s)]
*  seeing inside of Lebanon. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  A whole new bar has been set for civilian casualties, and we see, for instance, in Israeli [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  airstrikes in Lebanon that there are times when certain precautions are taken and times [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  when they're not. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=224.36s)]
*  There were warnings that went out prior to Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=225.44000000000003s)]
*  Of course, there was no warning prior to the strike that ended up killing Nasrallah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=228.8s)]
*  I imagine in that point secrecy outweighed the risk of civilian deaths. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  And that is something that was explained to me, that there are targets like that where [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=239.52s)]
*  they would describe it as the golden information. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=246.52s)]
*  The information comes in that he's, that high value target is in that place. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=249.68s)]
*  It's a whole different calculation. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=254.44s)]
*  A situation like Yemen today, I was told that if there had been a very high risk of civilian [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=255.8s)]
*  or other casualties there, they would have pulled back. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=264.72s)]
*  Nick Robertson, fascinating access. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=268.24s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dzF-pNROEw&t=269.8s)]
