*  mobilizations in the history of Israel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=27.939999999999998s)]
*  At a military base in southern Israel columns of Israeli Merkava for tanks stand at the ready [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=31.38s)]
*  Awaiting orders for an invasion of Gaza that everyone expects, but no one has yet commanded [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=38.22s)]
*  This is a country on a war footing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=45.82s)]
*  The Israeli military has called up more than 300,000 reservists. It is one of the largest [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  Mobilization efforts in this country's history and this right here behind me is that mobilization effort in action [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=55.66s)]
*  You are witnessing thousands of reservists Israelis from all across the country [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=62.74s)]
*  Coming to this military base in southern Israel to begin to prepare for the next phase of this military campaign [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=67.66s)]
*  But it's not just the scale that makes this mobilization different. I've been in all the campaigns [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=74.94s)]
*  in the last 30 years [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=81.62s)]
*  Never like never something like this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=84.18s)]
*  For the soldiers converging on this base the shocking brutality of Hamas's surprise terrorist attacks is still reverberating [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=86.74000000000001s)]
*  every person [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  There's no someone [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  Every person been in Amsterdam till till Wednesday morning till it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=101.18s)]
*  Monday morning. I came here, you know to enlist to the army to fight those best things. It's a very emotional moment [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  Yes, when you see children die and keep nothing it's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=114.14s)]
*  It's like an animal it's not [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=120.34s)]
*  Driving down roads east of the Gaza Strip [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=123.7s)]
*  Preparations for the next phase of Israel's military campaign are everywhere [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=126.78s)]
*  trucks loaded with ammunition [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=131.98000000000002s)]
*  armored vehicles [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=134.58s)]
*  thousands of Israeli soldiers [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  Mobilizing and just seven miles from the Gaza border this formation of armored personnel carriers [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=138.26s)]
*  We are about a dozen kilometers from the Gaza border about six or seven miles and what we are seeing here are the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=144.34s)]
*  Preparations for what many people in Israel believe is going to happen next and that is the possibility of a ground invasion [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=151.29999999999998s)]
*  You can see here [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=157.89999999999998s)]
*  Armored personnel carriers perhaps nearly two dozen of those as well as trucks and you see soldiers all here [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=159.62s)]
*  Preparing for the next phase of this war but amid the preparations for tomorrow's battle [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=168.22s)]
*  Today's is still very much alive [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=175.42s)]
*  And [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=180.66s)]
*  Jake just to put that number of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=181.94s)]
*  300,000 reservists being called up into context that is four percent of Israel's population [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  But perhaps what is more startling is that that number is nearly equal to the number of total? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=190.1s)]
*  Forces in the US's military reserves that number is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=195.7s)]
*  331,000 and when you consider the fact that the US population is 34 times larger [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=200.85999999999999s)]
*  It really helps you understand the scale of this mobilization effort here in Israel now the question is what happens next? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=205.7s)]
*  We simply do not know yet [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=212.54s)]
*  But all of the soldiers we spoke to today all of those reservists [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  They all seem to believe that they are likely going into Gaza [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=217.88s)]
*  But so far the Israeli Prime Minister and his new emergency government have yet to actually announce or make that decision [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeuvIUopgGg&t=221.38s)]
