# Video shows rocket strike about 100 meters from CNN reporter
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI)
*  Israel ramping up its bombardment of Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=0.0s)]
*  And tonight, acknowledging it was behind a deadly blast [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=3.14s)]
*  outside the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=6.68s)]
*  Now I wanna warn you, the images we're gonna show you, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=9.64s)]
*  they are graphic as they've been coming in. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=11.76s)]
*  According to multiple videos that CNN has geo-located, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=13.56s)]
*  you can see through here, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=17.42s)]
*  bloodied bodies just strewn across the ground [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=19.46s)]
*  near an ambulance. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=21.66s)]
*  A spokesman for the Hamas-run health ministry [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  claims authorities had organized a medical convoy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=25.8s)]
*  from the hospital to the Rafah Crossing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=28.779999999999998s)]
*  That spokesperson says that the ambulances, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=31.34s)]
*  when the ambulances started to move south, they were hit. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  And a director of the hospital tells Al Jazeera this, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=37.92s)]
*  medical teams and paramedics lost their lives. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=42.16s)]
*  Regrettably, some of the wounded lost their lives. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=45.16s)]
*  Tonight, the International Committee of the Red Cross [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=49.16s)]
*  confirms it was aware of a convoy [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  that would be carrying patients [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=53.8s)]
*  from northern Gaza to the south. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=55.2s)]
*  But according to the Israeli military, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=57.22s)]
*  it struck an ambulance that was being used by Hamas. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=59.72s)]
*  Here's the quote from the IDF. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=63.66s)]
*  An IDF aircraft struck an ambulance [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=65.36s)]
*  that was identified by forces [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=69.44s)]
*  in close proximity to their position in the battle zone. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=71.97999999999999s)]
*  A number of Hamas terrorist operatives [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=75.0s)]
*  were killed in the strike. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=77.12s)]
*  However, it also appears civilians [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  were also killed and injured. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  And that is why today, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  Secretary of State Tony Blinken, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=85.5s)]
*  on his third trip to Israel [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=87.08s)]
*  since the October 7th Hamas terror attack, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=88.84s)]
*  pressed Israel's leaders to do more [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=91.28s)]
*  to protect civilians in Gaza [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=93.62s)]
*  and allow more humanitarian aid [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  to enter the 25-mile-long strip. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=97.48s)]
*  That public request was rebuffed by Israel's prime minister, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=100.42s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, saying Israel objects [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=104.4s)]
*  to any temporary ceasefire [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=106.66s)]
*  unless Hamas frees all 241 hostages. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=108.36s)]
*  So that means more strikes in Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=114.28s)]
*  And tonight, we have another dispatch [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=116.46s)]
*  from an aid worker, Mahmoud Shalabi. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=118.42s)]
*  He's been sending updates to Outfront from northern Gaza, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=120.62s)]
*  the focus on the Israeli offensive. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=123.8s)]
*  Tonight, Shalabi describes what he witnessed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=127.34s)]
*  after a blast near his home. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=130.3s)]
*  Men, fathers, carrying their daughters and their children [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=133.9s)]
*  and crying like babies. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=137.78s)]
*  And I saw one child, one child who's about 12 years old [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=140.64s)]
*  who was saying, I did nothing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  I did nothing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=150.14s)]
*  Civilians saying the very same thing [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=151.2s)]
*  on both sides of the Israel-Hamas war now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond is out front, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=157.57999999999998s)]
*  live along the Israel-Gaza border for us. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=158.73999999999998s)]
*  Melissa Bell is in Cairo, Egypt. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  I wanna start with Jeremy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=162.77999999999997s)]
*  Jeremy, what more are you hearing about this strike [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=163.77999999999997s)]
*  on an ambulance in Gaza City? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=166.82s)]
*  Well, Kay, first of all, I mean, you saw those images, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=171.5s)]
*  scenes of absolute devastation outside Al-Shifa Hospital [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=174.16s)]
*  where this convoy of ambulances [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  was apparently heading south. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=179.5s)]
*  Palestinian health authorities say [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=181.54s)]
*  that this convoy of ambulances [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=183.44s)]
*  was carrying wounded individuals [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  who were heading to the Rafah crossing with Egypt [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=186.77999999999997s)]
*  in order to get those wounded individuals evacuated. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=189.42s)]
*  As we have seen over the last several days, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=192.61999999999998s)]
*  some wounded have been allowed to leave into Egypt. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  But Israel paints a very different picture here, Kay. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=197.22s)]
*  They say that these ambulances [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=200.34s)]
*  were being used by Hamas operatives [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=202.88s)]
*  and that it targeted those ambulances for that reason, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=205.28s)]
*  saying that it killed several Hamas militants in this strike. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=208.18s)]
*  Israel also points out that it believes [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=212.12s)]
*  that Hamas has used ambulances in the past [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=214.22s)]
*  to transport not only Hamas militants [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=216.62s)]
*  but also some of its weaponry. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=218.4s)]
*  CNN cannot, of course, independently verify those claims, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=220.72s)]
*  and Israel so far has not provided any evidence for that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=223.56s)]
*  But what we do know, Kay, is the toll of casualties here. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=226.56s)]
*  According to the Hamas-run Palestinian Ministry of Health, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=230.3s)]
*  15 people were killed in this strike, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=233.24s)]
*  50 others were wounded. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=235.34s)]
*  The Palestinian Ministry of Health, again, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=237.74s)]
*  says that injured people were being carried [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=239.74s)]
*  in these ambulances. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=241.68s)]
*  It also says that it requested the International Red Cross [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=243.18s)]
*  to accompany the convoy, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=247.18s)]
*  the Red Cross confirming that it received that request, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=248.76s)]
*  but says that it did not take part in this convoy. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=251.02s)]
*  Nonetheless, this is raising more questions [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=254.3s)]
*  about Israel's tactics in this war. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=256.22s)]
*  Following the strikes earlier this week [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=258.38s)]
*  in the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=260.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, Kate, Hamas is continuing to target [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=263.32s)]
*  Israeli towns and cities, targeting population centers, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=265.62s)]
*  civilian targets in Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=269.12s)]
*  Earlier today, Kate, our team was very close [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=272.16s)]
*  to one of those strikes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=275.1s)]
*  A rocket came in about 100 meters away [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  from where a number of journalists, including my team, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=278.86s)]
*  was positioned in Sderot. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  And I want to show you this video, Kate, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=284.74s)]
*  shot by my photojournalist, Matias Sum. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=286.76s)]
*  You can hear the power of that rocket coming in, listen. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=288.56s)]
*  And Kate, following that strike, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=304.0s)]
*  we were actually able to see the crater [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=306.68s)]
*  where that rocket made impact, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=308.52s)]
*  it damaged several vehicles, it actually landed, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=310.04s)]
*  at least one of those two rockets landed [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=312.42s)]
*  in the courtyard of a kindergarten. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=314.42s)]
*  So we're no children, of course, there at the time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  School has been closed in Sderot for the time being. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=319.74s)]
*  But obviously, as you know, Kate, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=323.54s)]
*  the Iron Dome missile defense system [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=325.54s)]
*  takes out the overwhelming majority of these rockets, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=327.08000000000004s)]
*  but it does not take them all out, Kate. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=329.64000000000004s)]
*  Jeremy, thank you so much, Jeremy Diamond, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=332.22s)]
*  and Israel for us. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=334.42s)]
*  Out front with me now, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrykus, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=335.58000000000004s)]
*  he's the international spokesman for the IDF. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=338.66s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  What more can you tell us about the strikes on the ambulance? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  When you're a hospital. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=346.56s)]
*  Hi, thank you for having me. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=349.4s)]
*  There's fighting ongoing. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=351.7s)]
*  We are at war against Hamas in Northern Gaza [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=353.1s)]
*  and all over Gaza, but focusing on the Northern Gaza Strip. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=355.74s)]
*  Our forces saw terrorists using ambulances [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=359.74s)]
*  as a vehicle to move around. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=363.44s)]
*  They perceived a threat, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=366.06s)]
*  and accordingly, we struck that ambulance. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=367.28s)]
*  I must say that this is not the first [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=370.56s)]
*  and not the hundredth time that Hamas operatives, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=372.66s)]
*  including senior leaders, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=375.7s)]
*  make use, illegal use, of ambulances on the battlefield. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=377.2s)]
*  They use them as their taxis [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=380.84s)]
*  in order to get from one place to another, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=382.4s)]
*  specifically seniors, and it is not the first time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=384.14s)]
*  They did it in 2014. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=387.32s)]
*  They're doing it again, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=388.92s)]
*  and we are well within our legal rights [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=390.38s)]
*  according to the laws of armed conflict [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  once they use it, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=394.56s)]
*  and we perceive it as a threat to attack it. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=395.62s)]
*  In that strike, who was taken out? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=399.91999999999996s)]
*  Were they high-level operatives within Hamas? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you have the names of who was taken out [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  or who was being targeted? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  No, this wasn't a targeted killing of someone. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=411.48s)]
*  This was during combat. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  Our troops saw that they were using the ambulance [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=415.54s)]
*  and trying to either escape or attack using that, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=418.78000000000003s)]
*  and that is why they were struck. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=422.62s)]
*  Hopefully, we'll be able to provide intelligence [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=424.38s)]
*  and more footage and information about it, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=426.58000000000004s)]
*  but we have other information [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=429.22s)]
*  which we are also able to show and have shared [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=431.68s)]
*  with CNN and others of how ambulances have been seen, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=433.68s)]
*  and we have caught it on camera. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  Ambulances have been seen in Hamas locations, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  Hamas camps, where they are next to the locations [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  of the headquarters, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=448.14000000000004s)]
*  and they are used not to transport wounded, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  but in order to get senior and other commanders [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  from one place to another without the risk [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=455.82000000000005s)]
*  of being followed or attacked by the IDF. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=458.38s)]
*  The numbers from the Hamas-run Ministry of Health [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=461.24s)]
*  coming out are 15 killed and I think it was 50 wounded. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=463.74s)]
*  There's no distinction in those numbers of who was civilian [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=468.66s)]
*  and who was connected with Hamas. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=472.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=476.26000000000005s)]
*  A combatant or a terrorist, yes. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=477.20000000000005s)]
*  It's okay to say those words. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=479.46000000000004s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=481.36s)]
*  I know. I see a lot of pictures of young men. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=483.70000000000005s)]
*  I don't see weapons. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=486.6s)]
*  I don't know if the Hamas Navy there were conveniently hidden [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=487.62s)]
*  before TV crews came there for this whole orchestrated event, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=491.02000000000004s)]
*  but bottom line, we know that there were Hamas operatives there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=495.5s)]
*  I don't have the finite number, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=499.44s)]
*  but I am certain that there were Hamas activist terrorists [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=501.04s)]
*  there who were trying to use an ambulance [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=504.3s)]
*  in order to facilitate their movement [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=506.20000000000005s)]
*  while fighting was ongoing. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=508.38s)]
*  Colonel, earlier today, I spoke with an American politician [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=510.28000000000003s)]
*  who supports Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=515.1600000000001s)]
*  He's also on the Armed Services Committee [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=519.0400000000001s)]
*  and he says that the bombing of innocent civilians [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=520.84s)]
*  needs to stop and the way he said it is today, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=524.64s)]
*  and here's what he said to me. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=527.24s)]
*  He said, I don't think if you're using hundreds of civilians [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=528.44s)]
*  as a human shield, meaning Hamas, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  and you have one terrorist, that that justifies a bombing. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=535.0200000000001s)]
*  Why not go about this in a more surgical way? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=541.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that that is ever, ever the case, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=545.4000000000001s)]
*  one for a hundred. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=548.36s)]
*  That doesn't seem logical for me at all, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=550.24s)]
*  and that doesn't at all compute with the calculations [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=553.7800000000001s)]
*  that I am aware of that the IDF does. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=557.44s)]
*  It would have to be Yichia Sinwar and Mohammad Def together [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=559.58s)]
*  to warrant that kind of collateral damage. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=564.72s)]
*  That is not the case. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=567.72s)]
*  The sad reality is that we have asked civilians to evacuate, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=569.0600000000001s)]
*  including in the pictures that you're showing [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=572.4200000000001s)]
*  from different areas in Gaza, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=574.58s)]
*  we have asked them to evacuate [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=577.38s)]
*  because we know that Hamas is trying to use them [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=578.82s)]
*  as their human shields. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=581.4200000000001s)]
*  We know that it will be dangerous, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=582.5s)]
*  and we have told them this isn't a safe place to be, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=584.1800000000001s)]
*  go south. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=586.86s)]
*  Those that have stayed have done it at their own agency, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=587.86s)]
*  which is regrettable. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=591.82s)]
*  I'm sure that some have been forced to stay by Hamas, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=593.0s)]
*  which is appalling and a war crime, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=595.74s)]
*  preventing civilians to flee to safety by Hamas [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=598.26s)]
*  is an active war crime, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=601.9s)]
*  which they should be criticized and called out for doing. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=603.34s)]
*  And I don't think that the focus should be [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=606.34s)]
*  on what Israel is doing in order to defend ourselves. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqpU_UKN3TI&t=608.22s)]
