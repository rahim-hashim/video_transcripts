# Military analyst: Explosions may represent beginning of troop movement into Gaza Strip
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0)
*  What is the very latest you're seeing and hearing tonight amidst these reports of thousands of soldiers Israeli soldiers pouring into Gaza as we speak? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=0.0s)]
*  Well Erin more than seven hours now after Israel began this intensified bombing campaign and a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=10.44s)]
*  Expanded ground operation inside of Gaza. We are continuing to hear the steady thuds of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=17.82s)]
*  Explosions coming from inside the Gaza Strip [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=24.58s)]
*  It is extremely rare for us to continue to be hearing explosions this late at night [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=27.5s)]
*  And yet it has been constant for the past seven hours [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=32.44s)]
*  Not only the most intense and sustained bombardment of Gaza that we have been hearing [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=35.22s)]
*  Over the nearly three weeks that we have been covering this war [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=40.66s)]
*  But the loudest booms shaking really this hotel where we are which is about six miles away [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=43.54s)]
*  From the Gaza Strip and we are also hearing helicopters overhead drone activity as well [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=49.76s)]
*  These are the sights and sounds that we have not heard over the last several weeks and the images [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=55.88s)]
*  Coming out of Gaza of these strikes are just absolutely [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=60.68s)]
*  Stunning and terrifying when you consider the fact that there are people in the Gaza Strip and we know that the civilian [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=64.4s)]
*  Casualties have only been rising over these recent days as Israel has been [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=71.36s)]
*  Intensifying its strikes in Gaza and also beginning to carry out some of these targeted raids [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=75.92s)]
*  Which it says are intended to try and take out these Hamas tunnels and other infrastructure in preparation for a larger scale [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=80.64s)]
*  ground invasion of Gaza now what we don't know Aaron is whether or not this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=88.24s)]
*  Expanded ground operation that we are witnessing this evening whether or not that is that ground invasion that top Israeli military? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=92.88s)]
*  And political leaders have been telegraphing now for days [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=100.56s)]
*  Vowing that it will come at a time and place of Israel's choosing we don't know yet whether that has begun [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=104.72s)]
*  This evening, but what we do know as you hear more thuds overhead right now is that this could risk the? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=111.4s)]
*  Negotiations that have been ongoing very sensitive complex negotiations in recent days to try and secure the release of some of those [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=119.12s)]
*  Civilian hostages being held inside of Gaza earlier today [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=126.64s)]
*  I spoke with a senior US official who said that regardless of what Israel is doing tonight [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Expanding this operation that those talks will continue [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=135.68s)]
*  But again certainly less optimism now about the fate of those talks than earlier in the day general hurtling [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=138.8s)]
*  Let me start with you you heard Alan said obviously not wanting to talk about operational details [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=145.08s)]
*  But the reality of it is here is you already had the biggest round [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=149.4s)]
*  Of a ground assault on Gaza in a decade this week tonight the counter-attack in Gaza is expanding [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  We have Barack ravine's report that thousands of Israeli soldiers are pouring into [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=159.72s)]
*  Gaza right now and that he expects that to continue into these early hours of the morning as dawn approaches here [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=165.12s)]
*  What do you think we're looking at? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=171.64s)]
*  Well, we're we can't define it [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=174.16s)]
*  Uniquely Aaron it could be one of several things it could be an expansion [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=178.64s)]
*  Of their operations as you stated it could be the initial stages of an of an assault [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=183.64s)]
*  With more forces going in or it could be sending an additional message to Hamas [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=189.48s)]
*  Saying we're tired of playing around with getting the hostages back. We are going to start the operation [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=194.76s)]
*  but from my take truthfully having seen this kind of operation before with the extensive amount of bombing and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=200.04s)]
*  artillery barrages and movement of forces this seems to be the early stages of [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=206.68s)]
*  Troop movements into the Gaza Strip [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=211.92s)]
*  General Hodges on top of this as we and we're keeping up live pictures of Gaza both to emphasize the darkness [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=216.28s)]
*  And also so people can see when explosions do light up the sky because we do hear a lot of action there along that border [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  A lot of sound right now there does appear to be part of this blackout [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=228.4s)]
*  Internet cell outage general Hodges you heard Ilan Levy refused to comment on that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Whether that would continue [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=241.48s)]
*  What do you think we're looking at on that and does that is that now going to just remain this way? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=243.76s)]
*  Well I think of course I agree with how Mark has already described things [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=252.0s)]
*  To to knock out the communications would be a logical thing to do for the Israeli Defense Force to make it difficult for Hamas to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=257.8s)]
*  Reposition to direct their own troops and their response this has the feeling to me of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  Israeli forces that are going to fill the spaces that are there [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  they're going to try and dominate as much of Gaza as they can as they continue to build up and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  These first couple of sort of armored raids that went in where I think were intended to develop intelligence to figure out [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=285.64s)]
*  How is Hamas defending where are their gaps? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=294.76s)]
*  Where are they where are their potential traps? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=298.52s)]
*  And now you're seeing the mass of troops starting to come in to begin to fill [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  the spaces and I think to accomplish the end state that the advisor justice or the spokesman just described [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=307.36s)]
*  It's going to require [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  Time but a lot of to be able to dominate that space [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=316.56s)]
*  General hurtling you commanded us forces in northern Iraq. So that means of course you were in Mosul. Is this worse? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=320.68s)]
*  This is exponentially worse Aaron there there were a couple of fights in Mosul [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=329.12s)]
*  I was involved in one of them in 2007 and eight forces from our command [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=334.2s)]
*  Fought for several months along with five divisions of Iraqi forces [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=339.8s)]
*  This is a tough fight and they don't compare in terms of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=344.36s)]
*  Relative enemy action in Mosul. We had al Qaeda in 2007 and eight [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=348.48s)]
*  They were in the city in and out of the city ingress and egress [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=353.88s)]
*  They didn't have the kinds of supplies that Hamas has they didn't have the underground tunnel extensive network [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=357.64s)]
*  They didn't have as many [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=364.36s)]
*  Citizens as in as are in Gaza 2.2 million [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=367.12s)]
*  They didn't have the two or three years to prepare for an invasion [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=370.76s)]
*  Into the city of Mosul they just went in and started fighting. So this is going to be [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=375.44s)]
*  Exceedingly tough for the Israeli army exponentially tougher than what we ever faced [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=381.08s)]
*  Sobering reality exponentially tougher, I mean general Hodges [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=388.28s)]
*  How do you think Israeli forces are are dealing with the tunnels in these ground assaults on Gaza? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=391.08s)]
*  I mean if you're flooding thousands of them in there tonight tunnels are the absolute core of any assault [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=396.28s)]
*  What do you think's happening? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=401.08s)]
*  Well, I think the Israeli Defense Force they're probably as well equipped and trained to do this as anybody's army [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=403.12s)]
*  They'll probably use a combination of ground penetrating radar as well as other means to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=410.12s)]
*  Identify the tunnels and then they'll be making tactical decisions about tunnels that either get that are destroyed or are sealed off [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=416.84s)]
*  Or maybe they decide to go in some of them to find out what's going on [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=424.52s)]
*  They know what they're up against and they probably have the right equipment and training to do this [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkep4n5zhA0&t=429.12s)]
