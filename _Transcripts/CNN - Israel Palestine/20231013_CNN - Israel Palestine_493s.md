# Israeli military shells southern Lebanon in response to explosion at security fence
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ)
*  What you are looking at is a breaking situation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=0.0s)]
*  That is the smoke from what we are told is artillery fire [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=3.24s)]
*  from northern Israel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=7.2s)]
*  You can hear some of the blast there into southern Lebanon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=10.14s)]
*  All right, those are the pictures. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=14.64s)]
*  Now let me show you on the map [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=15.88s)]
*  what we're looking at right now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=17.14s)]
*  This is the border between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=18.22s)]
*  Let's go to southern Lebanon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  Our Ben Wiedemann is standing by there. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=22.42s)]
*  Ben, give us a sense of what you are seeing and hearing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=25.18s)]
*  John, in the last few minutes we heard several large explosions [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=30.92s)]
*  in the mid-distance. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=34.56s)]
*  Right behind me what you're seeing is the mountain. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=36.16s)]
*  On one half of it is Lebanon, the other is Israel, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=39.0s)]
*  and right below me is the Israeli community of Metula. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=42.3s)]
*  Now we heard this is a town that's been under... [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=45.94s)]
*  It's a closed military area for the last few hours. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=48.54s)]
*  But as I said, in the last few minutes we heard [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=51.18s)]
*  several large explosions in the distance. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  That in addition to what is going on to the west of here, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=57.24s)]
*  nearer to the Mediterranean, along the border, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=60.6s)]
*  where we understand, according to the Lebanese news, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=63.88s)]
*  the official Lebanese news agency, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=66.24s)]
*  several rockets were fired in the direction of Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=68.74s)]
*  They were intercepted by the Iron Dome system. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=71.68s)]
*  The Israelis later apparently targeted, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=76.16s)]
*  according to the Lebanese news agency, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=78.56s)]
*  an army observation point. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=81.4s)]
*  And we understand that there are ongoing exchanges [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=83.82000000000001s)]
*  in that area as well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=87.72s)]
*  Now this is sort of a change from the pace [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=89.98s)]
*  during the rest of the day. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=93.62s)]
*  Earlier in the day it was relatively quiet. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=95.26s)]
*  In fact, the assumption was that perhaps [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=97.42s)]
*  the worst had passed here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=101.4s)]
*  I just heard another explosion. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=102.66000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you heard that as well, and another one. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  So it does appear that things are picking up. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  I can hear the impact of that one in this direction. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  There are Lebanese soldiers here [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=115.22s)]
*  observing what's going on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I'm just gonna step out of the way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=119.69999999999999s)]
*  If you look at the top of that hill, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=121.6s)]
*  there's a plume of smoke. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  I believe, but I'm not certain, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=125.33999999999999s)]
*  that on that side of the hill is Lebanon. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=127.24s)]
*  But I can't say with absolute certainty. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=131.44s)]
*  So yes, this just began a few minutes ago. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=133.54s)]
*  We don't know the reason, the cause, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=136.98s)]
*  but certainly the tensions here are extremely high. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah, the main sort of military force in this area, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=147.44s)]
*  in addition to the Lebanese army, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  has by and large been relatively restrained [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=153.12s)]
*  since the outbreak of fighting in Gaza. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=156.52s)]
*  I can hear another impact. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=161.24s)]
*  So yeah, you can see there's smoke on the top of the hill. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=162.56s)]
*  It appears multiple impacts up there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=165.44s)]
*  What I think I'm hearing is outgoing fire, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  and then moments later you hear the impact. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  There it is right there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=174.9s)]
*  John? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=176.28s)]
*  Yeah, we hear the thuds. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=177.68s)]
*  We hear the thuds, Ben. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=179.58s)]
*  And if you can explain, and you know this region so well, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=181.74s)]
*  we've been so focused on Gaza to the south, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=184.66000000000003s)]
*  if you're looking at the map of Israel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=188.52s)]
*  You are, of course, on the northern border [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=190.0s)]
*  between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=191.82000000000002s)]
*  And the concern there from the Israeli perspective, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=193.62s)]
*  I just saw a flash on that hill I did a moment ago. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  The concern. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=200.62s)]
*  The enemy should step out of the way. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=201.46s)]
*  The concern for Israel in terms of what happens in Lebanon [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=203.06s)]
*  isn't so much the Lebanese government per se, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=206.26s)]
*  but it is Hezbollah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=208.3s)]
*  Why are they so concerned about what Hezbollah might do, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=210.06s)]
*  and what kind of lines has Hezbollah publicly drawn? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  It said this is when we'll get involved in this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, obviously, John, the Israelis are concerned [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=222.32s)]
*  by the fact that Hezbollah, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=226.82000000000002s)]
*  and I'm just gonna pop into the car [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=227.66000000000003s)]
*  and get my flak jacket on while I'm talking to you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=229.34s)]
*  The Israelis are concerned [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=232.94000000000003s)]
*  that if Hezbollah becomes involved, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  it is a formidable military organization, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=236.22000000000003s)]
*  made so, excuse me, with the help of Iran. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=240.62s)]
*  And we saw even back in 2006 [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=245.26000000000002s)]
*  that Hezbollah was essentially able to fight the Israelis [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=247.9s)]
*  to a standstill. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=251.3s)]
*  Since then, their capabilities have only improved. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=252.38s)]
*  Their weaponry has only improved. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=256.94s)]
*  They have lots of experience in house-to-house, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=259.06s)]
*  street-to-street warfare from Syria. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=262.54s)]
*  And therefore, if they become involved, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=266.74s)]
*  it's a whole different situation [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=268.94s)]
*  than what you have in Gaza, far greater. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=271.7s)]
*  Yeah, I see another impact up there. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=274.62s)]
*  Now, Hezbollah has sort of said that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=277.22s)]
*  if Israel attacks Lebanon, it will become fully involved. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=280.5s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=288.18s)]
*  has always made it clear that Hezbollah [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=290.34s)]
*  will decide the time and place [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=292.1s)]
*  where it will engage with Israel [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=294.54s)]
*  and that Hezbollah will not be drawn into a war [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=297.26s)]
*  if not of its choosing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=301.46s)]
*  And so basically, it does appear that, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=304.42s)]
*  at least until now, I should stress, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=308.62s)]
*  that Hezbollah has been hesitant [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=311.65999999999997s)]
*  to become involved in this war. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  Now, this could be simply a passing incident, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=315.02s)]
*  not necessarily the beginning of something, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=318.18s)]
*  but it certainly does represent [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=321.5s)]
*  something of a deterioration, John. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=324.7s)]
*  An exchange of fire, to be sure, there. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=327.46s)]
*  We can see the smoke rising above the hill behind you, Ben. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  You're back in frame. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=333.26s)]
*  Now, the smoke rising above the hill. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=334.09999999999997s)]
*  We did see a small flash there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  And to be clear, that smoke rising behind you is Lebanon. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=339.17999999999995s)]
*  Those are the impact zones at this point [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=341.9s)]
*  where things are landing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=344.06s)]
*  That is inside Lebanon, you believe? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=345.02s)]
*  I do believe so, yes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=349.61999999999995s)]
*  I sort of haven't had a chance [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=351.26s)]
*  to check my coordinates exactly, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=353.9s)]
*  but I do believe that is Lebanon. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=355.85999999999996s)]
*  All right, Ben, we do appreciate you being there, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=358.34s)]
*  being witness to this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=360.38s)]
*  Be safe and please do keep us posted [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=362.09999999999997s)]
*  because these developments are so crucial [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=364.05999999999995s)]
*  to see if it does escalate even more. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=366.26000000000005s)]
*  All right, Ben Wiedemann up here [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=369.18s)]
*  on the board between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna go down here now to Gaza. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=373.46000000000004s)]
*  I can show you the situation there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=375.86s)]
*  Our Erin Burnett is in southern Israel, not far. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=378.70000000000005s)]
*  This is the border. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=382.5s)]
*  This is Gaza right here. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  This is Egypt right here. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=384.58000000000004s)]
*  She's not far from Gaza. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=386.22s)]
*  She's not far from Egypt in this region right here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=387.5s)]
*  Erin, what are you seeing now? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=392.82000000000005s)]
*  All right, so we're just over a ridge [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=394.18s)]
*  from a major staging area for an Israeli tank battalion, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=396.82s)]
*  John, and basically this particular tank battalion, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=400.06s)]
*  they were in on Saturday right after the attacks [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=404.74s)]
*  among the first to go in Saturday afternoon, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  and they're now staging, resupplying, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=409.22s)]
*  and they say they're ready. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's really what we've seen [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=413.54s)]
*  because we have been spending time going up and down [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=414.7s)]
*  along this Gaza border. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=417.26s)]
*  Right now we're about three miles away [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=419.22s)]
*  from the Gaza border itself, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=421.22s)]
*  and as you and Kate have been saying, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=422.38s)]
*  we're about 10 or so miles from the Egyptian border. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=424.38s)]
*  So right here along the south, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=427.34s)]
*  where there's been massive staging of Israeli forces, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  and when you hear that going by, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=431.9s)]
*  those are all military vehicles. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=433.17999999999995s)]
*  I will say they're also, though, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=435.65999999999997s)]
*  busing in troops on buses, literally coaches. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=437.61999999999995s)]
*  So if you say 50 or so of those, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=441.82s)]
*  just even in the past bit, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=443.73999999999995s)]
*  we've seen about 250 troops just coming in. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=444.82s)]
*  It's just a constant flow in, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  and if we're gonna think that they've been saying [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=450.34s)]
*  they have 300, 350,000 troops already [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=451.94s)]
*  along this border where we are, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=454.65999999999997s)]
*  they've been just adding in constantly through the day, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  constantly through the day, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=459.58s)]
*  and we have seen a higher state of readiness, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=460.73999999999995s)]
*  not just with a tank battalion that we're looking at here, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=462.73999999999995s)]
*  but also with the troops coming in, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=465.53999999999996s)]
*  wearing their helmets, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=467.41999999999996s)]
*  wearing their protective equipment. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=468.26s)]
*  They are ready, and there is a state of readiness, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  and obviously what that exactly means, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=472.62s)]
*  we can't tell you in terms of how imminent [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=474.94s)]
*  any action might be, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=476.58s)]
*  but we have seen that shift between today [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=477.65999999999997s)]
*  and the past few days, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=479.58s)]
*  and we continue to hear the outgoing artillery fire [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=480.62s)]
*  followed by those thuds of explosions. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=483.53999999999996s)]
*  In this case, in Gaza, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=485.65999999999997s)]
*  similar to what, of course, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=487.58s)]
*  Ben was just showing you live [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=489.02s)]
*  as that artillery was coming into southern Lebanon. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA_LUFCj5LQ&t=490.94s)]
