# Crowd storms Russian airport after flight arrives from Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24)
*  This was something that was a lot worse than just a protest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=0.0s)]
*  Essentially what this descended into was this mob of people, this crowd of people hunting [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Jews and hunting Israelis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  That's essentially what transcended at that airport in the town of Makhachkala, which [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=15.82s)]
*  is actually the capital of the Dagestan region in the North Caucasus of Russia. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=19.98s)]
*  There's some really troubling scenes, not just of that protest that took place inside [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=24.62s)]
*  the terminal building where that was charged, that crowd overwhelming the security forces, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=28.42s)]
*  then getting onto the tarmac, but also some of the people in that crowd singling out folks [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=32.74s)]
*  who apparently were on that flight from Tel Aviv, taking away their passports and essentially [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=37.82s)]
*  making them prove that they are not Jews. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=43.18s)]
*  And there was some condemnation from the religious leader of that region, but we have also just [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=45.38s)]
*  heard from the Kremlin. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=50.36s)]
*  They are blaming outside influence, as they put it, for inciting that crowd. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDhnkONaM24&t=52.28s)]
