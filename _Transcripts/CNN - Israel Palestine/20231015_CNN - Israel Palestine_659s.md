# 'Israelis are bombing the crap out of Gaza': Tapper presses Biden official on American hostages
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg)
*  Is rescuing the hostages a priority at all? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, Israeli news media, like Haaretz, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=2.92s)]
*  they say it doesn't seem like it at all. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=5.04s)]
*  And frankly, Jake, if my kids were being held hostage [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=6.88s)]
*  in Gaza, and as you know, there are Americans [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=9.6s)]
*  being held hostage in Gaza right now, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=12.26s)]
*  I'd want you to send in the Navy SEALs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=14.52s)]
*  What's the conversation like in the White House [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=16.8s)]
*  about the U.S. conducting any sort of operations [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=19.92s)]
*  in order to save Americans being held hostage in Gaza? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=23.12s)]
*  Well, the president has been very clear [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=27.56s)]
*  that he has no higher priority [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=30.72s)]
*  than getting Americans back safe, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=32.46s)]
*  Americans who are being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=34.56s)]
*  The Israelis are bombing the crap out of Gaza, Jake. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=37.12s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't seem like saving the hostages [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=39.96s)]
*  are a priority at all right now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=44.5s)]
*  Well, for President Biden, they are a priority. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=48.34s)]
*  They're the highest possible priority, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=51.36s)]
*  and he has sent hostage experts to coordinate [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=53.58s)]
*  and consult with the Israeli government [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=57.18s)]
*  on hostage recovery efforts. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=58.9s)]
*  He's also made sure that our diplomats are in touch [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=60.3s)]
*  with third countries in the region [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=63.42s)]
*  to explore avenues for their safe release. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=65.62s)]
*  I have to be cautious about how much I can say [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=67.86s)]
*  about certain efforts he's undertaking [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=70.58s)]
*  because we want to protect those efforts [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=72.38s)]
*  to give us the best possible chance [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=75.1s)]
*  of getting our people home. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Now, Jake, one important point [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=77.9s)]
*  when it comes to the issue of the Navy SEALs [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=79.42s)]
*  is we do not at this point have pinpoint location information [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=82.02s)]
*  for where the American hostages are. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=87.06s)]
*  So we have to continue to refine our understanding [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=89.22s)]
*  of where they are and even, Jake, who they are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=92.58s)]
*  because we know there are 15 unaccounted for Americans, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  but we cannot confirm the precise number [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=98.44s)]
*  of American hostages being held by Hamas at this time. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=100.89999999999999s)]
*  All we can do is to continue to work closely [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=105.42s)]
*  with the Israeli government on hostage recovery options, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=108.17999999999999s)]
*  which we are doing, and then work through third countries [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=110.78s)]
*  to see if there are avenues for release. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=113.86s)]
*  Those efforts are underway. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=115.98s)]
*  Our hope is that they can produce results. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=117.62s)]
*  We will continue to stay focused on this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=119.9s)]
*  It's as high a priority as the president has. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=122.18s)]
*  One senior political operative with Hamas [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=124.78s)]
*  floated the possibility a few days ago [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  of a potential prisoner swap with the U.S. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=128.74s)]
*  for the release of hostages. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=131.94s)]
*  Would the U.S. entertain that? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  We have not looked at that, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=135.02s)]
*  that we have not heard from them something like that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=138.18s)]
*  That's not something that is currently [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=140.58s)]
*  under active discussion. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  It has not been proposed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=143.18s)]
*  What we are focused on instead, as I said before, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  are pursuing avenues with third countries for release. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the details [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=149.74s)]
*  of what that might look like again, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=151.18s)]
*  to protect those channels [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=152.62s)]
*  in hopes that they can bear some fruit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=155.02s)]
*  But I will say that President Biden has shown [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=157.94s)]
*  over the course of the past few years [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=160.70000000000002s)]
*  that we have been working closely with the U.S. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=162.46s)]
*  that he will make hard decisions [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=165.62s)]
*  to get American hostages home. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=167.78s)]
*  In this case, our focus is on working [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  through those third country channels, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  and I'll leave it at that for now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  So I think there are serious reasons to question [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=176.22s)]
*  how good any intelligence about what is in Gaza is. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=179.18s)]
*  I mean, obviously, Hamas was able to carry out [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=183.66s)]
*  this horrific attack eight days ago, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=187.14s)]
*  catching everybody completely off guard. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  You just said that we don't know [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=193.05999999999997s)]
*  where the hostages are in Gaza. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  And yet the Israelis claim, the IDF claims, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=198.5s)]
*  that it is bombing places that it knows are Hamas targets. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=201.98s)]
*  How can we be sure that that's true? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=211.77999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Hamas is a terrorist group. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=214.82s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, but how do we know anything [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=218.1s)]
*  about what they're hitting, given the fact [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=221.85999999999999s)]
*  that it doesn't sound like any of the intelligence [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=223.9s)]
*  inside Gaza is particularly good? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=226.66s)]
*  Well, Jake, Israel has known where particular parts [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=232.54s)]
*  of Hamas' terrorist infrastructure have been located. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=237.34s)]
*  They know, for example, where rockets are fired from, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=240.14s)]
*  and they can go back to those locations [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=242.74s)]
*  to take out the rocket emplacements. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=245.22s)]
*  They know from various forms of intelligence collection [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=247.26s)]
*  where certain individuals are located, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=250.02s)]
*  who are senior commanders in Hamas [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  who are part of the bloody and barbaric attacks [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=254.42000000000002s)]
*  that took place against Israel last Saturday. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=257.98s)]
*  So they do have information to be able to go after [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=260.62s)]
*  specific targets, actionable targets, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=265.06s)]
*  similar to the way the United States has been able [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  to do that in other places in other contexts. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=270.02s)]
*  The United States has taken a very clear stand. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=273.14s)]
*  It is a stand that we don't just take in this situation, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=276.7s)]
*  but we've taken all along, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=279.66s)]
*  which is that we stand for the rule of law, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=281.46000000000004s)]
*  we stand for the law of war, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=283.54s)]
*  we stand for the protection of civilians, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=285.14000000000004s)]
*  and we wanna make sure that innocent Palestinians [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=287.06s)]
*  who have nothing to do with Hamas can get to safe areas [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=290.54s)]
*  where they will be safe from bombardment [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=293.82000000000005s)]
*  and where they will have access to necessities [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=296.06s)]
*  like food, water, shelter, and medicine. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=298.74s)]
*  Well, I mean, you say you stand for the rule of law. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=301.82000000000005s)]
*  Again, Hamas is vile. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=304.38s)]
*  What they did eight days ago, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=305.86s)]
*  they're targeting civilians. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=307.14000000000004s)]
*  It's horrific, but what's going on right now [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=308.86s)]
*  is not just a punishment of Hamas. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=311.1s)]
*  More than 700 children have been reportedly killed in Gaza, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=313.46000000000004s)]
*  and obviously, electricity, food, water supplies [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=317.18s)]
*  have been cut off by Israel to the totality of Gaza. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=320.74s)]
*  Obviously, the blockade is not just by Israel, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=325.42s)]
*  it's by Egypt, too. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=327.62s)]
*  Take a listen to what Secretary Blinken said last year [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  when Putin was targeting Ukrainian infrastructure. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=331.34000000000003s)]
*  Heat, water, electricity, for children, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=335.58s)]
*  for the elderly, for the sick. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=342.58s)]
*  These are President Putin's new targets. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=345.22s)]
*  He's hitting them hard. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=348.14s)]
*  This brutalization of Ukraine's people is barbaric. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=350.5s)]
*  Now look, Israel is not Russia, Gaza is not Ukraine. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=355.5s)]
*  It's a different situation, but cutting off supplies, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=360.22s)]
*  cutting off heat, cutting off water to civilians, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=363.86s)]
*  what's the difference? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=369.06s)]
*  Well, first, thank you for saying that Israel is not Russia [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=372.78s)]
*  because Israel is not Russia. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=375.78s)]
*  Second, as I said before, we are in constant contact. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=377.18s)]
*  Yes, absolutely, they are, and they deserve, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=381.38s)]
*  as I said before, access to water and medicine and food, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=384.3s)]
*  and we are working actively to ensure that that happens. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=387.7s)]
*  And I can tell you this morning, Jake, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=390.62s)]
*  that I have been in touch with my Israeli counterparts [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=392.62s)]
*  just within the last hour, who report to me [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=395.02s)]
*  that they have, in fact, turned the water pipe back on [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=397.97999999999996s)]
*  in southern Gaza. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=401.26s)]
*  That has been the subject of discussion [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=402.58s)]
*  over the course of the past few days. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=404.58s)]
*  The United States is gonna continue working with Israel, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  with the UN, with Egypt, with Jordan, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=408.7s)]
*  and with a lot of the groups on the ground [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  to make sure that innocent Palestinians get access [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=413.65999999999997s)]
*  to those basic necessities [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=417.29999999999995s)]
*  and are protected from bombardment [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=418.7s)]
*  because they deserve that right, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=420.82s)]
*  the right to those necessities [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=422.98s)]
*  and the right to safety and security [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  every bit as much as Ukrainian civilians do [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=426.38s)]
*  or civilians anywhere do. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=428.5s)]
*  And the United States hasn't made any bones about that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=429.86s)]
*  We're working hard on that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=432.54s)]
*  We're working to make sure that that is the case [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=433.62s)]
*  as this unfolds, and it's something that has been [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=436.34s)]
*  a high priority for President Biden, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=439.02s)]
*  for Secretary Blinken, and for myself. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=440.58s)]
*  But you're not telling the Israelis [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=442.3s)]
*  to let the Palestinian hospitals have power? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=443.38s)]
*  Our position is that hospitals should be able to function. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=447.34s)]
*  Hospitals should not be targeted. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=452.34s)]
*  People should be able to get access [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=453.94s)]
*  to lifesaving medical care. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  We don't qualify these statements. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=457.29999999999995s)]
*  We don't say that there's some kind of caveat to them. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=459.06s)]
*  These are simple, clear, declarative statements. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=462.85999999999996s)]
*  It is our position that's consistent [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=465.53999999999996s)]
*  with the law of armed conflict, the law of war. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=467.38s)]
*  It's consistent with our view as we have presented it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=470.06s)]
*  And I would just say that we're not gonna let the U.S. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=473.26s)]
*  have to do it, and I would just say, Jake, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=475.7s)]
*  that there's a lot of reports in the Fog of War [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=476.85999999999996s)]
*  about things that happen. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=478.94s)]
*  We're not gonna respond to every one of those [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=480.29999999999995s)]
*  because we will seek clarity in the appropriate way, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=482.38s)]
*  but we will never back off our basic principles [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=486.85999999999996s)]
*  and our basic proposition, which we have made [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=489.9s)]
*  both publicly and privately about our view [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=492.34s)]
*  about how civilians have to be protected. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=495.46s)]
*  I haven't asked you, haven't you, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  any of the Fog of War stories. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=498.06s)]
*  I've seen stories that blame Israel for things [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=499.38s)]
*  that later on it turns out Hamas did them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=502.9s)]
*  I get it, I understand, but we have reports, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=506.02s)]
*  and I'm sure you have them too, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=509.9s)]
*  that hundreds of the individuals stuck in Gaza [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=511.09999999999997s)]
*  are American citizens. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=513.22s)]
*  You know that too. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=514.8199999999999s)]
*  There are also hundreds of thousands of Americans [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=515.66s)]
*  in Israel that are trying to get out also, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=520.8199999999999s)]
*  and the Biden administration is doing a lot [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=522.98s)]
*  to get those individuals out. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=524.5799999999999s)]
*  29 of the individuals killed by Hamas were American, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=526.14s)]
*  and there are, I think, what is it, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=530.74s)]
*  something like 40 Americans that are unaccounted for [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=532.5s)]
*  who were maybe taken prisoner by Hamas, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=535.6600000000001s)]
*  but I wanna talk to you about one Palestinian American woman [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=537.38s)]
*  we talked to named Hanin Okal. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=540.26s)]
*  She's from New Jersey. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  She's got three kids, eight, two, and two months. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=544.9s)]
*  I sent you the interview we did with her earlier in the week. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=548.58s)]
*  She got to the border, the Rafah crossing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=550.9s)]
*  She can't get out. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=553.26s)]
*  She can't get out of Gaza [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=555.0600000000001s)]
*  because the Egyptians won't open the crossing. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=556.22s)]
*  Listen to what she told me earlier this week. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=558.46s)]
*  We tried to contact the US embassy so many times. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=562.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, they couldn't help us at all. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=566.14s)]
*  I contacted them through the phone, via email. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=568.6600000000001s)]
*  I texted, and I called different numbers, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=571.74s)]
*  but nobody, I couldn't hear back from any. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  We are all here feeling abandoned that, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=579.82s)]
*  and we're feeling that we're left alone. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=582.98s)]
*  I don't know how many billions of dollars [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=587.86s)]
*  we give the Egyptians every year. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  Why can't you tell President Sisi [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=591.7s)]
*  to open the border to let Americans out? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=593.5s)]
*  We have told President Sisi [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=597.94s)]
*  to open the border to let Americans out. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=599.38s)]
*  The situation there at the crossing [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=601.58s)]
*  is actually more complicated. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=603.26s)]
*  The Egyptians have in fact agreed to allow Americans [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=604.7800000000001s)]
*  to depart to get safe passage through the Rafah crossing. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=608.5s)]
*  The Israelis agreed to ensure that the area around there [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=611.6600000000001s)]
*  would be safe at least as far as they were able to do so. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=615.1400000000001s)]
*  The question when we tried to move a group yesterday [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=618.62s)]
*  was actually Hamas taking steps [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=621.86s)]
*  to try and stop that from happening. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=624.0200000000001s)]
*  But we are continuing to work this around the clock, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=626.0600000000001s)]
*  and we are doing all that we can [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=628.7s)]
*  to make sure that American citizens who are in Gaza [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=631.1s)]
*  can get through that border crossing. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=633.7s)]
*  Secretary Blinken in fact is in Egypt today [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=635.1800000000001s)]
*  meeting with the President of Egypt. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=638.6600000000001s)]
*  This is at the top of his list [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=640.62s)]
*  to help get those American citizens out of Gaza. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=642.58s)]
*  Anyone who is a U.S. citizen [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=646.42s)]
*  should have the right to free passage through there [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=649.18s)]
*  and then have the U.S. government [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=651.74s)]
*  facilitate their travel home. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=653.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't doubt that the biggest problem [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=655.3399999999999s)]
*  in all of this is Hamas. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtAz61fKLeg&t=657.9799999999999s)]
