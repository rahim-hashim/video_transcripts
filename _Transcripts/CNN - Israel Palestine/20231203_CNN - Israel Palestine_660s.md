# Hear Jayapal's response after Bash says some have been silent about Hamas' use of sexual violence
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI)
*  With the collapse of the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=0.0s)]
*  here in the U.S., democratic divisions over the direction of the war [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=3.72s)]
*  and Biden's support for Israel are once again on full display. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Here with me now is House Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Pramila Jayapal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=11.52s)]
*  Thank you for coming. It's nice to see you in person. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=15.08s)]
*  Let's start with where we are right now with the war. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=18.2s)]
*  The White House says very clearly that Hamas is to blame [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=21.52s)]
*  for the collapse of this temporary truce for a few reasons. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=24.52s)]
*  One is that they refused to release the remaining women, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=27.96s)]
*  some of whom, it sounds like most of whom are 20 to 30 year old women. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=33.04s)]
*  They're hostage inside Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=37.52s)]
*  They also renewed the military attacks against Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  You have repeatedly called for Israel to implement an indefinite ceasefire. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=43.040000000000006s)]
*  But given what we have just seen with what I just described, is that realistic? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=47.6s)]
*  Well, it's what has to happen. And I do think it's realistic. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  I think what we saw is after, you know, many weeks of saying [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=56.44s)]
*  we couldn't get to a ceasefire, that was not going to happen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=59.8s)]
*  We did have a temporary ceasefire. And what happened? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  We were able to see a significant number of hostages released. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=64.88s)]
*  We were able to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  And I think the long term plan for what happens is incredibly important. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=72.24s)]
*  Now you've seen Vice President Harris made a very strong statement yesterday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=77.4s)]
*  Secretary, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=82.56s)]
*  also was very clear that if you engage in urban warfare [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=86.36s)]
*  in the way that Israel did in northern Gaza, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=90.24s)]
*  what you will do is perhaps win a temporary victory or reprieve. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=93.56s)]
*  But you're not going to win the long term strategic war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=98.24s)]
*  So the only way, Dana, to get through this is to make sure that we, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  first of all, do not have the kinds of casualties that we saw in northern Gaza. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=105.52s)]
*  There's no way to do that with the kind of war that Israel is waging right now on Gaza. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=110.84s)]
*  A couple of things. One is you said it worked. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=116.04s)]
*  Yes, there were hostages who were released, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=119.48s)]
*  but it wasn't even an actual hard ceasefire. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  They were just trying to get another day and Hamas wouldn't comply. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=126.04s)]
*  So what makes you think that Hamas would comply with a longer term ceasefire? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=129.72s)]
*  Well, I think this is all about negotiation. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  Qatar has been incredibly helpful here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=136.76s)]
*  It's not clear to me from the reporting who was to blame for. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=139.68s)]
*  You don't believe the U.S. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration that Hamas. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=145.68s)]
*  Well, I just think it's very complicated. Young women. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  I think it's very, very complicated. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  It's it's not we don't have all the information in front of us. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  We obviously can, you know, can rely on some statements that are made. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  But I think that in these negotiations, everybody wants something. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=160.08s)]
*  And I think Qatar has said that Hamas is still at the table. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  Israel should still be at the table. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  In fact, some of the hostages are the Israeli hostages are saying [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=169.0s)]
*  that Israel should still be at the table because this is complex negotiation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=173.2s)]
*  And it doesn't happen unless both sides are willing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=178.2s)]
*  to come to some kind of an agreement. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=182.28s)]
*  That's how we got the first seven days. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=184.12s)]
*  That's that's a really important point about both sides being willing [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=186.12s)]
*  to come to an agreement, because regardless of what has happened [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=189.6s)]
*  at last week, and let's just say there is a more permanent ceasefire. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=194.44s)]
*  You are hearing from Hamas leaders over and over again [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=199.32s)]
*  that the brutal massacre of the 1200 [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=202.76s)]
*  Israeli civilians was just the beginning, just a rehearsal, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=206.92s)]
*  and that they want to continue to do it over and over again. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=210.48s)]
*  So a ceasefire would keep that brutal terrorist regime in place in Gaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=214.04s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=219.28s)]
*  I think that what is true is that Hamas needs to be taken out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  It is a terrorist organization. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  But I think the way to do that, as many terrorism experts have said, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=226.04s)]
*  is to create a durable and strong coalition of allies within the Middle East, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  with the United States, with Israel, to make sure that we have a long term [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=235.96s)]
*  political solution, that there is an alternative to Hamas to lead [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=240.68s)]
*  in Gaza and to establish a state for Palestinians. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=245.88s)]
*  This is I mean, we cannot we have to condemn what Hamas did on October 7th. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=249.4s)]
*  We cannot allow for 15000 [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=254.32000000000002s)]
*  Palestinians to date to have been killed, three quarters of whom [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=258.04s)]
*  are women and children, and say that that is going to help us [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=262.12s)]
*  and can listen morally, Dana, morally, but also strategically for Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  The only way through this is to create a situation [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=271.64000000000004s)]
*  where there is a political solution that involves a Palestinian state [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=275.92s)]
*  and an Israeli state. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=279.48s)]
*  Ideally, what you're talking about could make sense. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  It's just unclear how you get from here to there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  Who's going to get rid of Hamas if if if if. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=287.08s)]
*  If there's no continued war, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=292.67999999999995s)]
*  and I think what you're relying on is the pressure from Arab states, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=295.64s)]
*  and they haven't been willing to do that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=301.0s)]
*  It's not just that. Well, part of the reason they haven't been willing to do that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  is because we have been allowing Israel to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=305.52s)]
*  literally indiscriminately bomb hospitals, violate international humanitarian law. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=310.4s)]
*  And so we are creating pre October. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=315.88s)]
*  OK, even pre October 7th. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  Can I just ask you one more thing about that? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=319.64s)]
*  You have seen the information [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=322.24s)]
*  and intelligence that Hamas has used its own civilians. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=325.2s)]
*  The death of civilians are horrendous, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=329.8s)]
*  but Hamas has used its own civilians as human shields. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=332.88s)]
*  Those hospitals and so forth are places where Hamas [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=335.44s)]
*  keeps weapons and keeps its. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=339.64s)]
*  Civilians, it's Hamas leadership that they had their headquarters there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=343.72s)]
*  Dana, international humanitarian law says that you cannot attack a hospital [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=347.16s)]
*  unless there is there are some circumstances. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  If if rockets are fired from that hospital, that is one thing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  But hospitals are protected. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=360.24s)]
*  We have had refugee camps that are bombed right now. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=362.8s)]
*  There are even the only pediatric hospital in Gaza is not operating. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=366.32000000000005s)]
*  If we want to defeat terrorists, we have to abide by international humanitarian law. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=371.88s)]
*  That is just my fundamental belief. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=377.28s)]
*  And that at the end of the day, what we need is a lasting coalition [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=379.28s)]
*  that is not going to be formed if Israel continues to do what they are doing. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=384.16s)]
*  And the United States cannot be backers of this kind of indiscriminate bombing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=388.72s)]
*  That is my firm belief. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=394.72s)]
*  We should have conditions on military aid in the same way that we do [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=396.24s)]
*  for every other country. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=400.08s)]
*  I want to ask you about sexual violence and. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=401.08s)]
*  The it's kind of remarkable that this issue hasn't gotten enough attention [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  globally, widespread use of rape, brutal rape, sexual violence against Israeli women by Hamas. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=411.91999999999996s)]
*  I've seen a lot of progressive women, generally speaking, they're quick to defend women's rights. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  They're quick to defend women's rights and speak out against using rape as a weapon of war. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=427.6s)]
*  But downright silent on what we saw on October 7th and what might be happening [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=434.24s)]
*  inside Gaza right now to these hostages. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=440.72s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=443.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't know that that's true. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=444.4s)]
*  I think we always talk about the impact of war on women in particular. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=446.96s)]
*  In fact, I remember 20 years ago, I did a petition around the war in Iraq. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=451.28s)]
*  You said you talked about it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=454.72s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=456.24s)]
*  And I've condemned what Hamas has done. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  I've condemned all of the actions. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=459.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=461.6s)]
*  The rape, the of course. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=462.32s)]
*  But I think we have to remember that Israel is a democracy. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=464.88s)]
*  That is why they are a strong ally of ours. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  And if they do not comply with international humanitarian law, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=472.8s)]
*  they are bringing themselves to a place that makes it much more difficult [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=476.72s)]
*  strategically for them to be able to build the kinds of allies to keep public opinion with them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  And frankly, morally, I think we cannot say that one war crime deserves another. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=486.0s)]
*  That is not what international humanitarian law says. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=491.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=494.24s)]
*  With respect, I was just asking about the women and you turned it back to Israel. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=494.8s)]
*  I'm asking you about Hamas. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=500.64s)]
*  In fact, I already answered your question, Dana. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=501.92s)]
*  I said it's horrific and I think that rape is horrific, sexual assault is horrific. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=504.32s)]
*  I think that it happens in war situations. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=509.28s)]
*  Terrorist organizations like Hamas obviously are using these as tools. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=512.72s)]
*  However, I think we have to be balanced about bringing in the outrages against Palestinians. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=517.52s)]
*  15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes, three quarters of whom are women and children. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=525.52s)]
*  And it's horrible, but you don't see Israeli soldiers raping Palestinian women. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=534.0s)]
*  I don't want this to be the hierarchy of oppressions. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=540.4000000000001s)]
*  I think 15,000 people have been killed, Palestinians. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=543.12s)]
*  Which is horrible. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=546.48s)]
*  2.2 million Palestinians live in a 140 square mile area, which is about the size of Las Vegas, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  with a population that is four times that of Las Vegas. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=555.2800000000001s)]
*  And 1.8 million Palestinians right now are displaced. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  They are living in shelters. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=564.08s)]
*  They are being told to move to South Gaza, then South Gaza is being bombed. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=565.6s)]
*  They're being told to move to North Gaza. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=569.76s)]
*  There are no homes left. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=572.0s)]
*  The vast majority of infrastructure has been destroyed. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=573.36s)]
*  This is not the way that we are going to beat terrorism, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=576.72s)]
*  whether it's Hamas or some future iteration of Hamas. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=580.48s)]
*  On that note, I want to talk about what this means domestically for President Biden. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=584.0s)]
*  You've warned that the way that the Biden administration, the president himself, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=588.24s)]
*  is handling this war, jeopardizes his support among progressives and Muslim American voters, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=593.0400000000001s)]
*  and that they could actually stay home. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that that is, how big of a threat, political threat is that to President Biden, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=602.08s)]
*  in particular when it's possible, at this point probable, that Donald Trump would be his opponent, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=608.64s)]
*  and he's not exactly warm when it comes to Muslims? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=614.48s)]
*  That's an understatement. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=621.12s)]
*  Look, I am a supporter of President Biden. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=623.36s)]
*  I have been out there for the president, and I will continue to be, even though I think that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=625.28s)]
*  the way that this, the handling of this war started was unfortunately such that it has [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=631.28s)]
*  alienated huge communities. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=639.6s)]
*  We have to be realistic about that, and we have to do work right now to address that, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  not just with outreach here, but actually looking at the situation in the Middle East [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=647.36s)]
*  and recognizing that Palestinians deserve the same respect, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=651.92s)]
*  innocent Palestinians deserve the same respect as innocent Israelis. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-CC53G5asI&t=655.6s)]
