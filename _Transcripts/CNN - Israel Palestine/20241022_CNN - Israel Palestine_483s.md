# Blinken in the Middle East for the eleventh time since Oct 7, with no ceasefire deal in sight
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0)
*  the top US diplomat back in the Middle East for the 11th time since the October 7th terror [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=0.0s)]
*  attacks that set off the war in Gaza. This time, the stakes could not be higher. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=5.92s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=13.76s)]
*  and other top officials as this region braces for an Israeli strike on Iran in retaliation [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=17.36s)]
*  for Iran's most recent attack on Israel. Blinken's visit coming amid pessimism in Washington [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=23.52s)]
*  over the prospect of finding a diplomatic solution to stop the wars in Gaza and in Lebanon. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=31.52s)]
*  Israel today defending its bombing near a hospital on the outskirts of Beirut that officials [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=39.04s)]
*  say killed at least 13 people, including a child. And inside Gaza, the Health Ministry [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=43.28s)]
*  reports more than 42,000 people have been killed and some 100,000 injured since the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=49.48s)]
*  start of the war. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees describes horrific [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=56.12s)]
*  conditions in northern Gaza where residents have been warned to evacuate. He writes on [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  the X platform that the smell of death is everywhere. Paula Hancock has been reporting [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=68.44s)]
*  both Israel and Lebanon throughout this conflict. She's joining me now here in the studio today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=74.88s)]
*  Good to have you. And Kylie Atwood is at the State Department. And Kylie, let me start [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=79.83999999999999s)]
*  with you. In your most recent reporting, you say that Tony Blinken, the US Secretary of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=84.36s)]
*  State, will discuss the day after plans for Gaza on this trip. But the fundamentals of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=88.84s)]
*  the deadlocked talks remain unchanged. Where are we as Blinken begins this tour? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=95.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, with your point to the day after plans, they will be discussed. But a senior [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=105.56s)]
*  State Department official said that even all of the regional allies that the US has been [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=110.72s)]
*  talking about about those plans aren't on the same page. So they can't even really get [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=115.08000000000001s)]
*  they actually solve the fundamentals here, the basic necessity for there to be a ceasefire, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=120.16s)]
*  for hostages to be released. And that even remains a question mark. We've heard from [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=126.64s)]
*  US officials over the last few days after the death of Yahya Sinwar that they really [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=131.72s)]
*  felt that there could be an opportunity here to seize the moment, to bring forth an end [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=136.96s)]
*  to this conflict. But even a senior State Department official on the way over to Israel [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=144.96s)]
*  with Blinken told reporters that the US really doesn't actually know what the next few weeks [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=150.88s)]
*  are going to look like with regard to the future of Gaza, these future potential hostage [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=155.4s)]
*  and ceasefire talks. And fundamentally, one of the reasons for that, this official pointed [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=160.32s)]
*  out, is the fact that the United States doesn't know who's going to lead Hamas and therefore [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=165.56s)]
*  they don't know when negotiations could get underway again. And that is a really big problem. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  It's also interesting that the US had said that the number one impediment was Sinwar [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=175.68s)]
*  and he's gone. So that creates opportunity now that he's gone. Of course, there are more [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=180.84s)]
*  challenges ahead. And the US is also hoping that they can make some progress when it comes [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=185.32s)]
*  to pressuring Israel to allow more aid, to enable more aid to be going into Gaza. But [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=191.84s)]
*  as you said in that opening there, there was a warning call just this morning from [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=198.32s)]
*  the top official of UNRWA with regard to the situation in northern Gaza. And while the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=202.28s)]
*  US has said that there have been some progress that the Israelis have made on this front, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=208.28s)]
*  they haven't made enough. And time is of the essence with this one, particularly because [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=212.72s)]
*  the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken and his counterpart at the Defense Department, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  Secretary Austin, sent a letter to Israel saying that they need to actually make specific [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=223.68s)]
*  steps on this front within 30 days or else face the possibility of reviewing laws in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  the United States that could jeopardize US military support. So this is one that will [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=234.6s)]
*  still will also be focused on coming out of this trip. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=238.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to have you. Thank you. That's Kylie Atwood at the State Department and you [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=242.0s)]
*  are looking at pictures of Antony Blinken arriving in region. Meanwhile, Paula, the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=247.4s)]
*  IDF pounding both Gaza and Beirut and Lebanon. I want to start with Lebanon, where we've [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=253.0s)]
*  seen a strike on one hospital already and we have just heard an ominous warning from [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=259.32s)]
*  the IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari. That was earlier on Monday. Have a listen. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=266.24s)]
*  This is the bunker. It contains rooms, beds and infrastructure for long stays and the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=273.56s)]
*  ability to direct combat from underground. He's Bala build this bunker directly underneath [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=279.68s)]
*  this hospital. There are hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold inside the bunker [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=286.68s)]
*  right now. What are we hearing from Lebanese officials [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=295.48s)]
*  about those allegations? Well, Becky, there's an absolute pushback from [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=304.56s)]
*  Lebanese officials, from the directors within the hospital as well that what Hagari was [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=308.52000000000004s)]
*  saying is accurate. We've heard from one of the directors saying that it's a hospital [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=313.72s)]
*  that's been there for more than 40 years. They have no political affiliation. He's actually [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  been inviting journalists, UN members and Lebanese army into the hospital to try and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=323.46s)]
*  show them that there is no truth to this. One of his quotes is this, the Israeli allegations [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=329.14s)]
*  are baseless and are a pretext to justify attacks on Lebanon and its institutions. He [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=334.85999999999996s)]
*  also goes on to say, though, that they have started to do some kind of evacuations of [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  patients and staff because they're concerned that if the IDF believes that this does house [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=345.32s)]
*  Hezbollah infrastructure, that they will target at least nearby. We have seen that happen [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=351.44s)]
*  with another hospital, the largest public hospital in Beirut. It comes just a day after [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=357.92s)]
*  we're seeing these financial institutions, which the IDF says is affiliated with Hezbollah, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  being targeted as well. There is a real concern within these hospitals. What we're hearing [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=369.44s)]
*  from officials is that this is how it happened in Gaza, that the IDF said this is affiliated [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=376.28s)]
*  with Hamas and then they targeted these hospitals. So there is a very serious pushback from officials [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=382.08s)]
*  in Beirut at the moment. Well, that is Beirut. I want to get to Gaza because we are seeing [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=387.64s)]
*  some pretty horrific images from the north of Gaza where residents have once again been [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=393.59999999999997s)]
*  told to evacuate. These are residents who have actually returned to northern Gaza. What's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=400.68s)]
*  the IDF saying about its targets there? So the IDF actually provided us with some drone [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=407.24s)]
*  footage, which they say proves that they are safely evacuating civilians from out of the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=413.36s)]
*  area. This was Jabalia refugee camps specifically. It's where the Israeli military started an [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=420.16s)]
*  operation more than two weeks ago saying that they believe that Hamas was rebuilding, regrouping [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  and this was where they needed to target them. But there have been thousands of civilians [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=430.32s)]
*  stuck there for days now because they weren't able to evacuate as the military wanted them [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=434.6s)]
*  to. They say that it was simply too dangerous. We're hearing from the Gaza civil defence [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=440.2s)]
*  that some 600 people have been killed just in the past couple of weeks in these areas [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=444.68s)]
*  of northern Gaza. Now they don't give the breakdown of militants versus civilians, but [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=450.64s)]
*  the footage that we are seeing shows a lot of women and children in these hospitals. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=455.2s)]
*  And we're also hearing more concern from the UN on the ground saying that even their workers [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  can't get food, they can't get water, they have been denied the ability to send medical [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=464.64s)]
*  equipment into the few hospitals still working in the area by the Israeli military, something [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=469.76s)]
*  the Israeli military denies. But they say it is an absolutely desperate situation in [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=476.88s)]
*  northern Gaza at the moment. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhSFAV34pX0&t=481.24s)]
