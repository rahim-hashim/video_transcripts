# 'We really thought we were bringing him home': Parents of hostage murdered by Hamas speak out
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08)
*  It's believed that more than 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=0.0s)]
*  Hirsch Goldberg-Polin was kidnapped on October 7th. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=4.2s)]
*  I first learned about him a few days afterward, when an IDF soldier showed me this video of [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=7.48s)]
*  a young man being loaded into a pickup truck. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=12.6s)]
*  His hand had been blown off. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=14.92s)]
*  I didn't know it was Hirsch, who was Israeli-American, until a few days later when I happened to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=17.36s)]
*  interview his parents. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=21.72s)]
*  At the time, they were unaware the video existed, and they didn't even know if he was alive. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  I called them after the interview to tell them what I'd seen, and I sent them the video. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  Since then, I've spoken to Hirsch's parents a number of times. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=33.04s)]
*  In April, a propaganda video was released by Hamas showing Hirsch. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=36.599999999999994s)]
*  He urged his family to stay strong and gave proof that he was alive. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=40.8s)]
*  But at the beginning of September, the Israeli military said they recovered the bodies of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=45.04s)]
*  six hostages who were murdered by Hamas, including Hirsch's. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=48.14s)]
*  Earlier today, for the first time since his death, I spoke with his parents, Rachel and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  John. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=56.16s)]
*  John and Rachel, thank you so much for talking with me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=58.44s)]
*  It's been a month and a half since you learned the news that Hirsch had been killed, along [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=62.4s)]
*  with other hostages. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  What's the last month and a half been like for you? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think anybody who suffers a trauma, a loss, has some sense of what we're going [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=75.4s)]
*  through. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=85.72s)]
*  I'm not trying to compare us to anybody else in trauma, but what is different here is, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=87.44s)]
*  as you know well, Anderson, for 330 days, we were on a global campaign to save the life [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=94.52s)]
*  of Hirsch and other hostages. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  We knew that they were suffering. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=104.12s)]
*  We knew that they were being held in terrible conditions. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=106.0s)]
*  We could talk more about that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=108.2s)]
*  But we were on a mission all day, every day. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  And we believed our own optimism. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=114.0s)]
*  We really thought, we are bringing him home. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=117.26s)]
*  We looked forward, Anderson, to you meeting Hirsch. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=119.9s)]
*  And to get the news on August 31st that they found six bodies, including Hirsch's, was [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=123.18s)]
*  just such a crushing blow. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=131.5s)]
*  And we are still grappling with it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=134.62s)]
*  We are oddly blessed because there are hostage families who know that their loved ones were [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=138.62s)]
*  killed and their bodies are still being held. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=144.98s)]
*  And they were not able to give them, at least yet, a proper respectful burial. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  So we're grateful that we got Hirsch's body and that we were able to give him that respect. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=152.78s)]
*  But it's crushing to spend those days so optimistic, so hopeful, so focused to have an end like [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=159.78s)]
*  this. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=169.22s)]
*  I imagine meeting him as well. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=171.58s)]
*  And I imagine him getting on a plane on December 27th of this year, which he was supposed to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=173.62s)]
*  do December 27th last year for a trip to India. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  And I imagined all of that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=184.18s)]
*  I'm stunned. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=190.94s)]
*  I guess, not surprised, but stunned and just so saddened for your loss and the loss of [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=191.94s)]
*  so many. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=199.14s)]
*  Rachel, for you, what has this been like? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=200.7s)]
*  Well, I think that in order to get through the 11 months before day 330, I was using [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=205.14s)]
*  so much psychological suppression in order to function. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=218.14s)]
*  There was so much trauma and terror that we were experiencing as parents of someone there [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=224.18s)]
*  that I was shoving all of this emotion and fear and terror in, I like to think of it [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=231.86s)]
*  as, you know, suitcases and shoving those suitcases into a room and not dealing with [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=242.86s)]
*  that because we were in battle. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  We were on a mission. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=251.22s)]
*  And in order to function, I had to suppress so much. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  So I don't want to look back at those 11 months. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=257.86s)]
*  I don't want to unpack those suitcases. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=261.62s)]
*  I also don't want to look ahead at what does life look like without Hirsch in it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=264.18s)]
*  So I'm kind of trapped in this very immediate present. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=272.54s)]
*  And I'm just trying to get through each day. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=279.02s)]
*  I think we are in the first centimeter of a million mile journey of how do we get through [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=282.54s)]
*  the rest of our lives, yearning and missing our son. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=292.62s)]
*  I was looking at the calendar. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=298.66s)]
*  It's been, it was October 16th last year that you and I spoke for the first time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  Today's October 14th. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=305.46000000000004s)]
*  And I really meant what I said. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=306.86s)]
*  I really, really expected him to come home. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we did too. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  We spent so much time beyond our public campaign in our apartment with our two daughters, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=322.58s)]
*  literally planning what it was going to be when we brought them home. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  What would the family look like? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  What would the celebration look like? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=335.98s)]
*  What kind of tone would it have? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=340.66s)]
*  Like we were getting into those details. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, we've said this elsewhere, but maybe our optimism was something that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=345.1s)]
*  drove influencers to lack urgency, you know, to feel like he's going to come home at some [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=355.90000000000003s)]
*  point somehow. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=364.06s)]
*  And maybe it was too infectious and it just, it made them the urgency that they needed. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=365.74s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=373.22s)]
*  I really feel blessed that I was Hershey's mom for as long as I was. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=374.42s)]
*  And although obviously this is the first, you know, moments in this lifetime of how [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=379.82s)]
*  do you live with something that's really big and painful and not let it sort of drown you? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=390.82s)]
*  I really, we've really made the choice that we really would like to not just exist, but [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=400.1s)]
*  we want to live. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=406.26s)]
*  We want to live for our girls. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=407.26s)]
*  And the truth is, I want to live for Hershey. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=409.82s)]
*  I want to live the life that Hershey should have lived. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=413.02s)]
*  And that's a life filled with, you know, love and happiness and light. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=415.90000000000003s)]
*  And we will always have this deep, you know, sort of void. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=421.98s)]
*  But I think that it's still possible to have that void and to be happy and choose life. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=430.66s)]
*  I do think that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=439.62s)]
*  I was talking to my daughters about it today and we spoke to Yoni Levy about that the other [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=441.38s)]
*  day. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=446.78s)]
*  We said, I said on her unholy podcast that people walked out of Auschwitz and they went [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=447.78s)]
*  on to have good lives. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  And some people walked out of Auschwitz and they never left Auschwitz. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=456.98s)]
*  You know, we had a weird thing, Anderson, where last year, Saturday night, October 7th, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=463.82s)]
*  midnight, I walked in from the police station where I had been dropping off DNA samples. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=470.74s)]
*  And remember, that Saturday night, we assumed Hershey was dead. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  And we had the chance to sit in our room and cry and talk and say, then, if he's dead, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=480.74s)]
*  we're going to mourn, we're going to grieve, but we have to live life eventually for ourselves, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=488.18s)]
*  for our girls and for Hershey. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=495.3s)]
*  And then in an eerie way, we had the exact same conversation on Sunday, September 1st, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=497.46s)]
*  331 days later. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=503.3s)]
*  330 days in between of optimism and hope. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhiOsf6uk08&t=507.14s)]
