# Deadly drone attack by Hezbollah exposes Israelâ€™s weaknesses
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I)
*  Israel keeps up its airstrikes on Gaza and Lebanon as a Hezbollah drone attack hits an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=0.0s)]
*  army base deep inside Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=5.0s)]
*  I begin with the escalating developments in the Middle East at this hour as the U.S. is [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=7.2s)]
*  stepping up its help for Israel ahead of an expected retaliatory attack by Israel on Iran. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=11.36s)]
*  Israel turned its fire on a mostly Christian village north of Beirut today. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=17.56s)]
*  Lebanon's health ministry says at least 19 people were killed in that airstrike. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=21.56s)]
*  Across the border, a Hezbollah drone penetrated Israel's defenses to launch an attack on an [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=26.2s)]
*  Israeli army base Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=30.68s)]
*  Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant visited the base and vowed to investigate how the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  drone got into Israeli airspace undetected. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=40.22s)]
*  The U.S. is sending an advanced anti-missile system to Israel to bolster the country's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=43.64s)]
*  defense against attacks, along with about 100 U.S. troops to operate it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=48.2s)]
*  Certainly a rare move for U.S. troops to be deployed inside Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=53.16s)]
*  Meantime in Gaza, officials say four people were killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=57.32s)]
*  airstrike on a hospital compound where displaced Palestinians were sheltering. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=61.24s)]
*  CNN reporters are covering this story from all angles. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=65.64s)]
*  Ben Wideman is in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=68.12s)]
*  Nick Robertson is in Jerusalem for us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=70.28s)]
*  And our Orn Lieberman joins us from the Pentagon. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=72.32s)]
*  Let's begin with CNN's Nick Robertson. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=74.48s)]
*  Big escalation over the weekend with that drone attack, as we just mentioned. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=77.08s)]
*  And there were air raid warnings just moments ago, Nick, in Tel Aviv itself. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=81.4s)]
*  The military saying that it intercepted three launches from Lebanon. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  Tell us more about what we're hearing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=91.2s)]
*  Yeah, that strike that hit an IDF base about 30 miles north of Tel Aviv, 40 miles south [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=93.2s)]
*  of the border with Lebanon, is significant because it appears to be the first time that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=100.88s)]
*  Hezbollah has been able to actually target, and it certainly appears and said it was targeting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=105.64s)]
*  an IDF base and has said in recent days that that's what it was planning to do. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=110.8s)]
*  It is significant as well because it seems to be, appears to be the bloodiest strike [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  on troops here since October 7th, certainly away from the combat lines, and really exposes [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=121.36s)]
*  the difficulty, if you will, that the IDF faces maintaining a thorough ability to deter [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  every missile and every drone that comes from Hezbollah in the north. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=137.04s)]
*  They managed to sort of whittle away and limit the missiles coming from Hamas in Gaza in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=142.88s)]
*  the south. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=148.92s)]
*  But every day there's an average of about 150 or so missiles and drones that come in [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=149.92s)]
*  from Lebanon. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=155.88s)]
*  And what the IDF said was that they were tracking drones coming in around about suppertime [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=156.88s)]
*  yesterday, 7 p.m. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=161.36s)]
*  They got one drone as it came over the border, but they lost sight of another. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think, you know, there's perhaps a significant comparison to be made here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=169.12s)]
*  If I throw back to the British and their fight with the IRA, Irish Republican Army in Northern [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=173.56s)]
*  Ireland, who tried to blow up the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 80s, put a bomb in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  her hotel, and their message to her afterwards, while she survived, some of her fellow colleagues [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=183.76s)]
*  didn't, the message to her was, we only have to be lucky once. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=190.56s)]
*  You have to be lucky every time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=195.04s)]
*  And this really could be a case of that, that Hezbollah, they'd been trying to do this for [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=196.52s)]
*  a while. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=200.4s)]
*  They got lucky. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=201.4s)]
*  And that's the difficulty of a long war like this, that Israel has to not only be lucky, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=202.52s)]
*  but continue its professional ability to see every threat and stop it coming. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=207.52s)]
*  Yeah, that drone attack against the army base did not set off alarm signals in the country. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=212.24s)]
*  And thus, the troops were eating at the time that it struck. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  We've covered drone warfare quite thoroughly as we've been covering the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=223.48s)]
*  But now, obviously, this is a subject that we're broaching as it relates to the Middle [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  East as well. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=232.62s)]
*  Nick Robertson, thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=233.62s)]
*  Let's bring in Ben Wiedemann, who joins us live now from Beirut. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=234.62s)]
*  So Ben, we're seeing a Christian town in the north being targeted, so clearly not just [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah strongholds. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Walk us through what that says about the expanding parameters of this war. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=246.28s)]
*  Yes, the target in this case, Zayn, was an apartment building, a residential building [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=251.24s)]
*  in the village of Aytu in the Zgharta region, which is really the Christian heartland. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=259.04s)]
*  Now, we spoke to the mayor of that town, who told us that he lives about two, two-and-a-half [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=264.48s)]
*  kilometers away, and he thought the blast happened right next door. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=269.92s)]
*  He said that this building was home to people who had been displaced from other parts of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=276.2s)]
*  Lebanon, families basically, including women and children. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=281.88s)]
*  He said he had no knowledge of any fighters being in the building or any weapons being [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  stored now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=292.36s)]
*  Now, it's the Lebanese Red Cross Society that is saying that the death toll is at least [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=293.36s)]
*  9,999 injured, but they continue to dig in the rubble because it's believed there's still [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=300.0s)]
*  people alive, perhaps, underneath. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=306.12s)]
*  Now, it is significant because this is a village that's about 100 kilometers north of Beirut [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=309.04s)]
*  in an area that normally wouldn't be targeted by the Israelis. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=315.88s)]
*  It's not clear at this point what the potential target was, but it certainly represents a [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=321.08s)]
*  change, and it certainly underscores that Israel will hit anywhere in the country. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=327.16s)]
*  They have hit further north in Lebanon, but a majority Christian area. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=333.52s)]
*  This is absolutely the first time this has happened. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=339.64s)]
*  At the same time, the Israelis are issuing more evacuation orders this morning for more [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=342.8s)]
*  than 20 villages in the south, and among the list of so-called villages is the city of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=347.96s)]
*  which has a population in normal times of more than 100,000. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=354.44s)]
*  At this point, about a quarter of Lebanon is under these Israeli evacuation orders, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=360.16s)]
*  which come out, new ones every single day. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=366.76000000000005s)]
*  We're talking about, at this point, well over 160 towns, villages, and now cities that have [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=369.28000000000003s)]
*  received these evacuation orders. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=376.24s)]
*  Zeyn? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, when you have that many evacuation orders covering so much of Lebanon, I mean, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=379.32s)]
*  the big question is where do people go? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  Where is actually safe right now? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  I'd better be there in life for us there. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  All right, let's get right to the Pentagon and CNN's Oren Lieberman. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  Oren, let's talk about this news about the U.S. sending a THAAD system to Israel as we [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=392.64s)]
*  are anticipating Israel's response to the unprecedented, nearly 200 ballistic missiles [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  launched at its last two weeks ago by Iran. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=405.2s)]
*  Now we're expecting Israel to respond, and thus perhaps a retaliatory response then from [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=409.52s)]
*  Iran. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=415.12s)]
*  Talk about the significance of this very powerful anti-missile system and the fact that coming [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=416.12s)]
*  with it will be about 100 U.S. troops as well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=421.88s)]
*  The THAAD system, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, is perhaps the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  most capable anti-ballistic missile system the U.S. has, able to intercept short-range, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=429.84s)]
*  medium-range, and long-range ballistic missile during its final dive or terminal phase towards [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=434.6s)]
*  its target. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=440.08s)]
*  It can intercept those missiles at a range of about 100 miles or more and can detect [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=441.08s)]
*  them much farther out than that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=444.92s)]
*  On top of that, it's capable of working with and collaborating with, interfacing with, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=446.5s)]
*  if you will, the Navy destroyers that are in the region and Israeli missile defense [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=451.2s)]
*  systems as well. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=454.96s)]
*  So it adds quality and, crucially, quantity to Israel's layered aerial defense system. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=456.4s)]
*  It's short-range Iron Dome, medium-range David Sling, and then the long-range Arrow system. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=461.98s)]
*  Crucially, the U.S. doesn't have that many THAAD systems, so any time one is moved or [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=467.38s)]
*  deployed, it is a significant statement first on the commitment of U.S. forces, and there [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=471.78000000000003s)]
*  are about 100 troops that are required to operate the THAAD system, and then on where [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=476.98s)]
*  the U.S. sees its priority, because to put a THAAD in one place means you don't have [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=481.42s)]
*  it somewhere else. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=486.1s)]
*  THAAD was deployed to the Middle East after the October 7th terror attack. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=487.66s)]
*  Now it's being moved specifically to Israel, and you point out exactly why it's there. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=491.7s)]
*  After the October 1st launch of some 180-plus Iranian ballistic missiles against Israel, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=496.38s)]
*  Israel has very much vowed to respond, and in response to that, Iran has promised its [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=501.9s)]
*  own retaliation. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=506.38s)]
*  And if it's another large-scale barrage, as we've seen on October 1st and on April 13th, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=507.73999999999995s)]
*  THAAD could play a crucial role there, and that's very much why it's there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=512.9399999999999s)]
*  Aside from the military aspect of it, there is also that message that the U.S. will absolutely [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt4g41ex9-I&t=517.74s)]
