# CNN correspondent breaks down new IDF report on WCK strike
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE)
*  We've just received the IDF's initial findings on the Israeli strike that killed seven World [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=0.0s)]
*  Central kitchen workers in Gaza on Monday. The internal investigation has found Israeli forces [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=5.2s)]
*  believe they were targeting Hamas and quote mistakenly assumed to Hamas gunmen were in the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=11.44s)]
*  vehicles in the aid convoy. Israel has now fired two military commanders. Let's get right to CNN's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=17.76s)]
*  Nick Robertson who joins us now live from Jerusalem. Can you walk us through the findings? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  It's a couple of pages and what do you see that might be missing when you look at some of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=28.88s)]
*  details of this? Yeah sure this is a sequence of events that the IDF has laid out that they say [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=34.4s)]
*  led to this misidentification and misclarification of the events on the ground. They say the IDF [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=42.0s)]
*  spotted a gunman getting on aid trucks. We're talking about trucks here the big vehicles [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=47.92s)]
*  that carry the actual pallets and containers of food and other humanitarian supplies and then [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=54.8s)]
*  the IDF says they saw another gunman again a single so we're talking about two gunmen they're [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  saying they see get on the aid truck or aid trucks. Then the convoy goes into the warehouse and the IDF [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  says what happened next is where the misidentification and misclarification happens. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=75.44s)]
*  That the IDF then tracked the SUVs the vehicles leaving the warehouse after the aid trucks had [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=81.76s)]
*  been there. The IDF says they didn't realize these SUVs were for the world central kitchen [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  despite the fact these were markings are clearly emblazoned on those vehicles. The IDF then says [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=97.2s)]
*  that those vehicles were engaged because the IDF believed that the gunman were inside those SUVs [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  no longer on the aid trucks after they've been to the warehouse but inside the SUVs. Now the IDF says [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  this should not have happened it was against their protocols and against their rules of engagement [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  and they have now dismissed a major who was directly involved in the incident and the brigade [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=124.16s)]
*  chief of staff a reserve colonel and disciplined the brigade commander as well. Now the world [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=130.72s)]
*  central kitchen say that it is good that the IDF has acknowledged and accepted responsibility. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=137.84s)]
*  It's good that they have taken disciplinary action however they're saying that this is [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=146.4s)]
*  these outrageous killings that what the IDF has said so far and what they've done is really of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=154.0s)]
*  cold comfort. They said that the IDF report shows that the world central kitchen workers were doing [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=160.56s)]
*  everything that they should have been doing but this of course leaves many many questions unanswered. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=167.04s)]
*  How could it be assumed that the gunman who've been on trucks were now inside and we're talking [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=175.44s)]
*  about two gunmen could be inside three different vehicles and so many more unanswered questions. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=180.48s)]
*  Yeah that's true we will wait to see what happens. I know the world central kitchen [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=186.64s)]
*  founder has asked for an independent investigation that is not done by the IDF. I do want to talk to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=190.88s)]
*  you about something that has just happened you know after this conversation between Netanyahu [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=195.52s)]
*  and President Biden the aid crossings into northern Gaza opening up and a dedicated port Israel says [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  will be available for aid shipments. What else are you learning there? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah I think it's kind of key to look at what the White House is saying here. U.S. policy is going [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=214.56s)]
*  to be determined on how Israel moves forward from these statements and we heard the same from [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=218.4s)]
*  Secretary Blinken today and it's what Palestinians are telling us as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=222.96s)]
*  It's one thing to hear it from the Israeli government particularly when they're pushed by [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=227.36s)]
*  the United States to do this but let's see the reality on the ground and the context of that of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  course is that back in January this year the Israeli government said that it was okay for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=234.88s)]
*  food shipments to come in through the port of Ashdod which is 20 miles from the Erez crossing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=240.96s)]
*  However those food shipments when they arrived were then blocked by protesters. We already know [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=246.96s)]
*  that elements within Netanyahu's Prime Minister Netanyahu's government the right-wing elements [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=252.72s)]
*  are saying that they didn't agree with this move by the Israeli government. This sets the scene for [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=257.76s)]
*  again potential protests to potentially stop convoys. It hasn't happened but this is why the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=262.88s)]
*  White House will look closely and another point of reference here is that when he was here [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=268.24s)]
*  in early February Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Israelis that they should be opening [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=272.72s)]
*  the Erez crossing in the north of Gaza because that's where the humanitarian situation is most [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=277.2s)]
*  desperate. That's where people are literally dying of starvation. We just got a figure [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=281.28s)]
*  from people on the ground there today. You know how much it is for one kilo 2.2 pounds of potatoes [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=285.28s)]
*  today? 22 bucks 22 bucks for two pounds of potatoes. That's the price of potatoes. That's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  why people are starving in the in the north of Gaza right now and that's why there's going to be [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=298.15999999999997s)]
*  so much scrutiny to see if this actually happens that the US has called so many times for Erez to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=303.2s)]
*  be opened. Yeah. Yeah and the UN agency that's looking at famine says famine is imminent [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=309.36s)]
*  there. A man-made famine. Nick Robertson thank you so much for all your reporting. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Okay so this report also comes out as Israel is now as you guys were just discussing opening [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  planning to open another crossing into Gaza to allow more humanitarian aid to flow in and this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=326.32s)]
*  is after that phone call between President Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister where Biden issued [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=331.12s)]
*  an ultimatum that Netanyahu takes specific and concrete and measurable steps to protect aid workers [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=336.32s)]
*  to or risk losing US support. CNS Arlette Science is at the White House now with much more on on this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=342.88s)]
*  Arlette what are you hearing this morning from the White House about this initial review, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=349.04s)]
*  this initial analysis, this initial report coming out about that strike? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=354.48s)]
*  Well Kate, officials here at the White House were closely waiting and watching for this initial [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=359.52s)]
*  report from the Israelis as they're trying to get some further explanation for what exactly [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=364.48s)]
*  led to that strike on that World Central Kitchen convoy. It comes on the heels of a very blunt [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=368.72s)]
*  conversation between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday where [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=374.0s)]
*  Biden warned Israel would face consequences if they do not do more to protect civilians [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=378.88s)]
*  and ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Now in that phone call a senior administration official [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  tells CNN that Netanyahu admitted that the IDF was to blame for the strike on this convoy and [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=389.2s)]
*  this morning we have some interesting new language from Secretary of State Antony Blinken who ahead [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=395.52s)]
*  of the Israelis report being released said that there must be a thorough independent investigation [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  and full accountability for what happened. Take a listen. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  It's also critical that we see an independent, thorough, and fully publicized investigation [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=408.56s)]
*  into the killing of the World Central Kitchen [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  team who were performing heroic work under the most difficult circumstances and trying to get [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=424.32s)]
*  assistance to people who so desperately need it. So we're looking to see that investigation, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=430.8s)]
*  we're looking to see a public accounting, and we're looking to see accountability in its wake. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=435.44s)]
*  Now this all comes on the heels of what was could be one of the most consequential phone calls of [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=443.68s)]
*  this conflict between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In that phone [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=448.72s)]
*  call Netanyahu assured the president that Israel would be trying to take steps to prevent incidents [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  like this from happening again. That's according to a senior administration official. One thing [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=460.08s)]
*  that the two men agreed on was that more needed to be done to be able to track where these [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=464.08s)]
*  humanitarian aid workers are in Gaza. There also was a discussion about the need to get more [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=469.28s)]
*  humanitarian aid into the enclave and that was through the opening of these access points. As [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=474.56s)]
*  Nick was talking about earlier, just in the hours after this call between Biden and Netanyahu, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=480.08s)]
*  Israel approved the opening of that era's crossing in northern Gaza. Now one thing that Secretary [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=484.96s)]
*  Blinken and other officials here at the White House have stressed is that while they welcome [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=490.96s)]
*  the opening of this crossing, while they welcome the ports, they also want to see the metrics of [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=495.76s)]
*  this, see how many aid trucks are actually getting in, see how much assistance is actually being [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=502.32s)]
*  distributed to the Palestinian people. But really this call between Biden and Netanyahu will be [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=506.88s)]
*  closely watched since it was one of the starkest warnings that he's offered that Biden has given [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=513.52s)]
*  to Netanyahu about the way that they're conducting their operations, saying that things need to change. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=518.24s)]
*  Arlette Sines at the White House. Thank you so much, Arlette. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhpWPuYaRTE&t=523.36s)]
