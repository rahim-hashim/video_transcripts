Video Description: Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians began returning home to northern Gaza, bracing for what awaits them in a region that has been reduced to rubble by months of brutal bombardment and fighting. President Donald Trump indicated that he had spoken with the king of Jordan about potentially building housing and moving more than 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries, a remarkable proposal from a sitting US president. #CNN #News

# Egypt and Jordan reject Trumpâ€™s idea to take in more Palestinians
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc)
*  They have been waiting as well as praying for this moment for months. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=0.0s)]
*  Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians are returning [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=4.24s)]
*  to their demolished neighborhoods in northern Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  As you can see, the images, really moving images captured in this drone video [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=10.44s)]
*  convey really the size of the crowds making their way in waves [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=14.56s)]
*  along the coast of Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=18.6s)]
*  This was meant to happen on Saturday, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=20.76s)]
*  but they were kept waiting for another 48 hours [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=23.2s)]
*  after Israel accused Hamas of breaching the terms of the ceasefire. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=26.36s)]
*  Hamas and Israel later agreed to release more hostages. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=30.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, a startling idea floated by Donald Trump is raising alarm. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=34.0s)]
*  The US president said he would like Jordan and Egypt [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  to take in more Palestinians, suggesting Gaza, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=42.24s)]
*  which lies in ruins, as we just showed you, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=44.68s)]
*  needs to be, in his words, cleaned out. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=47.2s)]
*  Jordanian and Egyptian authorities swiftly reject the idea, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=50.32s)]
*  saying it would amount to displacing Palestinians from their homeland. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=54.68s)]
*  Palestinians and human rights groups also condemn Mr Trump's remark, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=58.2s)]
*  although a leading far-right figure, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=62.32s)]
*  Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has welcomed the proposal. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Our Jeremy Diamond has more now from Tel Aviv for you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=68.72s)]
*  Well, a checkpoint to northern Gaza was finally opened early this morning, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  and tens of thousands of Palestinians who lived in northern Gaza [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=77.16s)]
*  and have been displaced for months now [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=81.16s)]
*  finally beginning to make their way back home. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=82.88000000000001s)]
*  It is an emotional journey for many, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=86.16s)]
*  as we have seen people carrying all of their belongings [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=88.16s)]
*  with them in their hands on donkey carts or piling into buses [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=91.48s)]
*  to try and make their way to northern Gaza [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=95.72s)]
*  after so many months of displacement. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  What they are finding there, of course, is an enormous level of destruction, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=100.68s)]
*  perhaps more than anywhere else in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=104.84s)]
*  But one after the other, the people who are returning home [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=108.08000000000001s)]
*  expressed their desire to go back, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=111.84s)]
*  no matter what the conditions on the ground there, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=113.52s)]
*  expressing their connection to their homes in northern Gaza. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  They were only allowed to return to northern Gaza [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=120.88s)]
*  after a nearly 48-hour delay [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=123.0s)]
*  when they were initially supposed to be allowed to return north [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=126.0s)]
*  based on the ceasefire agreement. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=128.92s)]
*  That was after there was a dispute between Israel and Hamas [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=130.68s)]
*  over the release of one of the Israeli hostages, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=133.92s)]
*  who Israel expected to be released this past Saturday. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=136.6s)]
*  Instead, a female civilian hostage named Arbel Yehud was not released. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  Four female soldiers were released instead. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  And Israel demanded that she be released in order to move forward [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=149.64s)]
*  with this part of the agreement regarding the return of Gazans [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  to the northern part of the Strip. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=157.11999999999998s)]
*  Arbel Yehud is indeed now expected to be released on Thursday. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=159.2s)]
*  And with that agreement in place, Israel opened that checkpoint [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  to allow Gazans to return to that part of the Strip. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=166.2s)]
*  But as we are watching these images of people returning [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=169.67999999999998s)]
*  to this devastated section of the Gaza Strip, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=173.32s)]
*  we are also now hearing comments from President Trump [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=176.04s)]
*  calling for the mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  for them to be moved to Egypt and Jordan, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=182.67999999999998s)]
*  and saying that Gaza needs to be cleaned out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  And we just clean out that whole thing. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  It's, you know, it's over the centuries, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=190.67999999999998s)]
*  it's had many, many conflicts at site. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=192.92s)]
*  And I don't know, it's something has to happen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=196.27999999999997s)]
*  But it's literally a demolition site right now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=198.4s)]
*  Almost everything's demolished. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=203.4s)]
*  And President Trump says that he wants Egypt and Jordan [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=205.4s)]
*  to be a safe harbor for these Palestinians. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=207.68s)]
*  But this has rings of notions of mass displacement [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=209.84s)]
*  that, of course, are triggering for many Palestinians [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=213.28s)]
*  who have suffered displacements over decades and decades [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=216.68s)]
*  in Israel and the Palestinian territories. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=220.28s)]
*  And it's also a notion that's already been rejected [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=222.6s)]
*  by both Egypt and Jordan. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=224.72s)]
*  As the Jordanian foreign minister says that Palestine [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=226.28s)]
*  is for Palestinians and Jordan is for Jordanians [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=230.2s)]
*  rejecting any notions of mass displacement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=233.24s)]
*  We should also note that these ideas being spawned by Trump [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=235.64s)]
*  already have drawn a lot of favor here in Israel [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=238.84s)]
*  from right-wing ministers in the Israeli government [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=242.04s)]
*  who have talked about, quote, voluntary emigration [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=245.76s)]
*  for many, many months now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=249.0s)]
*  Those ideas, though, being soundly rejected in the region, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=250.6s)]
*  not clear what the path forward is for President Trump [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=253.72s)]
*  and his administration towards making that a reality. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=255.96s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=259.04s)]
*  And now thanks to Jeremy for that report. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=262.2s)]
*  Meanwhile, the United States says a separate ceasefire [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=264.0s)]
*  agreement between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=266.6s)]
*  will be extended by three weeks to February 18. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=269.16s)]
*  Lebanese officials said Israeli forces killed at least 22 people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=272.76s)]
*  and injured dozens more in southern Lebanon on Sunday. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=276.44s)]
*  And it came as thousands of people [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=280.2s)]
*  tried to return to their homes defying an order [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=281.6s)]
*  by the Israeli military not to go back. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=284.44s)]
*  Israel, said Freize, its forces will not withdraw [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=286.88s)]
*  as initially agreed, blaming Lebanon for failing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=289.56s)]
*  to comply with the deal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=291.96s)]
*  For more on all these very fast-moving developments [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=293.84s)]
*  and all these strands, I want to bring in Firas Miksad. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  He's a senior director and a senior fellow [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=298.88s)]
*  at the Middle East Institute and joins us from Washington, DC. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=300.64s)]
*  Firas, great to have you back on the show. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=303.4s)]
*  We'll speak about Lebanon in just a second, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=305.64s)]
*  but I really want to pick up with what we heard [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  from our Jeremy Diamond, really, in Tel Aviv. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=310.67999999999995s)]
*  And those comments by President Trump [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=314.24s)]
*  of cleaning out the whole thing, speaking of the enclave. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=316.76s)]
*  I mean, this is pretty alarming. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=320.44s)]
*  Just frame this for us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  Is this a slip of the tongue, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=323.64s)]
*  or do you fear this is future US policy? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=325.56s)]
*  Thank you, Yilla. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=330.48s)]
*  Yeah, I actually recently just came back [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  from meetings with senior officials in Jordan. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=333.24s)]
*  And I could tell you, even when it comes to the Egyptians, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=336.4s)]
*  that what President Trump is insinuating [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=338.64s)]
*  is simply not on the table and a non-starter. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=341.16s)]
*  It touches on the very national security of both countries. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=344.72s)]
*  In Jordan's case, almost some 60% of the population [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  is believed to be of Palestinian origin. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=352.76000000000005s)]
*  It's a very tight balancing act [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=354.72s)]
*  between those of Palestinian origins and those who are not. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=357.16s)]
*  But the Jordanian monarchy just will simply not accept this, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=361.36s)]
*  despite the considerable leverage that President Trump has [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=364.92s)]
*  in trying to bring about this transfer [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=368.24s)]
*  of Palestinians from Gaza. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=370.28s)]
*  This is in addition to the fact that the idea [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=372.28s)]
*  of transferring Palestinians out of their land [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=375.23999999999995s)]
*  is a very sensitive issue for Palestinians [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=377.76s)]
*  and part of the Palestinian national trauma and narrative. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=381.47999999999996s)]
*  So we've seen President Trump make some comments [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=385.35999999999996s)]
*  like that before in his first term. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=388.52s)]
*  He mentioned withdrawing from Syria on a phone call [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  with the Turkish president, had to eventually walk it back, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=393.2s)]
*  given pushback from within his administration. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if something like that happens [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=399.32s)]
*  in the weeks down the road. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=401.44s)]
*  Yeah, and look, we've heard from Dr. Hanan Ashwari, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  famous, of course, famed Palestinian activist, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  scholar, politician as well, and she says, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=410.84s)]
*  note to President Trump, this is on X, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=413.0s)]
*  Palestine, including Gaza, the West Bank in Jerusalem [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=415.2s)]
*  is the land of the Palestinian people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=417.84s)]
*  It's where they live and where they belong. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  They're not pawns, she says, in a chess game. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=421.08s)]
*  To ethnically cleanse them is not only inhuman [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=423.4s)]
*  and a war crime, but it also presents a dangerous threat [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=425.55999999999995s)]
*  to the stability of the whole region [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=428.36s)]
*  and to the sovereignty of neighboring states. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=430.0s)]
*  That's how to start wars, not end them. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=432.24s)]
*  So let me pick up really with what you got [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  when you were out in the Middle East, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  because as we well know, the US gave significant amounts [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=440.0s)]
*  of aid to Egypt and to Jordan. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=445.36s)]
*  Could Trump, who as we've seen, as we well know for us, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  is a very transactional president, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=450.28s)]
*  could he pull this aid if countries continue [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=452.4s)]
*  to refuse taking them Palestinians? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=455.8s)]
*  Well, at this point, Ilah, President Trump [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=459.32s)]
*  has given a directive to stop all foreign aid, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=461.52s)]
*  all foreign US aid, with the exception of Egypt and Israel [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=464.28s)]
*  because of that crucial peace treaty [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  that's been in place since 1979, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=470.8s)]
*  and in many ways which the US underwrites. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=473.2s)]
*  Jordan, the US assistance to Jordan is a lifeline, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=475.64s)]
*  and so there will be serious questions if, in fact, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  President Trump wants to bring that leverage to bear [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=483.64s)]
*  to try and force Jordan to take on more Palestinians, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=486.4s)]
*  whether Jordan can survive by finding means of aid elsewhere [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=490.35999999999996s)]
*  in the region, particularly the rich Gulf states, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and others. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=498.59999999999997s)]
*  But this is no doubt a difficult, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=501.12s)]
*  a very difficult position for perhaps [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=502.88s)]
*  America's leading Arab ally to find itself in, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=504.88s)]
*  and yes, President Trump is gonna try to push for that. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=509.12s)]
*  The big question here is whether there will be [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=512.68s)]
*  a counter push in the other direction [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=514.72s)]
*  from many quarters within his administration [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=516.9200000000001s)]
*  to caution against such a move. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=519.52s)]
*  Yeah, look, we've already heard, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  and our correspondent was mentioning this, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=524.32s)]
*  that Bezalel Smokritz, the far-right finance minister, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=526.64s)]
*  is already endorsing his proposal, saying, quote, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=529.84s)]
*  "'There is no doubt in the long run encouraging migration [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  "'is the only solution that will bring peace and security [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  "'to the residents of Israel [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=538.08s)]
*  "'and alleviate the suffering of Gaza's Arab residents.'" [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=539.64s)]
*  And then he basically went on to say [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=542.2s)]
*  he's working on a plan to implement Trump's vision. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=543.4399999999999s)]
*  But I want to tap into your expertise yet again [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=545.84s)]
*  for us in the region. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=549.12s)]
*  How does this complicate then the relationship, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=550.12s)]
*  the negotiations with the Saudis, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=553.84s)]
*  who have themselves called [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=556.1999999999999s)]
*  for an independent Palestinian state? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=557.52s)]
*  I mean, what is Saudi Arabia's role here? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=559.48s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't be at all surprised [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=563.76s)]
*  if there are some who question whether Trump's idea [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=565.56s)]
*  of a transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza to Egypt [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=569.04s)]
*  and then Jordan is part and parcel of his attempt [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=573.88s)]
*  at achieving normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=576.88s)]
*  Essentially, he's throwing some red meat [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=580.56s)]
*  to the more radical elements [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=583.4s)]
*  that are far right in Israeli society [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=585.12s)]
*  that then perhaps say, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=587.68s)]
*  then in return you need to move with me [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=589.28s)]
*  on the issue of Palestinians [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=591.6s)]
*  so that we can get to a normalization with Saudi Arabia. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=593.16s)]
*  If, in fact, in Trump world, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=596.1999999999999s)]
*  this is something that they are conjuring, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=598.4s)]
*  I think it's a non-starter. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=600.36s)]
*  If anything, the Saudis have only hardened their position [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=602.16s)]
*  on the issue of Palestinian rights [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=606.1999999999999s)]
*  because of the backfire of the past year [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=608.8399999999999s)]
*  and three months of horrific images playing out [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=613.28s)]
*  on their television screens [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=616.6s)]
*  and the impact that that has on Saudi [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  and Arab public opinion. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  So again, I see this as perhaps [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=622.36s)]
*  not a fully thought through proposition [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=624.4s)]
*  by the Trump administration that eventually [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=627.0799999999999s)]
*  one would hope they would have to walk back, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=629.6s)]
*  but no doubt President Trump is very focused [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=631.76s)]
*  on the big picture of trying to get normalization [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=634.8s)]
*  between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  That's just not the way to get there. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-i1W-2Z2gc&t=640.16s)]
