# Netanyahu says one reason for ceasefire is because he's waiting on more weapons
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s)
*  CNN breaking news. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is about to speak. I want [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=0.0s)]
*  us to listen in. The war will not finish until we reach all of its goals, including the residents [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=8.32s)]
*  of the north. I'd like to tell you, it will happen exactly as it happened in the south. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=18.92s)]
*  My friends, residents of the north, I'm proud of you. I'm proud of your way you stand, and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=29.52s)]
*  I'm responsible to your future, to your recovery of your settlements. Until now, due to the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=38.28s)]
*  the police, the Shin Bet, and the Mossad, we reached huge achievements in all fronts, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=48.76s)]
*  and it causes the world to be in awe of our power in the Middle East. First and foremost, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=60.8s)]
*  Iran. We destroyed most, a lot of their aerial abilities, the capability of her missiles, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=71.16s)]
*  and her nuclear program. I'm determined to do anything we need in order to prevent Iran from [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=82.16s)]
*  reaching nuclear weapons. This threat is always top of my priorities, and moreover, today, when [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=90.72s)]
*  you hear the declarations of Iran's leaders, in order to be equipped with nuclear power. Removing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=98.28s)]
*  this threat is the most important task in order to promise our future. We dismantled Hamas battalions, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  we destroyed Sinurad Death and other seniors, and we brought back 194 of our hostages, and we're [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=121.24s)]
*  determined to bring the rest, 101 hostages, to bring back the torture of their families, and we [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=131.88s)]
*  are assured to complete the destruction of Hamas. In Judea and Samaria, we are killing hundreds of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=139.84s)]
*  terrorists and infrastructure of terrorists, and we are acting in all fronts of terror. In Yemen, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  we attacked the Houthis, something that the international community didn't do. In Iraq, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=161.84s)]
*  we prevented many attacks of UAVs. In Syria, we're breaking the trials, the attempts of [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=167.8s)]
*  arming Lebanon from Iran and Hezbollah. Assad needs to know that he's playing with fire, and now in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=183.08s)]
*  Lebanon, Hezbollah chose to attack us on the 8th of October. It's been a year, it's no longer the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=192.6s)]
*  same Hezbollah. We brought it back dozens of years. We destroyed Nasrallah, the rest of the senior [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=199.16s)]
*  personnel, its missiles and rockets, thousands of terrorists, and destroyed the underground [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=211.0s)]
*  infrastructure of terror that's been built there for years. We attacked strategic goals around [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  Lebanon, and we make dozens of buildings falling in Beirut, and the ground is trembling there. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=227.56s)]
*  Citizens of Israel, three months ago it would have been sound science fiction, but it isn't. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=241.8s)]
*  We did it, and I'd like to say to you, in any given moment, that this war, I'm looking at all fronts. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=247.24s)]
*  This is how I acted in the beginning of the war, to focus on Gaza and not opening a new front in [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=261.88s)]
*  Lebanon. This is how I acted a few months ago, where conditions were right to focus on Hezbollah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=269.64s)]
*  This is how I acted when the Iran missile attack happened, when we chose specifically when to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=279.24s)]
*  retaliate and how. And this is how I act today. I look at all fronts, and I see the full picture, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=287.24s)]
*  and I'm determined to give our soldiers, our hero soldiers, all [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=296.44s)]
*  measurements, all measures to keep, save their lives and bring back victory. This is why [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=304.04s)]
*  I will bring an agreement for the cabinet. The duration of it will depend on what happens in Lebanon. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=311.4s)]
*  We keep a whole freedom for military freedom, and if Hezbollah will [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=319.56s)]
*  rearm itself, we will attack. And if he'll fire missiles, if he puts tracks with missiles, we will [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=331.8s)]
*  attack. And I know it's been said that once we agree on ceasefire, we won't be able to do it, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=344.92s)]
*  but I remind you, this is exactly what we've been told when we have a ceasefire with Gaza in order [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  to bring back hostages, our hostages. They said we will not be back fighting, and we did, big time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=357.0s)]
*  They tell me Hezbollah will keep quiet for a year or two, and then they will attack. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=367.24s)]
*  But Hezbollah will finish the ceasefire in order to shoot at us in the future, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=374.92s)]
*  and we will react for any such thing. I know that many do not believe we will do it, but many [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=385.08000000000004s)]
*  didn't believe we will go on the ground in Gaza and Shefa and Khan Yunus, and we did. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=397.72s)]
*  And in front of all the international pressure to enter Rafa in Philadelphia Axis, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=404.44000000000005s)]
*  not only we entered, we attacked, and many didn't believe we attacked in Lebanon, and we [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=411.64000000000004s)]
*  attacked there as well. In huge power and sophistication that the war that surprised the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=419.08s)]
*  world, and after all of that, maybe it's better to believe in our way, in our determination, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=428.44s)]
*  and our commitment to victory. So why doing ceasefire now? There are three main reasons. First, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=434.52s)]
*  we are just focusing on the Iranian threat, and I will not expand on that. Two, refreshing [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=443.47999999999996s)]
*  the military forces and our equipment. And I'm telling you, as it's not a secret, there's been [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=455.23999999999995s)]
*  delays in bringing more weapons and arms, and this delay will finish soon. We will have [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=461.56s)]
*  advanced weaponry that will give us more power to finish our goals. And the third reason for [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=473.24s)]
*  ceasefire, detaching the front of the war from Hamas. From the second war that Hamas pressured [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=482.92s)]
*  Hezbollah to act with him. And now Hezbollah is no longer, and it will help us with the task of [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=494.36s)]
*  bringing our hostages back. We were attacked in seven fronts, and we retaliated. We are changing [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=509.40000000000003s)]
*  the face of the Middle East. All of this we are doing [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=519.88s)]
*  due to our heroic soldiers and your stand [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=526.3599999999999s)]
*  and managing this war. Mindfully, I said many times, a good agreement is such that you can [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=532.3599999999999s)]
*  make it a reality. And with God's help, we will make the north [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=541.32s)]
*  flourish again until the victory. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=556.7600000000001s)]
*  You have been listening to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking on the back of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=560.4399999999999s)]
*  an Israeli security cabinet meeting trying to approve the ceasefire deal between Israel and [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=572.8399999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah. The Israeli security cabinet has voted in favor of a ceasefire deal to end [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=580.28s)]
*  the fighting with Hezbollah. The Prime Minister Netanyahu said for three reasons they are signing [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=589.32s)]
*  on this deal right now. One, he said it was focusing on the Iranian threat and he said he [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=597.88s)]
*  wouldn't expand on that. Two, he said it was an opportunity to refresh military forces and [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=602.36s)]
*  equipment. He talked about delays in having more weapons and arms. And then detaching the front of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=607.72s)]
*  the war from Hamas, of course. But the start of his message was to the Israeli, 60,000 or so [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=615.88s)]
*  Israeli residents who have been pushed away from their homes because of the fighting with Hezbollah. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=625.0s)]
*  And he said we will return all citizens home talking about how proud he is of them. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kP2snT8f6s&t=630.2s)]
