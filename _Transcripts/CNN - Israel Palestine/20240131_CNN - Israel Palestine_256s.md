**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU)
*  In Israel, dozens of hostage families say they are living through [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=0.0s)]
*  unbearable agony, still waiting for news of their loved ones held [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=5.0s)]
*  inside Gaza. Many have grown frustrated with the Israeli government [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=9.0s)]
*  saying it isn't doing enough to free their loved ones. CNN chief [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=13.0s)]
*  international correspondent Clarissa Ward spoke to some exhausted [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=17.0s)]
*  mothers who say they'll not stop fighting until their children are [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=20.0s)]
*  home. In Israel's parliament last week, anger boiling over. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=24.0s)]
*  You will not sit here while they die there, this man shouts. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=29.0s)]
*  Family members of the hostages in Gaza storming into a session at [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=34.0s)]
*  the Knesset saying enough is enough. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=39.0s)]
*  Merav Gonen was never political. Now she's a regular here, pushing [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=43.0s)]
*  lawmakers to do whatever it takes to bring her 21-year-old daughter [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=49.0s)]
*  Romy and the other 131 hostages home. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=53.0s)]
*  We saw these incidents recently here at the Knesset where family [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=58.0s)]
*  members were shouting at politicians. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=63.0s)]
*  This is the frustration. People when they're in fear and frustration, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=67.0s)]
*  it's very difficult to be restrained. Some of us may cry more, maybe [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=72.0s)]
*  close inside, and some of us just need to shout it out. And you know, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=79.0s)]
*  shouting is something this Knesset should be able to contain also [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=85.0s)]
*  because it's too long. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=91.0s)]
*  Shelley Shem Tov is fighting too, delivering a forceful rebuke to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=94.0s)]
*  Israel's war cabinet at a press conference last month. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=99.0s)]
*  Look us in the eyes. It's our children, our families, she says. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=103.0s)]
*  Where are you? Where are you? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=110.0s)]
*  Shelley's 21-year-old son Omer was working as a waiter, saving money [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=114.0s)]
*  to travel the world when he was abducted at the Supernova Music [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=120.0s)]
*  Festival. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=124.0s)]
*  He's a sunshine. He's a boy that everybody wants to be near him. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=126.0s)]
*  Everybody loves him. He loves to love. He loves music. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=132.0s)]
*  On Saturday night, she attended a rally for the hostages, as she does [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=140.0s)]
*  every week, exhausted and frustrated, but undeterred in her quest to bring [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=145.0s)]
*  Omer home. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=151.0s)]
*  I don't know if you are a mother. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=153.0s)]
*  I am. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=155.0s)]
*  So try to imagine. Try to imagine that your son went to a festival. He only [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=157.0s)]
*  went to a festival. You can call your son now to ask him how he's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=167.0s)]
*  doing. You know where your son is sleeping tonight. I don't know. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=177.0s)]
*  It must be agony. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=189.0s)]
*  We are tired. But we are doing everything. It's our mission of our life [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=193.0s)]
*  to bring my son back home. Everybody must say stop. Stop. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=204.0s)]
*  And do you feel that enough is being done? Do you feel satisfied with the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=215.0s)]
*  response? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=222.0s)]
*  Listen, my son is not at home. Every day I'm getting into his room and he's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=224.0s)]
*  still not there sleeping in his bed. So if it's enough, no, it's not enough. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=230.0s)]
*  It's not enough. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=239.0s)]
*  115 days into this nightmare, patience and time are running out. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=245.0s)]
*  Clarissa Ward, CNN, Jerusalem. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2fBUVFnUU&t=252.0s)]
