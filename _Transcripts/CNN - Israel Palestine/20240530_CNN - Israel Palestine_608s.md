# The situation is absolutely ‘apocalyptic,’ says surgeon on his recent trip to Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w)
*  British surgeon Dr Nick Maynard is just back from Gaza where he saw the collapsing healthcare system with his own eyes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=0.0s)]
*  He left Rafa just before Israel's offensive began and he's joining me here now in the studio. Dr Maynard. Welcome to the program [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=6.32s)]
*  Thank you very much for asking me. Um [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=13.44s)]
*  You left and I'm just going to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=15.84s)]
*  Read what you said because you left just as the Israeli incursion began [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=18.32s)]
*  You told Reuters that you heard bombs and gunfire all over driving through Rafa [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=22.36s)]
*  The tension was palpable with people evacuating as rapidly as they could you saw some of that attempt to evacuate [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  In Jeremy's package there. What did you see and what is the status of people who just want to get out of the way? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=33.72s)]
*  So they issued the initial evacuation orders about two hours before we left for the crossing and and we saw [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=40.2s)]
*  hundreds of people rushing out of there I [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=47.8s)]
*  Was gonna say houses. They're not house [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=51.28s)]
*  Of course, these people have been displaced many times that they were leaving their very temporary shelters their [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=53.16s)]
*  makeshift tents their [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=59.48s)]
*  tarpaulin [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=61.28s)]
*  shelters [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Gathering their belongings together going in cars some of them walking some of them going on a cart with donkers and rushing out and it was [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=63.28s)]
*  very distressing to see them leaving so urgently because that this for some of them [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=71.48s)]
*  This is the fifth sixth seventh time they've done that in the last six months where you were leaving as well [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=76.2s)]
*  What was it like for you? Is it I mean did you get you obviously out safely? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  But was it dangerous as you were trying to get out? So we we didn't think we were gonna get out [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=85.68s)]
*  We were initially turned away. So we went back to the temperate. Well, we were advised to leave [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=90.12s)]
*  so there was ongoing discussions between the the medical aid for Palestinian ground staff and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=95.4s)]
*  Kogat the liaison part of the IDF and so they initially decided for security reasons [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  We should go back to the house [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=106.26s)]
*  But then we left again late morning got to the crossing as the bombings were intensifying [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=108.32s)]
*  So we were surrounded by bombs going off really virtually non-stop and there was very [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=114.44s)]
*  difficult decisions to be made about whether we should carry on with our [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=121.6s)]
*  Planned departure or whether we should turn around because it was getting too dangerous, but we did stay and we managed to get out [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=126.32s)]
*  You warned in March actually before the raffa operation started certainly before you know that if a ground invasion happened a ground [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=133.94s)]
*  Incursion of some sort it would be apocalyptic and Gaza's Health Ministry said in a statement now [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=141.54s)]
*  particularly after the Sunday [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=148.54s)]
*  Attack there is no hospital in raffa with enough capacity to take this number of killed and injured [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  Causing confusion amongst ambulance teams on where to transfer them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=157.06s)]
*  Give us a layout of what hospitals remain what don't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=161.52s)]
*  Anywhere nearby these places that are you know under IDF attack so so raffa is a small town [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=166.56s)]
*  It has a population of one to two hundred thousand people normally as it has two hospitals one government hospital and a hospital [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=173.16s)]
*  Which normally has a capacity of about 60 beds and a small hospital called the Q80 hospital [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  Which has been in the news a lot in the last few days which has the capacity [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  Which has the capacity normally of 15 1 5 beds so they have very limited beds there [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=190.0s)]
*  They've got a bigger hospital between raffa and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=196.0s)]
*  Unis called the European Gaza hospital which I've worked in a lot over the years [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=199.68s)]
*  Which is surrounded by the Israeli ground forces as very difficult for patients to get to that so effectively there are no [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=203.72s)]
*  Hospitals for these patients to go to there are some field hospitals been set up [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=212.8s)]
*  But the number of acute beds available to take these patients is very very few and have you been in touch with any [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=216.76s)]
*  Colleagues in the medical profession or anybody in raffa since you've left particularly in the last few days [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=224.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I spoke yesterday to a dear friend of mine [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=230.32s)]
*  Who's a operating theater nurse who almost to the day a year ago? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=233.72s)]
*  I was operating within the theaters in European Gaza hospital. She stayed in raffa [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=238.4s)]
*  She and her husband are living there. They don't want to leave and she said to me yesterday [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=243.28s)]
*  She would rather die and she expects to die in her home, and she's not going to leave [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=247.08s)]
*  I haven't been able to get hold of her today, and she hasn't answered any message [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=252.08s)]
*  So I don't know what's happened to her half her family have been killed in the last few months [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=256.0s)]
*  I've got a close friend. Who's a doctor who's out there? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=261.2s)]
*  I've been speaking to them regularly, but the the the words we used a few weeks ago of this being apocalyptic [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=263.88s)]
*  It absolutely is there are many people being killed there [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=270.68s)]
*  Those that have been evacuated have been forced to go to al-mawasi, which is an area [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=274.64s)]
*  I know well there are already hundreds of thousands of people there [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=279.6s)]
*  They've had to accommodate nearly a million extra people and there is nothing there al-mawasi is a thin stretch of sand [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=284.06s)]
*  And wasteland divided by a road with no facilities at all so the idea they can accommodate [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=293.4s)]
*  In any sort of safe way another million people is fanciful [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=300.12s)]
*  You're a doctor you're a surgeon and you've worked in Gaza for some ten years [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=305.6s)]
*  You've been going back and forth through other wars presumably [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=309.96000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you this because you saw in Jeremy Diamond's report there. They saw the weapons [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=313.76s)]
*  They were described as slightly less [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  Huge and powerful perhaps to try to mitigate civilian damage. These are American-made weapons [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=322.28s)]
*  But from a doctor's point of view particularly as he said Jeremy in a in a densely populated zone [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=330.96s)]
*  Light weapon a light bomb or heavy bomb is going to create a huge amount of civilian destruction [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=337.52s)]
*  What what what do you what can you say about the weapons that are used Gaza's got a population of? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=342.67999999999995s)]
*  2.2 million it is the most densely populated place in the world. I was there last May [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=348.92s)]
*  Operating on the cancer surgeon was operating on cancer patients part of the map program [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=355.84s)]
*  And it was the last big bombardment before October the 7th beginning of May and I was stuck there [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=360.56s)]
*  They closed the borders and we had to be evacuated eventually, but I witnessed for four days this non-stop bombardment and [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=367.65999999999997s)]
*  it was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=375.44s)]
*  An incredible demonstration of how precise the bombing can be when the Israeli Defense Force want to do that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  They were targeting specific rooms in buildings specific floors and there was collateral damage [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=385.32s)]
*  But minimal collateral damage at that time. So I've witnessed at first hand how precise their targeting can be [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=391.98s)]
*  Move forward to post October the 7th [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=399.32s)]
*  I was there over Christmas and New Year and I witnessed I watched the indiscriminate bombing of large [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=401.96s)]
*  Populations in the surrounding camps in Dar al-Bala where I was staying for two weeks [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=410.2s)]
*  So I've witnessed two extremes [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=415.06s)]
*  I've seen how precision how precise their targeting can be and I've seen how indiscriminate can be and there's no doubt in my mind [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=417.71999999999997s)]
*  That what we've seen since October the 7th is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=425.12s)]
*  indiscriminate killing of large [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=429.2s)]
*  population civilian of a large population so you know they deny that every time and they say over and over again that we are doing our [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=431.52s)]
*  best to minimize civilian and they say [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=438.28s)]
*  What do you expect if? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  The Hamas terrorist organization as they say they're fighting is using human shields is using [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=443.36s)]
*  Garzons to to shield themselves from any kind of retaliation or action. What do you say about that? Well, I've I've not witnessed that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=449.56s)]
*  I [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=458.2s)]
*  Think if it's difficult for me to understand how anyone can claim that killing 35 civilians [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=459.76000000000005s)]
*  is a proportionate response to [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  To events earlier, but I mean 35,000 35,000 people I've not witnessed [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=469.24s)]
*  What they're describing and perhaps more importantly than that my friends and colleagues who I have [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=475.72s)]
*  Spoken to daily since October sense have lived out there with them for several weeks since then do not [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=482.24s)]
*  Provide any evidence to support that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=488.2s)]
*  They would say that they're there they live in these whatever the underground or in buildings or whatever [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=491.56s)]
*  That's what they would say [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=497.12s)]
*  But it's interesting what you said about witnessing very targeted and witnessing something that's much less targeted [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=498.0s)]
*  I want to ask you specific a specifically in your you know, your your domain about the health [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=504.48s)]
*  System. I mean I can just read you and you'll tell me much more. I mean Kamal at one hospital, you know [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=510.56s)]
*  Dozens of medical staff has taken to an undisclosed locate location that was in December last year [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=517.12s)]
*  The IDF says takes all feasible precautions to mitigate harm, etc [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=522.48s)]
*  NASA Hospital February of this year 70 healthcare workers in the medical complex arrested by Israeli forces 80 patients transferred out [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=526.48s)]
*  They said they had apprehended hundreds of Hamas militants al-shifa hospital. Well, we know what's happened. There's completely a ruin [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=534.96s)]
*  They said they were going after Hamas targets underneath and tunnels [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=542.0s)]
*  Did you ever come across anything suspicious? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=545.76s)]
*  Did you ever ask any of your actually the directors of the hospitals the people who would be there when you're not there whether there was any [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  threat from you know, a militant group using their premises I [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=555.6s)]
*  Did and I can only really for vouch for what I have witnessed and and and what close friends and colleagues have said [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=560.2s)]
*  I've been in these hospitals on many occasions [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=566.12s)]
*  Before October 7th, but also since then I have never witnessed [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=569.52s)]
*  I've never seen any evidence of Hamas militants in these hospitals and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=573.16s)]
*  My close friends and colleagues some of whom I've known for nearly 15 years [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=576.96s)]
*  I've asked them repeatedly and they've never witnessed any of this now clearly I cannot [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=580.88s)]
*  Provide any evidence for what goes on in any any tunnels underneath [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=585.72s)]
*  I've never seen them, but if you take she for hospital as an example, which I know very well [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=589.28s)]
*  I I've been to every square inch of that hospital. I have never seen any [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=593.96s)]
*  Restricted acts of violence [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=599.4s)]
*  Restricted access at all to any parts of the hospital. So I've seen no evidence of what they describe [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h8FeGqPO7w&t=601.4s)]
