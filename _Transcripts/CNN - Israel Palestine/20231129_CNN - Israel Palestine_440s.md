# Israeli troops kill 8-year-old boy during raid of West Bank refugee camp
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w)
*  Israeli forces with bulldozers and jeeps enter the camp under the cover of darkness. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=0.0s)]
*  This has become a routine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  And this is the usual aftermath. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=16.6s)]
*  Wreckage and rubble, asphalt roads plowed down to the dirt. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=19.2s)]
*  Once the damage is repaired, there's another raid and it's the same thing all over again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=25.12s)]
*  For almost two years, a low-intensity war has been raging in the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=31.8s)]
*  Residents here in Jenin's refugee camp say that there have been more than 30 Israeli [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=38.28s)]
*  military incursions since August of this year. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=43.44s)]
*  The camp is home to militants who Israel has accused of involvement in attacks on Israelis. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  But here, those whom Israel calls terrorists are seen as fighters against a decades-long [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=55.08s)]
*  military occupation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=61.16s)]
*  Wadi Amm Kaskas is not a fighter. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=63.76s)]
*  He works for the local government. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=66.08s)]
*  But last week, Israeli soldiers took over his home during yet another raid. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=69.28s)]
*  As he shows me around, the remains of what was a family's life crunch under our shoes. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=75.44s)]
*  Brutal is how Wadiya sums up the soldier's behavior. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=83.0s)]
*  Scars of battles past pockmark the camp's walls, debris on almost every corner. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  Um Sami shows me spent cartridges on the floor of her house, saying Israeli troops used this [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=95.96s)]
*  room to fire down into the street. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=102.56s)]
*  They took my husband, bound his hands and pushed him outside in the cold, she says. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=107.72s)]
*  They kept him there from six in the evening until five in the morning. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=112.56s)]
*  Eventually, the soldiers let him go, but took away her recently married son after ransacking [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  his bedroom searching for weapons. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=123.72s)]
*  Eighteen-year-old Mahmoud Abou El-Hajji was shot last Thursday evening, shot through his [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=127.12s)]
*  bedroom window. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=132.16s)]
*  His mother Khitam, holding a blood-stained towel, recounts how Israeli soldiers wouldn't [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=134.04s)]
*  allow medics to take him to hospital. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=139.64s)]
*  I was sure we were going to the hospital, she says. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  We went downstairs. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=147.32s)]
*  A second officer was there and made the medics put the stretcher down. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=148.32s)]
*  Mahmoud bled to death in front of his home. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=153.92s)]
*  Tuesday night, Israeli forces raided the camp again, sparking gun battles with militants. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=157.72s)]
*  And in the process, Israeli troops killed at least four people, including this eight-year-old [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=165.48s)]
*  boy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=170.0s)]
*  And then they left. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=171.0s)]
*  And Ben Weederman joins us now. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=175.12s)]
*  And Ben, as we've been reporting, had been reporting at the beginning of this year on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=177.32s)]
*  the show, the violence that we have been seeing in the West Bank predates the October 7th [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=180.32s)]
*  attack. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=185.4s)]
*  We've seen over 260 Palestinians detained in the West Bank since Friday 24th. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=186.4s)]
*  And according to the Palestinian society here, prisoner society, why are more Palestinians [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=191.44s)]
*  being detained? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=197.4s)]
*  Well, basically, I mean, really since the 7th of October, you've seen this great upsurge. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  Now, of course, I think part of it is the Israelis are nervous about the situation in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=207.4s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=212.96s)]
*  Let's keep in mind that actually the situation around Gaza, except for a flare-up back in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  May of this year, has been rarely stable. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=219.76s)]
*  But what we've seen is increasingly the Israeli government has been focusing on the West Bank. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=225.04s)]
*  We have extremist ministers in the Israeli government who are pushing the idea of expanding [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=231.96s)]
*  settlements, empowering the settlers, more handing out weapons to them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=239.52s)]
*  So certainly what we're seeing is that there's more unrest among the Palestinians who aren't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=245.4s)]
*  happy with this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  But more than that, I think the Israelis see the situation in the West Bank and are trying [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=252.28s)]
*  to sort of keep the natives under control, so to speak. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=257.72s)]
*  But increasingly as they watch what's going on in Gaza, and they have been experiencing [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=263.08s)]
*  in recent years this upsurge in settlement activity and settler violence, keeping in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  mind how many have been killed since the beginning of the war in Gaza, almost 250. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=275.0s)]
*  It's a powder keg. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  And even American officials have warned the Israelis that they have to bring the settlers [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=285.0s)]
*  under control, and perhaps the conditions for money given to Israel have to be increased [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=289.88s)]
*  because of the trouble that can be posed by the current Israeli policy in the West Bank. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=299.2s)]
*  You say it's a powder keg. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=305.76s)]
*  You know the region, you know the West Bank better than most journalists, I think it's [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=307.2s)]
*  fair to say. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=311.52s)]
*  So I'm keen to get your sense, Ben, of what the mood is like. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=312.52s)]
*  We've seen in the past several days Palestinians being released, a jubilant celebration. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=317.15999999999997s)]
*  Some can't even celebrate outside, of course. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=322.92s)]
*  That's what we've been hearing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=326.36s)]
*  But if this truce is not extended and we go back to Israel trying to break the back of [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=328.04s)]
*  Hamas, we've heard from the IDF in the last few moments saying they're preparing ourselves [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  for continuing of this fighting. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=337.20000000000005s)]
*  If that continues, what could change in the West Bank? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=339.8s)]
*  Well, I think if the fighting resumes in Gaza and we see the kind of bloodshed, the sort [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=344.8s)]
*  of mass killing of civilians in Gaza, the situation could become even more unstable. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=352.72s)]
*  Keep in mind that it's not the Palestinian Authority backed by the United States and [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=359.24s)]
*  the European Union and led by Mahmoud Abbas that's winning the freedom of these Palestinian [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=363.92s)]
*  prisoners and detainees. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  It's Hamas. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=373.52s)]
*  And by and large the Palestinian Authority is looked as upon by most Palestinians in [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=374.88s)]
*  the West Bank as corrupt and incapable and powerless when it comes to dealing with the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=381.56s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=388.72s)]
*  That's why, for instance, Jenin, which technically is under Palestinian Authority control, the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=389.04s)]
*  Israelis every time they go into that city, they drive right in. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=394.72s)]
*  The Palestinian police, who I saw yesterday when I went to Jenin, disappear. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=398.52s)]
*  They put up no resistance. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=404.4s)]
*  So the political structure that was established by the Oslo Accords sponsored by the United [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=406.84s)]
*  States establishing the Palestinian Authority, that's eroding as the war in Gaza continues, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=412.96s)]
*  if it continues. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=421.08s)]
*  And it probably will continue in the coming days. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=421.96s)]
*  So politically, the head at the top of the Palestinian Authority is not particularly [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  stable. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=432.23999999999995s)]
*  But I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=435.84s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=438.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=440.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=442.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=444.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=446.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=448.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=450.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=452.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=454.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=456.84s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEwZOBeU3w&t=458.84s)]
