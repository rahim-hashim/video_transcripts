# Protests erupt near US embassy in Lebanon amid Gaza hospital blast
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ)
*  A U.S. defense official says that the U.S. had to shoot down two attack drones that were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=0.0s)]
*  targeting U.S. forces in Iraq. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=6.0s)]
*  There were no injuries there. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=8.96s)]
*  And it is not clear who exactly launched the drones. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=10.6s)]
*  But such attacks, they say, are frequently attributed to Iran or Iranian-backed militants [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=13.92s)]
*  in the region. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=19.88s)]
*  The news comes, of course, as American embassies have been facing protests in a number of Middle [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=20.88s)]
*  East countries because of the war in Gaza right now in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=26.42s)]
*  Hundreds of protesters are gathered in the streets as they were overnight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=33.38s)]
*  This is video, I think, of overnight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=38.900000000000006s)]
*  They tried to break through security barriers near the U.S. embassy. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=42.08s)]
*  And these are live. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=46.540000000000006s)]
*  OK, so I can't, it's difficult for me to see where I'm from, my vantage point. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=47.540000000000006s)]
*  But yes, these are live pictures happening right now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=51.02s)]
*  You see lots of smoke. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=54.94s)]
*  You see people in the streets. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=57.56s)]
*  They are clearly, clearly terribly upset about what is happening next door to Lebanon, in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=60.18s)]
*  Gaza in particular. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=67.72s)]
*  You can hear the chants, hundreds of people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=68.9s)]
*  Let's bring in CNN's Ben Wiedemann, who is in south Lebanon, live for us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=73.02s)]
*  Ben, can you just give us a sense of what you've been seeing on the ground and what [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=78.94s)]
*  you've been hearing from your sources about these protests? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=84.34s)]
*  Well, we're hearing some large explosions just to the south of here, near the border [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=93.42s)]
*  with Israel. But these protests are very much reflective of the number of many people in [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=98.54s)]
*  Lebanon, particularly it's been simmering since the 7th of October, but particularly [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=104.22s)]
*  since that strike on the hospital in Gaza yesterday. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  Last night, we saw protests outside the U.S. embassy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=114.86s)]
*  It's north of Beirut. It's actually not in Beirut. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=118.22s)]
*  It's about eight miles north of Beirut. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  And of course, again, we're seeing it today with protesters throwing rocks and shooting [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  fireworks at the Lebanese police, police responding with water cannons and lots and lots of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=127.72s)]
*  tear gas. It's important to keep in mind that behind those barriers, it's about half a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=134.5s)]
*  mile up the hill to the U.S. embassy itself. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=138.94s)]
*  There's another explosion and this embassy is highly fortified. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=142.06s)]
*  The staff aren't allowed to simply walk out the door and enjoy the pleasures of Beirut [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=146.62s)]
*  because of security concerns. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=151.42s)]
*  Now, speaking of the embassy, the State Department has said that families of U.S. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=153.78s)]
*  embassies, staff members and non-emergency personnel are now authorized to leave the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=159.94s)]
*  country should they so desire on a case by case basis. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=165.62s)]
*  The United States has also advised Americans not to travel to Lebanon and we're seeing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=170.02s)]
*  a similar advisory coming out of France as well. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=175.46s)]
*  Now, regarding the situation in south Lebanon, we've had two strikes by Hezbollah on Israeli [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=180.06s)]
*  positions. Hezbollah puts out videos of these strikes and it appears that among other things, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=186.22s)]
*  they have struck a tank. Overnight, we heard a fair amount of explosions. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=193.5s)]
*  There's another one in the distance. I don't know if you can pick that up, but certainly [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=199.02s)]
*  reflective of the ongoing tensions here on the border between Lebanon and Israel. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=202.66s)]
*  Sarah? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=210.06s)]
*  Ben, you have been in this region for a very long time and just to get your sense of things, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=211.38s)]
*  for example, during the second Intifada, what things look like in places like Beirut and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=218.74s)]
*  in places like Jordan in comparison to what we are seeing now because Jordan also has [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=223.38s)]
*  a huge number of Palestinians that live in Jordan and that have reacted in a very big [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=228.66s)]
*  way to what has happened in Gaza. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=235.14s)]
*  All of these protests coming, of course, after a hospital was struck by someone. We do not [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=238.26s)]
*  know who at this point in time. We have not independently confirmed any of it, but Israel [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=245.22s)]
*  blaming Islamic Jihad and of course Hamas blaming Israeli airstrikes. Can you give us [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=250.26s)]
*  some sense of just context of what we are seeing now in neighboring countries to Israel? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=255.98s)]
*  Well, what we are seeing is it is boiling over. The anger, people have been watching [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=262.98s)]
*  very closely, intensely what is going on in Gaza. There's been scattered protests, but [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=269.54s)]
*  certainly yesterday I think that anger boiled over. It boiled over in Amman where protesters [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=275.42s)]
*  went to the Israeli embassy, set fires around it, tried to get in, but were pushed back [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  by Jordanian police. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  In Ramallah, Ramallah is a particularly important city place. It is essentially the capital [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=290.18s)]
*  of the Palestinian Authority. There we saw protesters clashing with Palestinian security [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=295.70000000000005s)]
*  forces. The protesters were condemning what is happening in Gaza, but in addition to that, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=303.3s)]
*  they were calling for the downfall of Mahmoud Abbas, the 87-year-old president of the Palestinian [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=308.94s)]
*  Authority who many Palestinians see as ineffectual. He's been passive during this current war. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=317.34s)]
*  He doesn't seem to have any sway with the Israelis who don't respect the system of zones [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  areas that exist in the West Bank where in theory the Palestinian Authority is supposed [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  to be in control, but the Israeli security forces go in as they please without any coordination [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=339.1s)]
*  with the Palestinians. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  In short, it's a very shaky regime in the West Bank, and much of the anger in addition [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=347.70000000000005s)]
*  to being directed at Israel is directed at what is seen as a corrupt and ineffectual [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=353.14000000000004s)]
*  Palestinian Authority. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=358.90000000000003s)]
*  Sarah? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=360.94s)]
*  Really good reporting, really good contacts. Thank you so much, Ben Wiedemann, for being [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=362.3s)]
*  there on the ground. Are you still hearing some munitions, it sounds like, behind you? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=369.82s)]
*  Scattered, yes, but at this very moment, no. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=377.82s)]
*  Okay. All right. Keeping you and your crew as safe as possible in these difficult conditions, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=382.82s)]
*  thank you, Ben. Kate, I'm going to go ahead and send it back to you. I just want to mention [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=390.74s)]
*  we are watching these live pictures of an extraordinary number of people who have come [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=394.38s)]
*  out to the streets. This is in Beirut. We are watching this live. People reacting, so [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=398.12s)]
*  upset to see what has happened, particularly in the hospital strike that has, according [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=405.12s)]
*  to Hamas, killed hundreds of people, including obviously patients, men, women and children. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKGBsmYXtFQ&t=411.3s)]
