# Military analyst: Hamas is losing the second phase of their plan already
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o)
*  Joining me now is CNN military analyst General Wesley Clark. So, General, first I'm going to want to talk to you about what's going on at the border. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=0.0s)]
*  But before that, can you just talk about the significance of these two very important U.S. naval carriers going into the region and what it is meant to do? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=9.0s)]
*  Sure. Those two aircraft carriers and the flotillas that go with them. So you've got about 20 ships there. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=21.0s)]
*  You've got tremendous capacity for not only the aircraft on each aircraft carrier, but the escorts and what they can do in the way of Tomahawk missiles and other things. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=27.0s)]
*  And so they're there as a warning. They're there as a deterrent to Iran. It's keep your hands off. Stay out of it or else. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=36.0s)]
*  Because the general thinking is that Hezbollah is not going to go in, of course, without Iran saying go ahead. This ties Iran directly into the assault. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=47.0s)]
*  So on the other hand, you can be sure that Iran is watching this. They're calculating. They're wondering whether the Israelis are going to get so bogged down in Gaza, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=57.0s)]
*  be so tarnished in world opinion that they could justify releasing Hezbollah and go for the finish of Israel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=67.0s)]
*  There is going to be that kind of thinking going on in Tehran. Those two aircraft carriers are really important to stop that kind of thought. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=77.0s)]
*  And I just want to underscore you say it is a deterrent. We have definitely heard some this morning in interviews not ruling out the notion of U.S. troops being involved. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=86.0s)]
*  I think it's important to put that into context. And it certainly does not seem as though the U.S. is going to get involved in a very active way with U.S. troops in this conflict. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=98.0s)]
*  The discussion is about how to get American hostages out and American civilians out, but mostly American hostages at this point. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=112.0s)]
*  That's right. And I'm sure that we've got a joint planning going on right now with the Israelis. If we could locate the hostages, if it's possible to put in an extraction mission. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=120.0s)]
*  Sure, we would work with the Israelis to do that. But there's also the possibility of those U.S. forces in the north actually having to engage should Hezbollah decide to launch its 150,000 rockets against Israel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=130.0s)]
*  And Iran should be under no illusion. Those ships are not just there for show. Those ships are ready to go. And on the president's order, they could go. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=147.0s)]
*  So as President Biden said, we're 100 percent committed to Israel. We're not going to allow the destruction of Israel. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=158.0s)]
*  I really want to get your your perspective on what is happening inside Gaza and the idea that according to the White House Hamas, they're the ones who stopped Americans from getting into Egypt via the Rafa border crossing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=165.0s)]
*  We're talking about Palestinians. We're talking about. Excuse me. We're talking in this case about Americans who are inside Gaza. These are civilians. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=181.0s)]
*  What does it tell you, first of all, that that crossing was closed? And what is your sense of why this really happened? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=193.0s)]
*  And you see we're showing our viewers a map of the area we're talking about now. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=201.0s)]
*  Well, Dan, I think, you know, Hamas always look at this is at least a two phased operation. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=205.0s)]
*  First is provoke the Israelis do as much damage you can show how powerful you are, then fall back into Gaza and use a civilian population as a shield and then attack Israel on the stage of world opinion and cause Israel to look like an evil force that's anti humanitarian. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=210.0s)]
*  And what's happening right now is that Hamas is losing the second phase already before the fighting's even started because the people there are getting out of the way. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=229.0s)]
*  Hamas may be trying to keep them in position, but Hamas is failing to do that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=240.0s)]
*  They are evacuating the northern area despite Hamas roadblocks. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=245.0s)]
*  That big explosion we saw yesterday. I'd be very surprised if that was an Israeli explosion on a main evacuation route. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=249.0s)]
*  That looks like something engineered by Hamas to intimidate its own people. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=257.0s)]
*  Their view is that those people are they're just human shields. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=261.0s)]
*  They're collateral. They don't care about those people. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=266.0s)]
*  What they're interested in is the destruction of Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=269.0s)]
*  And so the poor people in in in Gaza, as President Biden said, they're not all Hamas. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=271.0s)]
*  There's a lot of really innocent people in there. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=278.0s)]
*  They they need to be protected, too. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=280.0s)]
*  And the United States and Israel are doing the best they can to do that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=283.0s)]
*  At the same time, Hamas needs to be eliminated. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=287.0s)]
*  And that's what the Israeli objective is going to be eventually. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=290.0s)]
*  But in this phase, it's already underway. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=293.0s)]
*  Hamas is losing control of the population. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=296.0s)]
*  And that's a huge loss for Hamas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=299.0s)]
*  I just underscore we're out of time, but just underscore what you just said. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=302.0s)]
*  That Hamas, which is supposed to be the leadership of Gaza, is trying to prevent innocent civilians from getting out of harm's way, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=306.0s)]
*  getting out of a war zone because they think it helps them in the propaganda war. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=314.0s)]
*  It's really important to talk about the difference there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=318.0s)]
*  General Wesley Clark, thank you so much. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FHmHpe2P6o&t=322.0s)]
