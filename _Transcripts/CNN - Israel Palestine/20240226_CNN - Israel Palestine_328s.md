# Fareed's Take: The scope of the Israel-Hamas war is widening
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ)
*  Here's my take. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Looking at the crises proliferating around the world, it's clear that we are in an age [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=3.68s)]
*  of geopolitical tension that resembles the Cold War, a time of constant continual threats [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=7.9s)]
*  to international order. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=14.72s)]
*  But this time, the West is treating each of these threats as one-offs to be dealt with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  separately in the hope that soon normalcy will return. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=22.04s)]
*  But conflict is the new normal. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=26.52s)]
*  Look around. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=29.68s)]
*  The war is going badly for Ukraine, which is critically outgunned and outmanned by its [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=31.16s)]
*  much larger adversary. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=36.44s)]
*  Its key advantage, access to Western arms and money, is in peril. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=38.8s)]
*  The U.S. Congress seems unwilling to pass legislation to send it more arms and money. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=43.86s)]
*  The European Union is stepping in and filling parts of the gap, but Europe does not have [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=48.14s)]
*  the military-industrial complex to send Ukraine the level of armaments it needs to fight Russia. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=52.36s)]
*  Ukraine's army has held out heroically against Russia's onslaught. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=59.48s)]
*  But as a senior European diplomat said to me recently, Ukrainians are brave and bold, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=63.0s)]
*  but they are not supermen. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=68.2s)]
*  They will not be able to hold on if they don't have weapons and supplies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=69.88s)]
*  Putin is making sure that he can keep the war going, getting arms from North Korea and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=74.6s)]
*  recruiting men from as far as Cuba. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=79.56s)]
*  He continues to benefit from the fact that many of the world's major economies, from [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=82.46s)]
*  China and India to Turkey and the Gulf states, are trading freely with Russia. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=86.56s)]
*  If Russia's aggression works, it tears up a norm that has largely stood for 80 years [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=91.92s)]
*  â€” no change of borders by force. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=96.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, in the Middle East, many believed when the Gaza war began that it would be short [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  and that Prime Minister Netanyahu's government would fall. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  Neither is likely. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=107.72s)]
*  The Israel Defense Forces, humiliated by the surprise attack of October 7, are determined [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  to completely eradicate Hamas from Gaza. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=114.8s)]
*  That means months more of bombing, fighting and bulldozing. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=118.44s)]
*  The tensions and internal debates that Israel's actions will produce in other countries will [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=122.42s)]
*  only rise. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu is going nowhere. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=129.48s)]
*  Most Israelis may dislike him, but they approve of his war policies. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=131.6s)]
*  This week, an appointed rebuke to international calls to pursue a two-state solution, including [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  from the U.S. and Britain. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=142.24s)]
*  Israel's Knesset approved a resolution declaring that it was opposed to any unilateral recognition [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=144.52s)]
*  of a Palestinian state, with 99 out of 120 votes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=150.04s)]
*  Bibi's coalition, remember, has only 64 members, so many opposition parliamentarians joined [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=155.0s)]
*  in. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=160.32s)]
*  One less noticed theater has been in the north. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=161.64s)]
*  Israel has been striking and killing Hezbollah militants, to the point that by one account, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=164.28s)]
*  they have killed over 200 of them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=168.68s)]
*  This campaign will continue and might even accelerate. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  The IDF's goal is to weaken Hezbollah to the point that the roughly 80,000 Israelis who [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  fled their homes in northern Israel can return. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=179.36s)]
*  But at some point, Hezbollah might respond forcefully, which could trigger an Israeli [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=183.32000000000002s)]
*  incursion into Lebanon, truly widening the war. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=188.02s)]
*  And then we have the Houthis, who have managed to assert themselves through a series of pinprick [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=193.72000000000003s)]
*  strikes that, according to one consulting firm, have reduced the number of container [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=198.36s)]
*  vessels through the Suez Canal by about 72 percent since they began in December. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=202.84s)]
*  American efforts to organize an effective coalition to keep trade flowing through the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=209.28s)]
*  Red Sea have failed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  Its efforts to respond to Houthi attacks have not stopped the Houthis. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=215.88000000000002s)]
*  This failure is a blow to the credibility of the United States, guaranteeing the freedom [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=220.86s)]
*  of the seas, a key component of the open global economy that's been built over two [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=225.3s)]
*  centuries, first with the British Navy and then the American. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=230.44s)]
*  And more threats to maritime underpinnings of that order are on the horizon. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=233.9s)]
*  Russia and China have both been building up the capacity to cut undersea cables, which [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=238.9s)]
*  are now an integral part of the cloud on which data is stored across the globe. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=245.02s)]
*  If the U.S. can't deter a sub-state actor like the Houthis from its disruptive behavior [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=250.3s)]
*  in the Red Sea, what chance does it have against powers like China and Russia? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=255.34s)]
*  There are ways to address all these problems, but it requires a paradigm shift in the Western [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=261.14s)]
*  world. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=265.9s)]
*  We are now in a high security age. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=267.0s)]
*  That means governments have to spend significantly more in defense and spend more efficiently. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=270.06s)]
*  The U.S. took on the role as guarantor of the freedom of the seas in 1945 and has been [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=275.46s)]
*  master of the seas ever since. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=280.58s)]
*  In the 1980s, it had almost 600 ships, but today it has fewer than 300. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=282.5s)]
*  Europe has lost its military-industrial complex, which allowed it to produce munitions on a [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  near-constant basis. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=294.65999999999997s)]
*  In these new dangerous times, congressional Republicans have decided to return to isolationism, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=297.34s)]
*  hoping that they can bury their heads in the sand and the problems will somehow go [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=303.02s)]
*  away. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=306.7s)]
*  It should be noted that, contrary to popular belief, ostriches do not bury their heads [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=308.29999999999995s)]
*  in the sand to escape threats. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=312.94s)]
*  In fact, it would lead to their asphyxiation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=314.78s)]
*  Maybe the birds understand something congressional Republicans don't. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5-gNOUhCQ&t=318.74s)]
