# Jon Stewart calls out US on Gaza stance. Hear his take
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg)
*  Let's talk a little bit more about the community in Michigan that has, and you talked a little [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=0.0s)]
*  bit about this yesterday, about just the sheer emotion that is driving this. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=7.96s)]
*  And just to kind of give people a sense, in Michigan, David referenced the 10,000 votes [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=14.3s)]
*  that separated Hillary Clinton from Donald Trump when Donald Trump won Michigan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=18.68s)]
*  It was 150,000 votes that separated Trump and Biden in 2020 when Biden won. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=23.64s)]
*  There are about 140,000 people who voted in that election who say that they are Muslims. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=32.28s)]
*  Now that's obviously not all Arab Americans are Muslim. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=37.4s)]
*  Not all Muslims are Arab American. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=40.08s)]
*  But this is a really significant community. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  And Talib has been encouraging them to vote as a bloc. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=44.6s)]
*  How do you see that playing out? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=47.36s)]
*  Well, I think that's kind of the point of primaries, right? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=49.0s)]
*  I would just take your moment, as she says, to have a bullhorn and say this is the issue [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=52.12s)]
*  that matters to me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  I'd also like to broaden this out because this is not necessarily an issue, what's going [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  on in Gaza, that is affecting Arab Americans only. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=61.9s)]
*  Generationally, young people in the Democratic Party view this differently. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=65.12s)]
*  Michigan has a large student population. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=70.38s)]
*  Michigan has, as you said, a large Arab American and even black Muslim population. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=72.72s)]
*  These are all people who find affinity with what they see as oppression in the region. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=77.88s)]
*  And one of the reasons why I think this is an interesting test is having a test of the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=82.83999999999999s)]
*  coalition, meaning your white, blue collar labor guys, your various affinity groups, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  your students. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=94.52s)]
*  This is a different picture than South Carolina, don't you think? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=95.56s)]
*  Where it was really more like, hey, remember those folks who helped us last time? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=98.0s)]
*  Are they coming back? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=101.32s)]
*  This is like, oh, well, what is the picture of the group of voters who bank up Biden? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=102.64s)]
*  And is this going to happen? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=108.6s)]
*  I mean, is that, am I reading too much into Michigan? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=110.16s)]
*  No, I think you get a little representative in Michigan of each slice of his coalition. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=112.68s)]
*  And they're saying, look, you walk the picket lines for labor. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=117.64s)]
*  Like, you know, the mayor of Dearborn was upset when they sent campaign people instead [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=120.84s)]
*  of policy people to talk about the Middle East. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=124.98s)]
*  They're saying take us seriously. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=127.52s)]
*  And I think that's maybe how we can think of it instead of just sort of like, which [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=129.6s)]
*  identity group is complaining today? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=132.68s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=135.76s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=136.76s)]
*  Jon Stewart actually opened the Daily Show with a monologue about Gaza last night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=137.76s)]
*  I want to watch a little bit of that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=141.72s)]
*  Hey, Israel. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=144.72s)]
*  Take a turn tonight. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=146.72s)]
*  Could you please be more careful with your bombing? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=150.72s)]
*  It's good advice. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=152.72s)]
*  But really, couldn't the United States have told Israel that when we gave them all the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=153.72s)]
*  bombs, there are bombs. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=158.84s)]
*  This is like your Coke dealer coming in with an eight ball and going, don't stay up all [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=161.84s)]
*  night. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=166.84s)]
*  Jonah Goldberg, we've talked a lot about where Democrats are on this and Ashley, you know, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=167.84s)]
*  way in too. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=172.84s)]
*  But there's a reason why the president has been where he is this entire time on this [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=173.84s)]
*  issue, which is that still, despite the pressure from progressives, a lot of the country is [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=176.84s)]
*  with them on Israel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=180.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's sort of my problem with the way the media generally talks about the Michigan [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=181.84s)]
*  issue and all that is, you know, there's nothing wrong with the squeaky wheel getting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=185.96s)]
*  attention. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=190.96s)]
*  That's how politics, that's how democracy works. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=191.96s)]
*  People who organize and protest get attention. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=193.96s)]
*  At the same time, it's sort of assumed that if you would just switch positions to what [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=195.96s)]
*  the sort of the Rashida Tlaibs want, that would solve his political problems and it [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=200.96s)]
*  would not. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=206.96s)]
*  You know, David's right about Michigan being on the teetering point for Biden. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=207.96s)]
*  If he went whole hog the other way, he'd probably lose Pennsylvania. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=213.08s)]
*  And he might. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=217.08s)]
*  And it's not obvious to me when you look at the numbers that that switching positions [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=218.08s)]
*  would gain him more votes than would lose him even in Michigan. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=224.08s)]
*  This all goes to the and I think this is part of Audie's point is like it's more the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=228.08s)]
*  generational thing that is a real threat to Biden than the Arab American or Muslim vote [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=232.08s)]
*  in Michigan. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=237.08s)]
*  And it just goes to the fact that his coalition is much bigger than Donald Trump's. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=238.08s)]
*  And therefore you can have people on different sides of issues in the same coalition. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  FDR had straight up Klansmen and communist Jews and blacks in his coalition. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, weird things happen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  Taking us back to that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  It was a big 10 party back then. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  And so I think that that that that he's just in a bad position where he is kind of in a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  no win political situation no matter what. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=260.2s)]
*  Yeah, I know the president and the administration has been walking this incredibly fine line [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=262.2s)]
*  for months now since October, in fact. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=267.2s)]
*  But, you know, I think the announcement that we're close to a ceasefire is a game changer, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=270.32s)]
*  especially going into Michigan tonight and especially going into the state of Union. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=275.32s)]
*  So I'm hearing a sense from the administration that they're sort of breathing a sigh of relief [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=279.32s)]
*  to some degree that there could be some pressure being let out the bow here. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=285.32s)]
*  And we'll but we'll see to everyone's point tonight how this plays out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=289.32s)]
*  But I don't think that there's any sort of here on fire concern because again, you know, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=293.32s)]
*  I think they think that this whole thing will be wrapped up and we still have eight more months. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=298.44s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=301.44s)]
*  I will say Max Foster earlier in the show was saying the Israelis are kind of throwing [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=302.44s)]
*  some cold water on what Biden had to say last night. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=305.44s)]
*  So I'm interested to see how that dynamic plays out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnIOmUxNxAg&t=307.44s)]
