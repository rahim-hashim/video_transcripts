# Jordan says ceasefire in Gaza only way to prevent region from the 'abyss of war'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc)
*  When and how will Iran strike back for Israel's assassination [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=0.0s)]
*  of Hezbollah's top military chief? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=6.0s)]
*  That question hanging over the Middle East this hour. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=8.84s)]
*  US sources say Iran and its affiliates [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=11.28s)]
*  are preparing to respond possibly in the coming days. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=14.32s)]
*  Right now, diplomats from Islamic nations [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=18.48s)]
*  are meeting in an emergency session in Saudi Arabia [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=20.48s)]
*  at Iran's request. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  They are expected to urge restraint from Tehran [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=26.68s)]
*  and condemn Israel over its suspected killing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=30.6s)]
*  of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Iran recently. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=33.92s)]
*  Yaya Sinwar, an alleged architect [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=40.24s)]
*  of the October 7 attacks, has been tapped to replace Haniyeh. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=43.08s)]
*  Among those working at that meeting in Jeddah, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=49.16s)]
*  Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=51.84s)]
*  has been conducting a flurry of talks to defuse tensions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=54.12s)]
*  He stopped in Iran on Sunday, the first such visit [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=59.36s)]
*  by a top Jordanian official in 20 years. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Simon Safadi stepping away from that meeting in Jeddah [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  to talk to us. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=70.24s)]
*  This is his first interview since he was in Tehran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=71.08s)]
*  And you have been with the acting foreign minister of Iran [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=74.92s)]
*  today, so I want to get your sense of Iran's thinking [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=78.4s)]
*  at this point as the region awaits [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=82.96s)]
*  for what is threatened retaliation by Iran on Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=86.19999999999999s)]
*  What do you understand to be Tehran's position at this point? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  And what are they trying to achieve with this meeting, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  foreign minister? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  Good evening, Biki. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  We are in a very, very dangerous situation in the region. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  Following the assassination of the head [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=111.52s)]
*  of the political bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=114.28s)]
*  tensions have risen, obviously. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=117.56s)]
*  What we in Jordan are saying is that the region cannot afford [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  further conflict, further war, further destruction, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  and we must stop this escalation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=128.48s)]
*  And the first step towards stopping the escalation [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=130.88s)]
*  is ending its root cause, which is the continued Israeli [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=133.72s)]
*  aggression on Gaza. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=137.8s)]
*  Everybody has to realize that the situation is extremely [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=142.16s)]
*  dangerous. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  The threat of the region being dragged into a regional war [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=146.4s)]
*  is real. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=150.16s)]
*  We do want this escalation to stop. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=151.52s)]
*  We've been working very hard to achieve that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=154.48s)]
*  And we're 100% convinced that the only, the first step [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  towards that escalation is stopping the aggression [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=163.28s)]
*  on Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=167.28s)]
*  Iran, obviously, I had discussions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  with the Iranian foreign minister, the Iranian president [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  in Tehran a few years ago. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  I went there, the invitation of the foreign minister [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=177.44s)]
*  to try and see what we can do to bring the temperature down. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=180.2s)]
*  They believe that they've been done a great wrong, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  and they believe they have the right to respond. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=188.32s)]
*  So what we're trying to do is, again, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=191.28s)]
*  to create the conditions in which everybody will see value [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=193.52s)]
*  in de-escalating, and that would be ending the aggression, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=199.4s)]
*  getting a permanent ceasefire, and then urging everybody [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  to act responsibly and prevent the whole region from falling [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=205.72s)]
*  into the abyss further. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=210.12s)]
*  While the US Secretary of State has said that the ceasefire [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=212.24s)]
*  talks are in their final stages, sources that I talk to around [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  this region suggest that we are not close at this point. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=219.16000000000003s)]
*  So given that, and given that the appeal to Iran [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=223.04s)]
*  has been from both you and others, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=228.0s)]
*  that a ceasefire is what we should be pushing for here [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=230.6s)]
*  and retaliation by default not, what is it that Tehran hopes [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=235.2s)]
*  to achieve today in Jeddah? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  Is this just a holding pattern at this point? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=244.12s)]
*  We're not going to get a ceasefire today or tomorrow. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  I think you and I would agree on that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=250.32s)]
*  So is this just a holding pattern at this point by Tehran? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Can we, do you believe, expect to see that threatened retaliation [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=257.48s)]
*  in the days to come? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=262.64s)]
*  Well, as I said, Becky, the danger is real. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=268.64s)]
*  I think our meeting today will not [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=271.0s)]
*  be able to bring about a ceasefire. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=272.44s)]
*  I think Iran and Palestine called for this emergency [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=274.4s)]
*  meeting to try and rally Arab Muslim position behind condemning [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=278.0s)]
*  the assassination of Haniya and to urge [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  for more effective work by the international community [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=287.2s)]
*  to end the aggression on Gaza. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  Again, I think we need to do something really [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=294.12s)]
*  transformative here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  I think regardless of where Iran is, where Israel is, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=298.56s)]
*  at this point, if we are to force Israel [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=302.12s)]
*  to accept a ceasefire and the aggression in Gaza, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=305.6s)]
*  ensure that we get that permanent ceasefire, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=309.0s)]
*  then we would have created enough reason for everybody [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=312.04s)]
*  to say enough is enough. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  Now we have an opportunity at real de-escalation [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=317.12s)]
*  and we should move towards that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=320.84000000000003s)]
*  So the talks on the ceasefire are obviously complicated, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  particularly after the assassination [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=326.6s)]
*  of the chief negotiator from the Hamas side, which is, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=328.76000000000005s)]
*  we believe, is a violation of international law [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=333.0s)]
*  and a reckless move that we condemned as a crime. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  But beyond that, where do we stand now? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=339.44s)]
*  We have two paths, a path that will drag the region further [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=341.96s)]
*  into the abyss of war or a path that would say enough is enough [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=345.24s)]
*  and save the region from the devastation of an all-out war. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=349.56s)]
*  And we believe that if we throw into the discourse [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=353.52s)]
*  a real promise of a ceasefire, then we believe everybody [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=360.24s)]
*  will have a strong argument to say, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=364.52000000000004s)]
*  let's not escalate any further, everybody must exercise [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=367.48s)]
*  their self-restraint and use the opportunity of a ceasefire [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=370.92s)]
*  to go further towards calming the temperature in the region at all. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  Ismail Haneer, described by the Qataris as the lead negotiator, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=379.48s)]
*  of course, for Hamas in those indirect talks, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=385.16s)]
*  his assassination is, as you suggest, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=389.16s)]
*  complicating any mediation effort. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=391.76s)]
*  Surely you accept that the appointment of Yair Sinwar, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=395.12s)]
*  seen as Israel, seen by Israel as the architect [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=400.92s)]
*  of the October 7th deadly attacks, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=405.04s)]
*  his appointment as the political leader for Hamas at this point, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  must further complicate the potential for any success [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=415.28s)]
*  in these ceasefire talks, doesn't it? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=420.8s)]
*  We are already in a very complex situation. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=427.36s)]
*  The war on Gaza has been ongoing for 10 months. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=430.52s)]
*  The devastation it has produced is beyond description. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  And we all rally behind efforts to bring about that exchange deal [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=437.52s)]
*  to reach that permanent ceasefire that we want. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=442.2s)]
*  But look, we've been to the door and back so many times [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=447.59999999999997s)]
*  in regards to the discussion. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  So I will not really say that we are near or not near [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  until we see that deal happening. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=456.36s)]
*  But I think the bottom line is that if there is a will [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=458.32s)]
*  to achieve that ceasefire, we believe that it can be achieved. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=461.8s)]
*  The challenge that we have is that every time we get near, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=466.03999999999996s)]
*  Israel does something that complicates the situation further, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=471.72s)]
*  including, as you pointed to, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=476.32000000000005s)]
*  the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in the middle of negotiations, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=479.44000000000005s)]
*  which the US, Qatar and Egypt were saying, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=483.44000000000005s)]
*  we are achieving some progress. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=485.92s)]
*  So you come and assassinate the chief negotiator, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=487.92s)]
*  undermine the whole process, and continue with the war on Gaza. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=491.48s)]
*  Our message to the whole world, Biki, is that enough is enough. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=495.44000000000005s)]
*  Enough killing and destruction has taken place. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=498.96s)]
*  The only path forward is really to bring about an immediate ceasefire [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=501.36s)]
*  that will help de-escalate the regional situation, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=505.24s)]
*  will save the region from the abyss of further conflict, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=509.68s)]
*  and will protect the region from the agenda of Netanyahu, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=513.76s)]
*  who continues to provoke, continues to escalate. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=517.28s)]
*  And every time there is a glimpse of hope, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=520.96s)]
*  he does something that pushes us back to the edge of the abyss. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=523.52s)]
*  So the question is, do we allow Netanyahu and his radical government [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=529.4s)]
*  to impose their agenda on the region [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=532.96s)]
*  and doom it therefore to a future of more conflict, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=535.12s)]
*  or do we do what we all believe is right [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=538.0s)]
*  and bring about that permanent and immediate ceasefire [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=540.6s)]
*  and then work with everybody to make sure that we are on a path [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=543.52s)]
*  that will ensure that everything that has happened since October 7 [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=546.76s)]
*  does not happen again? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=550.72s)]
*  Nothing on the table as of yet is going beyond tactical. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  We believe that we should start with ending the aggression [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=555.76s)]
*  and start talking strategically about how do we launch a plan [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=559.24s)]
*  to implement a solution that will guarantee [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=565.28s)]
*  we will not relive these horrors again, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=568.4s)]
*  and that only solution is ending the occupation [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=570.76s)]
*  and the two-state solution. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=574.48s)]
*  We cannot be capped by what Netanyahu is willing to accept [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=575.76s)]
*  or willing to allow. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=579.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, this has been the reality [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=581.0s)]
*  within which all proposals have been present thus far. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LXLMj8sRc&t=583.76s)]
