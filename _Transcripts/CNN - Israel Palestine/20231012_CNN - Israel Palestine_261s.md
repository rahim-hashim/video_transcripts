# Retired general: The issue with Palestinians leaving Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI)
*  Hundreds of thousands of reservists are now gathering at the border with Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=0.0s)]
*  six days after the Hamas terror attacks on Israel. The White House now says [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=4.44s)]
*  27 Americans were killed. 14 remain unaccounted for joining us now to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=9.16s)]
*  discuss his retired U. S. Army Brigadier General Peter Zwick. General [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=15.08s)]
*  Zwick, thank you so much for being with us. The White House has made it clear [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=18.64s)]
*  that recovering Americans being held hostage by Hamas is a key priority. How [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  do you see that playing out? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=27.88s)]
*  Well, it's um, it's uh, it's it's extraordinarily complicated because [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=31.68s)]
*  it's likely that that most of those Americans or a percentage of them are [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=38.16s)]
*  also Israeli citizens. Um and they're intermingled with the other hostages [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=45.04s)]
*  of countries. So um, my instinct is that we need to fall in and support the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  Israelis while they do the lead effort to work those hostages out. I don't [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=61.88s)]
*  think that it's right for negotiation. They can try. But after what Hamas has [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=68.76s)]
*  done, I don't think anybody's in a mood for that. But the problem is, is that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=74.72s)]
*  what will happen if Hamas, um, as they've shown extraordinary ruthless [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=79.76s)]
*  already, they're already so deep into us that into this that that you know, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=85.4s)]
*  they can perpetuate it. What do they do? For example, start pulling hostages [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=90.96s)]
*  out and shooting them if they're not getting their demands met. And at that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=95.64s)]
*  point, at what point do you go in with major forces or Israeli special [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=99.88s)]
*  operations or combined special? I don't know. It's devilishly complicated. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=106.28s)]
*  I believe there's a lot of midnight oil being burned in capitals. Um, and but [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=112.16s)]
*  what this does do is it just continues to show the depravity of Hamas. And I [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=118.28s)]
*  think a key angle is to try to as much as possible separate Hamas in Gaza from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=124.68s)]
*  Palestinian civilians that are caught in the middle of this and are also [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=132.48s)]
*  hostage to this awful situation. I want to expand on that point. General, is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=137.64s)]
*  there any potential for humanitarian corridors, ways for those civilians to [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=143.12s)]
*  get out of harm's way? What would your advice be? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=148.44s)]
*  Well, my advice would be and I'm so far away from this would be, um, well, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=152.84s)]
*  you've got to, you know, I know we're talking to the Egyptians and other [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  nations. Um, um, there would be a hard mission as well because how do you [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  manage the flow? There will be also a major effort to make sure that that, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=168.84s)]
*  uh, any any type of outflow. Where do the refugees go? Egypt, I don't think [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=174.88s)]
*  is ready to take on thousands or hundreds of thousands of displaced [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=184.48s)]
*  persons. This is really hard. Um, and I know in the whole discussion about [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  sending food and aid up through those quarters makes eminent sense. But do [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=199.6s)]
*  they? But does it get to the Palestinians who desperately needed in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=205.62s)]
*  the in the city? Or does it go into, uh, feed to feed the Hamas and and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=211.44s)]
*  continue? I'll make one other point about Hamas. How ruthless and how they [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=217.48s)]
*  purport to be supporting the Palestinians. The fact that even now [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  they're firing rockets out of built up out of built up Gaza shows they have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  no disregard. They have total disregard for the for the Palestinian citizens [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  who they are using for cover. And that should be, I don't know, through [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=239.72s)]
*  leaflets or narrative. Get out to the populations who to that Palestinian [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=243.83999999999997s)]
*  population that is key in all this million couple million of them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=250.04s)]
*  Brigadier General Peter's whack very much appreciate your time, sir. Thanks [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=254.92s)]
*  for joining us. Thank you for having me. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaVjqS6fbBI&t=258.08s)]
