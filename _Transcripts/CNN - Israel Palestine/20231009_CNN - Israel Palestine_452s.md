# Explosions go off during interview with American doctor trapped in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM)
*  We're following more breaking news right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=0.0s)]
*  New strikes in Gaza happening at this moment, which raises the question, is an Israeli ground [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=2.24s)]
*  invasion of Gaza imminent? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu promising to hit Hamas, and I'm quoting him right now, like [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=10.38s)]
*  never before. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=14.8s)]
*  Israel's defense minister is calling for a complete siege of Gaza, with another top Israeli [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=16.72s)]
*  official saying a ground war there is not off the table. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=21.84s)]
*  Now with some 2 million people crowded together on a 140 square mile piece of land in Gaza, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=25.96s)]
*  what kind of fighting would unfold in one of the most densely packed areas on earth? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=31.84s)]
*  Ben Wiedemann is out front in Jerusalem for us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=37.08s)]
*  Ben, I know you spent a lot of time reporting from Gaza. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=39.52s)]
*  You know how difficult that terrain is over there with urban areas, very crowded urban [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=42.84s)]
*  areas that lend themselves potentially to guerrilla warfare, and underground tunnels [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=47.74s)]
*  as well that could be booby trapped. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  What could the IDF forces be facing there? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=55.56s)]
*  It's going to be a huge challenge, Wolf, because the assumption is that they're going to go [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=60.6s)]
*  into Gaza in ways that we haven't seen in the past. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=66.84s)]
*  I was there in 2009 when the Israelis made a massive incursion into Gaza. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=70.84s)]
*  They basically cut the strip in three parts, but they avoided the most heavily populated [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=76.88s)]
*  areas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Now the assumption is if they're going to go in and try to, for instance, rescue the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  captives, the assumption is that Hamas is keeping them in areas that are heavily populated. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  For instance, like the Shanti refugee camp, the beach camp, which is one of the most densely [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=95.36s)]
*  populated of Gaza's eight refugee camps. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=100.24s)]
*  That refugee camp is composed of streets that are extremely narrow, so it's going to be [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  difficult for armor to get in. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=111.76s)]
*  And of course, it is so full of people that it is inevitable that civilians will be killed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=114.0s)]
*  And of course, everyone knows there are no bomb shelters for civilians in Gaza. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=121.12s)]
*  So this is going to be a very difficult, very violent operation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  And of course, Hamas, as we've seen, this operation that they this attack they launched [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=132.24s)]
*  on Saturday was very well prepared. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=138.24s)]
*  They clearly studied this operation long in advance and taking captives was clearly one [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  of the essential parts of that operation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=150.84s)]
*  And their assumption is probably that they have planned for the Israeli counterattack, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli invasion inside of Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=161.28s)]
*  So we've seen their capabilities are much greater than they have been in the past as [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=164.2s)]
*  well, speaking of Hamas. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  And therefore, the Israelis are probably going to be facing perhaps the most difficult ground [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=171.12s)]
*  operation they have done, at least since their incursion into south Lebanon in 2006. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=176.96s)]
*  I've been to Gaza, I've reported from Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=184.52s)]
*  I can confirm everything you're saying. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=187.36s)]
*  Ben Wiedemann, thank you very much. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=188.76s)]
*  And out front now, Dr. Barbara Zinn. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=190.68s)]
*  She's an American pediatrician who is stuck in Gaza right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  She was there on a medical mission to treat children when Hamas launched his terror attack [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=197.12s)]
*  on Israel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=201.76s)]
*  Dr. Zinn, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  I know you're hearing these airstrikes that are going on in Gaza right now. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=204.64s)]
*  It must be very, very scary. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=209.16s)]
*  What have you been experiencing? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, I was I happened to be walking on the beach with a high volunteer of the Palestinian [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=215.16s)]
*  Children's Relief Fund and working with was walking with one of their employees and his [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=219.28s)]
*  daughter on the beach when things started. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  We went for a walk at about six and about six thirty could see some missiles and the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=226.68s)]
*  Iron Dome missiles, you know, encountering them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  And yeah, since then, we were told to stay in the hotel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  There was two of us here and we were just waiting to to leave, really. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=239.72s)]
*  As you know, Israel has been striking various targets in Gaza throughout the day in response [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=246.68s)]
*  to the Hamas terror attacks that have been going on against Israel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  You were there on a routine mission, a very important mission to to take care of children. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=254.96s)]
*  Were you prepared at all for this? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=260.16s)]
*  Well, whenever you go to Gaza, you always know that there is there's danger of some violence [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=264.44s)]
*  while you're there. But no, I wasn't prepared for this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=268.88s)]
*  Let us know if you need to go into some sort of a bomb shelter or whatever, because I can [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=275.72s)]
*  hear those explosions going off right near you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=279.76s)]
*  Thank you. There are no bombs here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=282.64s)]
*  Is there any safe area that you can go to? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I actually have a sister in law is Palestinian. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=289.96s)]
*  She tells me to stay away from the windows. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm away from the window, stay by corners of walls that are more fortified and open [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=294.88s)]
*  your mouth so your your your drums don't break if there's a lot of pressure. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=300.96s)]
*  So I'm following her advice and I'm in a safe part of the room. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=306.52s)]
*  I don't know if you heard, but the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=311.76s)]
*  doctor, is warning that Israel will go after Hamas. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=315.24s)]
*  And I'm quoting him now like never before. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=318.32s)]
*  There's been calls for a complete siege of Gaza. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=321.56s)]
*  A ground invasion is not off the table either. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=324.12s)]
*  How worried are you right now for your own safety? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=327.36s)]
*  Well, we're doing what we can to try to get evacuated. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=332.12s)]
*  The organization I volunteer with, Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=336.8s)]
*  is working hard and we're developing plans to go down to the Ra'a border. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  And so those plans, we're going as fast as we can to to enact that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  You're trying to leave that southern border of Gaza into Egypt, is that right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  Right, right. So we have to get a visa into Egypt. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=357.44000000000005s)]
*  So we're waiting for the permission from the Egyptian government. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  Our State Department is helping a little with that. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=363.6s)]
*  And then the biggest concern is that it's about an hour, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  45 minutes to an hour to drive from Gaza City down to Ra'a. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=370.28s)]
*  And so the worry is that the Israelis will bomb the vehicle that we're in. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=373.68s)]
*  And so we're working on trying to get some cooperation for them. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=381.2s)]
*  As far as your discussions with the State Department about evacuating, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=385.96s)]
*  what are they telling you tonight? What are they saying? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=389.44s)]
*  Stay put, shelter in place or try to get into a car and drive off the border with Egypt? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  They're not really giving us advice. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  They're telling us what's open and then. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and then they're going to help us get the visa. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=407.52s)]
*  But they're not giving us advice on how to get to the border or anything at this point. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=410.64s)]
*  I don't know that they could. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=415.32s)]
*  And just before I let you go, Dr. Zind, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=418.76s)]
*  I know that you've got a lot going on. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=420.68s)]
*  Just a few moments ago, we heard we heard that huge explosion over your head. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=422.56s)]
*  What was it like hearing that? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=427.4s)]
*  Well, I get startled by them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  They're not direct hits to my hotel, and I feel like this our hotel is safe. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  But but they're startling and I'm wary of them. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=438.28s)]
*  And I just take the precautions that I described before. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=442.24s)]
*  Well, Dr. Zind, good luck to you. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=445.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  OK, thank you. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5AxIqP6OJM&t=450.48s)]
