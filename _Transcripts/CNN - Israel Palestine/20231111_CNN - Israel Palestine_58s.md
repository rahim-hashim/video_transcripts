# Hundreds of thousands join pro-Palestinian rally in London
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw)
*  Palestine will be free! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=0.0s)]
*  I am very much for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=2.0s)]
*  I am for a political solution because I think that's the only way that this conflict is ever going to be solved. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=7.0s)]
*  We are here for peace. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=15.0s)]
*  We are here to protest for Palestine and everything that's happening. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=21.0s)]
*  We want Israel to ceasefire as they are killing lots of innocent children. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=25.0s)]
*  What you need to realise, and I think everyone needs to realise, is that the level and the extent of suffering is greater than that which we have seen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=30.0s)]
*  We have gathered today to show that in our millions and in our billions we are all truly Palestinian. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=40.0s)]
*  Anyone shouldn't kill innocent children or innocent lives, it doesn't matter if it's war or not war, but there should be certain rules that everyone should follow. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=45.0s)]
*  I can have sympathy for two sets of people. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKdsZJFhRw&t=53.0s)]
