# Video shows extensive airstrikes on Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg)
*  I want to go back to Nick Robertson who was there on the ground in Sarot in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=0.0s)]
*  Nick, what are you seeing right now? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=5.44s)]
*  Yeah, Donna, I just told you when we were speaking a couple of minutes ago there was two minutes of silence. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=9.44s)]
*  It's not silent anymore. The guns have picked up again. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=14.0s)]
*  We're hearing the fighter jets, hearing explosions, some of them very heavy behind us here right now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=17.44s)]
*  Also, we just saw a flash on the skyline. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=22.8s)]
*  We didn't hear an explosion from that which indicates it could be distance away from us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=26.8s)]
*  But if we had a sense here a few minutes ago that the intense bombardment of earlier might have been easing off, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=31.6s)]
*  I think the last two minutes here while you've been talking to the congressman, it has really picked up and intensified again. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=40.6s)]
*  I think it will do this for some time, the fluctuation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=48.6s)]
*  We'll hear guns, artillery firing out from this direction. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=53.4s)]
*  Possibly we'll hear the impacts in Gaza behind us. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=56.4s)]
*  But some of the impacts have been exceptionally loud, exceptionally strong. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=60.4s)]
*  You can feel them shaking the ground here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=65.4s)]
*  Not clear precisely what the targets are other than Hamas and its infrastructure. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=68.4s)]
*  Not quite clear how the rest of the night will roll out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=74.4s)]
*  But what we are feeling and seeing from here right now is quantifiably a step up from previous night, Stana. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=79.2s)]
*  And I just want to underscore something that you talked about earlier and that Alex Marquardt has been reporting on, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=86.2s)]
*  Becky Anderson as well, which is sources saying that there were significant discussions, progress in those discussions about hostages. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=93.2s)]
*  More than 200 hostages being held on the other side of the border from where you are, Nick. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=104.0s)]
*  And the question that you posed as you're seeing the increase in action there and military action right before your eyes, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=109.0s)]
*  how that could impact the ability to get the hostages out and whether there is any connection anymore at this point. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=117.0s)]
*  Yeah, the diplomacy around the table is in essence hostages for humanitarian aid, humanitarian pause, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=125.8s)]
*  or we understand Hamas has at some point asked for a five-day ceasefire. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=135.8s)]
*  Israel has been very clear all along. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=141.8s)]
*  It is not about to have a ceasefire. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=143.8s)]
*  There's been increasing pressure and using different language from different countries, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=146.8s)]
*  the European Union putting pressure for a kind of humanitarian pause. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  You're probably seeing some of the flashes behind me there of some of the strikes that are underway. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  We're hearing the fighter jet. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  That blast that you heard there, I'm assuming you could hear it, was the sort of thing we've just been hearing repeated, repeated, repeated, repeated over the past few hours. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=167.60000000000002s)]
*  There have been a missile coming from a fighter jet because I'm hearing it fly away. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=178.4s)]
*  But the idea that Hamas was talking about a ceasefire, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=182.4s)]
*  the idea that the hostage release could come about as part of a deal where there would be a cessation in the fighting, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=186.4s)]
*  this is all diplomacy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=194.4s)]
*  But there's another part of the equation and that's the military part. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=196.4s)]
*  In this diplomacy, both sides go toe to toe, make their demands, wait for the other side to take concessions. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=199.4s)]
*  These are concessions, as we say, over fuel into Gaza or humanitarian aid. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  But there are also, the two sides are going toe to toe in military terms as well, waiting for the other to back down. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  It was only a few hours ago that Hamas was firing rockets into Tel Aviv that hit an apartment there, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  the IDF clearly stepping up its action in this part of Gaza tonight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  So these are all ways of pressuring the other side and where the talks now stand as there is not a clear pause in the military offensive. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=228.0s)]
*  In fact, the reverse, I would say, an escalation over earlier in the day. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=238.0s)]
*  And I think it's worth just pointing out at this point, a week ago today, Friday last week, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=242.0s)]
*  there was intense diplomacy behind the scenes for the release of those two hostages, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=247.0s)]
*  the American hostages, the mother and the daughter. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=253.0s)]
*  They were released late Friday night. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=255.0s)]
*  Well, in absolute contrast to today, Thursday and Friday last week were very quiet in military terms. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=257.8s)]
*  We barely heard any shelling or any aircraft strikes. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=264.8s)]
*  Compare and contrast that to now, to today, and you get that real sense that if it took two days of pause to release two hostages, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=268.8s)]
*  absent any pause, absent perhaps the release of 50 hostages. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=278.8s)]
*  All right, Nick, stand by, please. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=283.6s)]
*  And please let us know if there's anything we need to come right back to you for. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=285.6s)]
*  But I want to get to Jeremy Diamond, who was also in Israel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=289.6s)]
*  Jeremy, what are you hearing from sources there? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=292.6s)]
*  Well, Dana, just like Nick, I mean, we are here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=297.6s)]
*  We heard earlier in the day that there was perhaps some progress in these hostage negotiations. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=300.6s)]
*  But now what we are hearing are the sounds of war, the most intense bombing, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=304.6s)]
*  at least in terms of what I can hear from my position here in Ashkelon that I have heard in the nearly three weeks that I have been here covering this war. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  We are hearing intense and repetitive, percussive thuds, bombing, artillery also clearly going out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  And what we're also seeing is Hamas responding with at least two rocket barrages towards central Israel, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  as well as right here towards Ashkelon within the last 20, 30 minutes or so. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  This is certainly taking on a different tone and tenor from here. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=338.2s)]
*  It's hard to say if this is the beginning of that invasion that we have been expecting from the IDF, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  that they have made clear that will be happening at some point. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=349.0s)]
*  We know, Dana, that in recent days, Israeli officials had clearly told the Americans that they were willing to give them a few days to see how these hostage negotiations developed. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  And while we don't know officially whether those talks have completely collapsed, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=362.4s)]
*  what is clear is that Israeli officials were not going to wait indefinitely in order to move forward with their ground campaign. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=366.4s)]
*  Again, we don't know whether that is what we are starting to see on the ground. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=373.4s)]
*  But what we are seeing is certainly an intensification of strikes on Gaza. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=377.4s)]
*  There are also reports of telecommunications being out in Gaza. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=382.4s)]
*  And in addition to that, we know that in recent days we have seen a stepped up pace, not only of the airstrikes, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=386.4s)]
*  not only of the targeting of those Hamas tunnels underneath Gaza, but also increasing raids inside of Gaza. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=392.4s)]
*  At least over the last two nights, there have been tanks going into Gaza to carry out targeted raids, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=398.4s)]
*  as the IDF describes them, to take out some of those tunnels, to take out some of Hamas's infrastructure. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=404.4s)]
*  And what we also saw last night was the Flotilla 13, which is Israel's equivalent of the Navy SEALs, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=410.4s)]
*  going into southern Gaza via the sea and carrying out a raid there as well. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=417.4s)]
*  All of that in the lead up to what we are now hearing, Dana, which again is a very serious intensification of airstrikes, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=422.4s)]
*  much louder bombing than we have heard perhaps in these nearly three weeks of this war. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=429.4s)]
*  Jeremy, thank you. Stand by as well. I want to bring in General Mark Hurtling, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=436.4s)]
*  who was the commanding general of the United States Army Europe and the Seventh Army. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=440.4s)]
*  General, what are you seeing when you hear our reporters and you see the images that we are? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=446.4s)]
*  Well, specifically, Dana, what I'd say is Nick's reporting is excellent from northern Gaza. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=454.4s)]
*  I'd be interested in what's happening in the south. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=460.4s)]
*  Jeremy just talked a little bit about what's happening in the most southern extreme of Gaza with the Israeli Navy, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=462.4s)]
*  but what also is happening in Khan Younis. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=469.4s)]
*  Are there the same kind of explosions going on in those areas? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=471.4s)]
*  Because I think the Israeli Defense Forces are going to hit all sectors of Gaza. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=475.4s)]
*  But what you've seen, as Jeremy just pointed out over the last several days, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=479.4s)]
*  an increase in airstrikes, an increase in intelligence probes by ground forces, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=483.4s)]
*  which went into Gaza and then came out, which tells me they were seeking more intelligence, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=490.4s)]
*  more targeting data for a final push. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=496.4s)]
*  So what you're seeing primarily, I believe, from the Air Force and perhaps even artillery fire [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=499.4s)]
*  from outside of Gaza is a preparatory stance by Israel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=505.4s)]
*  They are conducting final prep fires, putting a lot of forces in it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=510.4s)]
*  And remember, these weapons don't just kill what they're bombing Gaza with and hitting them with artillery. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=515.4s)]
*  It's also psychological. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=522.4s)]
*  When you're under that kind of fire as a terrorist operation, you know something big is happening. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=524.4s)]
*  And they've been under these kind of bombs for the last 20 days. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=530.4s)]
*  At the same time, as Nick so rightly pointed out, the Israeli Defense Forces have been mobilized almost 20 days now. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=534.4s)]
*  You can't just keep a large force of 300,000 waiting in a field for that long. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=541.4s)]
*  They tend to start losing their edge. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=547.4s)]
*  And the Israeli government, the one, Mr. Netanyahu, who's going to literally pull the trigger and start the operation, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=549.4s)]
*  and all indicators are he's been holding back because of divisions within his cabinet, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=557.4s)]
*  when he does that, he has to have the full force of the attack going. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=563.4s)]
*  Whether or not ground forces are going to come in and go back out or come in writ large and stay, that's yet to be determined. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=568.4s)]
*  But I'd suggest it probably tonight or tomorrow we're going to see some of the major effort of the Israeli Defense Force [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=576.4s)]
*  going in with main forces to strike some of the targets that they've been collecting intelligence on. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SVwfkHvlNg&t=586.4s)]
