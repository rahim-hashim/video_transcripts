# CNN asks Netanyahu, ‘how much is too much?’ Hear his response
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY)
*  More than 40,000 Palestinians have now been killed in Gaza, a majority of whom are civilians. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=0.0s)]
*  And these numbers are from the Palestinian Ministry of Health, but they are backed up [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=5.32s)]
*  by the United States, by international organizations. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=8.52s)]
*  Humanitarian conditions in Gaza have degraded so much that diseases like polio and hepatitis [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=11.84s)]
*  A are now spreading. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=16.72s)]
*  We have seen countless children be orphaned. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=18.42s)]
*  We have seen countless mothers lose their children. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  How much is too much, sir? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=23.88s)]
*  At what point is it time to end this war? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=25.64s)]
*  Well, we will end the war when we achieve our war goals of making sure that Hamas can't [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=28.36s)]
*  repeat such atrocities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=32.56s)]
*  But we are fighting this war, a just war with just means, in fact with means that no other [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=34.56s)]
*  army has ever fought. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=39.56s)]
*  No other army has taken the precautions that Israel has taken, sometimes at great risk, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=42.86s)]
*  to make sure that we minimize the number of casualties. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=49.96s)]
*  You talked about polio. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=52.72s)]
*  We enable now massive vaccination of polio. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=55.36s)]
*  We want 90% of the people of Gaza vaccinated. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=60.0s)]
*  I think 200,000 I think were vaccinated today. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=65.84s)]
*  We put in a million tons of food, a million tons of aid, 700,000 tons of food. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=71.68s)]
*  That's unheard of. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=76.76s)]
*  We've taken, because we think that every civilian death is a tragedy. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=77.76s)]
*  For Hamas, every civilian death is a strategy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  For us, it's a tragedy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=85.16s)]
*  There are 1.4 million people in Gaza. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=87.2s)]
*  They moved from the north to the south. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=89.08s)]
*  You're going to have thousands, 20,000 killed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=92.2s)]
*  You're going to have a catastrophe, a humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=97.88s)]
*  They have no place to go, no food to eat. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Now report honestly, because here's what happened. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=106.6s)]
*  They all left. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=111.72s)]
*  They went to the humanitarian zone, which is two miles away, less, on the beach. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=113.48s)]
*  They have tents. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=118.92s)]
*  We supplied tents for 150,000 people. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=120.5s)]
*  The aid agencies supplied the rest, and some of them carried their own tents. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=123.04s)]
*  They have a place. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  We supplied water lines, sewage lines, food. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  There's more to be done. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  Medical. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=133.76s)]
*  So now we know how many people were killed, how many terrorists, because we counted them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=135.76s)]
*  We just passed 2,000. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=141.4s)]
*  Terrorists, body counts of terrorists. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=143.4s)]
*  The people left. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=147.28s)]
*  How many civilians died? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  I asked the commander, the commander of the division that did the Rafah operation and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=150.24s)]
*  the Philadelphia Corridor. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=157.8s)]
*  He said, Prime Minister, there are hardly any civilian deaths because everybody left. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=160.36s)]
*  They heeded our warnings. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=168.0s)]
*  But he said there were probably two dozen, and most of them occurred when one of our [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=170.18s)]
*  bombs hit a Hamas ammunition depot that was planted inside a residential area. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=180.34s)]
*  40 people died, about 20 were terrorists, about 20 were civilians. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=186.3s)]
*  He said that's most of the deaths. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=189.82s)]
*  That's the lowest ratio of non-combatants to combatants in the history of urban warfare. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=193.38s)]
*  That's it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=202.62s)]
*  Now report honestly, because you accused us of something that is outrageous, and in fact [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=204.18s)]
*  the accusations against us are outrageously false. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Humanitarian aid? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  A million trucks of aid? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  A million tons of aid? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=216.78s)]
*  700,000 tons of food? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=218.94s)]
*  A deliberate starvation policy? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=222.34s)]
*  You can say anything. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=224.38000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't make it true. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=225.38000000000002s)]
*  You repeat a lie over and over and over again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=227.3s)]
*  It assumes the cache of self-evident truth, but it's false. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=229.78s)]
*  Israel is doing and the Israeli army is doing something that no other army has done in history [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=233.82000000000002s)]
*  and will continue to do that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=240.74s)]
*  I'm not going to change my policies. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=241.82000000000002s)]
*  Humanitarian policies, vaccination policies, combat policies to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CfrPcQYCY&t=244.14000000000001s)]
