# Israel delays cabinet vote on Gaza truce saying Hamas has reneged on parts of deal
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY)
*  Breaking news overnight. A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is still in place, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=0.0s)]
*  There is at the very least a new delay this morning that everyone is trying to get a better handle on what it really means [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=6.24s)]
*  Here's what we know at this hour [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=12.92s)]
*  Israel's cabinet needs to vote to ratify the deal that has not happened as it was expected to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=15.36s)]
*  Israel delayed it citing last-minute issues again what this now means exactly [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=21.56s)]
*  For the phased in ceasefire and hostage deal. It's unclear [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=27.259999999999998s)]
*  It's all supposed to begin on Sunday under the deal Hamas has agreed to release 33 hostages in the first phase [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=31.5s)]
*  Israel agreed to release a thousand plus Palestinian prisoners all of that resulting in a 42 day ceasefire with hopes [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=37.74s)]
*  It leads to a permanent one. Let's get to CNN's beyond a goal of driga [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=45.22s)]
*  She's live in Tel Aviv with much more on this beyond to help us understand. What is the status here? What is the latest? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=48.78s)]
*  Okay, good morning to you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=57.540000000000006s)]
*  So all of these things remain rather fluid [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  but the latest it does appear to be just a delay in the process of getting a security cabinet and ultimately a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=63.14s)]
*  Party cabinet vote in the government here as you noted Prime Minister [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=71.10000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu blaming Hamas for what he says is reneging on parts of the deal Hamas for their part are denying [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=75.7s)]
*  Those allegations everyone I'm speaking with here still believes though that a ceasefire deal [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Will go into place as had been agreed upon beginning Sunday night where we would see the first [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=88.84s)]
*  hostages in phase one of those 33 [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=95.4s)]
*  Released here to Israel hospitals have been on standby and ready to receive [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  Those hostages in terms of the politics of it all Prime Minister [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu is facing a lot of headwinds as we've been reporting now for months from the far-right elements specifically of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=109.64s)]
*  His government of his coalition who do not want to agree to a deal under these terms [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=117.08s)]
*  What the latest we have is that finance minister Betsel El Smocric has said that his party would agree to stay with [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=122.32s)]
*  The coalition through phase one of the deal that is the release of those 33 hostages and the pause in fighting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=130.24s)]
*  Only if the fighting would be allowed to proceed again after phase one [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=138.78s)]
*  So there you just get a sense of how fluid and fragile this deal is right now [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=143.46s)]
*  But Kate when it comes to the hostages coming home in phase one as you noted it would be the women it would be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=149.14s)]
*  Children it would be men over the age of 50 and those who are critically wounded and among those women are five [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=157.06s)]
*  IDF spotters our soldiers reminder that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=163.86s)]
*  Everyone in Israel is required to serve in the military these five IDF spotters all young the ages of 19 [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=167.34s)]
*  To 21 I spoke with the cousin of one of them that a Gomburgers cousin. She is 20 years old [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=175.18s)]
*  I spoke with her cousin about what this moment may feel like for them when they are finally [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=181.78s)]
*  Reunited and why there's a bittersweet sense in the country right now [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=187.78s)]
*  She's a beautiful young girl [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=193.94s)]
*  Who's been 15 months in the hands of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=197.1s)]
*  People that we know [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=201.34s)]
*  Committed the worst atrocities against women in one day [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=203.78s)]
*  We know what they did on October 7th [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=208.62s)]
*  We also know from released hostages who came home what they did to hostages in captivity [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=211.74s)]
*  That's the biggest fear the physical aspect of it [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=219.46s)]
*  And I don't need to go into detail. I think everyone who's watching understands what that fear means [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=223.62s)]
*  But more importantly the mental and emotional aspect of what kind of trauma [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  Something like that can do to a young girl who's 20 years old who has her whole life ahead of hers [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=235.38s)]
*  All right, Bianna go Lidriga for us in Tel Aviv. Yeah, it's gonna be all over a lot of developments could be coming on this today [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=241.38s)]
*  David Sanger, let me start with you. You of course have been covering this deal closely [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=248.02s)]
*  Is there anything to this last-minute hiccup with the Israeli cabinet? How serious is that here? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=252.5s)]
*  It could be we don't know yet [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=258.5s)]
*  I do know that up to the last few hours before they announced the agreement yesterday Casey [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=260.36s)]
*  Hamas was coming up with sort of last-minute things. They were putting on the table. It's a very usual [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=266.94s)]
*  Technique on their part and the question is can that be put down? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=273.14s)]
*  But the bigger question is who's right under in this dispute between the two and the answer is really both [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=277.26s)]
*  So the deal is essentially what? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  President Biden laid out in May it also you may notice this is January [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=287.26s)]
*  So, you know that deal did not happen and I think the fact that they did link up so well and that Steve [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=292.14s)]
*  Witkoff who was president Trump's [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=299.09999999999997s)]
*  Incoming Mideast advisor was out there in lockstep with Brett McGurk who was President Biden's equivalent for that and has worked for [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=302.41999999999996s)]
*  Republican presidents as well [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=311.41999999999996s)]
*  I think that made the difference because they were able to go to Netanyahu sent Witkoff and say [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=313.41999999999996s)]
*  This is the deal that Trump wants and I think that sort of helped put it over the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  Marker David Tom Malinowski, who's a former Democratic congressman [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=324.17999999999995s)]
*  He put out a very interesting thread on Twitter the first of which says that this was Biden's deal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=330.5s)]
*  But as much as I hate to say it he couldn't have done it without Trump not so much Trump's performative threats to Hamas [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=336.1s)]
*  But his willingness to tell BB bluntly that the war had to end [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=342.5s)]
*  By January 20th and he essentially goes on to say that while Biden did a great job working with European leaders [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=347.98s)]
*  He did not bring the sort of thuggery to the table that is required in the Middle East [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=354.98s)]
*  Do you think Malinowski's right about this? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=360.74s)]
*  I think he's absolutely right and and the reason that I would say that is first of all the relationship between [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=362.74s)]
*  President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=368.94s)]
*  poisonous would be a polite phrase for the for the term, okay, and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=372.06s)]
*  second [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=376.98s)]
*  the fact that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=378.22s)]
*  They were able to send with cough not Brett McGurk but with cough on Saturday to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=380.5s)]
*  See Netanyahu and say [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=386.70000000000005s)]
*  President Trump wants this resolve before inauguration day in part so that it's not on him [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  To go, you know be the one who was squeezing the Israelis. I don't think the Israelis would have made the deal [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=397.06s)]
*  I think they would have just said well, let's just see what we get out of Trump interesting at Mike Dubke [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=402.12s)]
*  Well first on a serious matter [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=407.54s)]
*  What's what's amazing to me is America matters? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=410.86s)]
*  I mean that's the at the end of the day what other country we can have this argument about Trump or Biden [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=414.06s)]
*  But what other country can step into an international conflict and really have the level of influence that we did [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=419.42s)]
*  In this so to to to David's point. I mean America matters on that more of a light-hearted side [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=425.18s)]
*  I'm sick and tired of these two arguing about golf scores [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=431.18s)]
*  I'm sick and tired of these two arguing about who mattered the fact that these two [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=434.3s)]
*  Gentlemen got together told their people to get this done. That's what's important here [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=439.5s)]
*  I wish they would just both take the victory and and and be happy that we have a ceasefire after all these months [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=444.42s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a what do you make I mean, obviously the president Biden we have seen clearly doesn't is not ready to exit [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=450.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, especially the world stage [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  You know, it's it's a place that he is always really, you know [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=457.54s)]
*  He's valued his role as even when he was in the Senate and he was on the Foreign Relations Committee [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=461.1s)]
*  He clearly [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=466.82s)]
*  Doesn't want to give all the credit to Donald Trump [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=468.42s)]
*  But I will say the people that work for him have been willing to do it [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=471.48s)]
*  Yeah, look I grew up Mike. I think people across the country are sick of the back and forth [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=474.26s)]
*  I think people want to see some bipartisanship and so for the start of this new administration [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=479.02s)]
*  I think this is a good sign that there could be some glimmers of hope for bipartisanship [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=483.65999999999997s)]
*  But secondly, look, I think President Biden the Vice President Harris have been clear about their stance on this and they've worked very hard [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=488.26s)]
*  To get here. And so yes, I do think Donald Trump helped push this over [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=494.42s)]
*  But I don't want to take the credit away from the president the vice president. They were very clear about this deal [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=497.94s)]
*  They're very dogged about it. They wish this would have happened in May, but it did not but I think you're right [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=503.42s)]
*  President Biden's having a hard time this week. He has a couple of days left in office. He's enjoyed been president [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=507.58s)]
*  It was not his choice not be president [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=512.04s)]
*  Let's just be honest about that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=513.7s)]
*  But it's gonna be tough for him as he watches Donald Trump takes to take office again [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=515.06s)]
*  You remember when he took office a couple years ago, he went to save this save this country soul [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=518.86s)]
*  He doesn't really feel like he's done that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=523.38s)]
*  So I think I do think there's some things that he's grappling with over the next couple days [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=525.4200000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna be tough for him David one thing that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=529.02s)]
*  Has hung over this deal is of course if assuming that that this stays on track and we see these hostage releases [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=532.9s)]
*  On Sunday is going to be the imagery and the parallels for an outgoing President Biden with an outgoing [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=540.26s)]
*  President Carter, let's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=547.22s)]
*  Jimmy Carter reflected a little bit on this dynamic back in an interview did in 2015 [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=549.34s)]
*  I want to watch that and then we'll talk about it. I [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=553.94s)]
*  Hadn't been to bed [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=557.82s)]
*  For three days and three nights. I had just been negotiating with the Iranians and with 12 other countries [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=559.46s)]
*  to get this release of our hostages who had been in prison for more than a year and [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  At 9 o'clock that morning [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=572.3000000000001s)]
*  They were already in the airplane ready to take off from Tehran [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=574.6999999999999s)]
*  But I told her many kept him there until after I was no longer president [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=577.9399999999999s)]
*  And your colleague Peter Baker and his analysis mentioned that this was has been hanging over the I mean [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=582.74s)]
*  This is something the White House is very aware of the president's aides have been very aware of [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=587.88s)]
*  How does this kind of echo today? Well, first of all, this could well spill into Monday [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=591.6999999999999s)]
*  It could spill beyond a Hamas at various moments made the argument [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc3c8Jg55GY&t=596.9399999999999s)]
