# Mothers reunite with newborn babies evacuated from a Gaza hospital
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8)
*  With the dire conditions in Gaza, babies born prematurely and their mothers are facing huge challenges as they try to find adequate care. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=0.0s)]
*  CNN's Larry Modowo takes us inside one hospital. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=8.0s)]
*  Every breath is a miracle for these babies born prematurely during the war in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=14.0s)]
*  They're here because Israeli forces ordered the Al-Shifa hospital in the north evacuated, claiming Hamas terrorists operated from there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=20.0s)]
*  Baby formula is the only source of nutrition here. Many of the mothers have not been found yet. Nobody knows if they're alive or dead. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=29.0s)]
*  Shaima Abu Khattar just arrived and is meeting her daughter for the first time since she was born 38 days ago. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=39.0s)]
*  Your father says to tell you that he loves you. She tells baby Kenda, her voice breaking. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=49.0s)]
*  This is the closest she can get to her own child. She was incubated as soon as she was born. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=55.0s)]
*  We were under siege in the north. I didn't know anything about my daughter. We had no connectivity. When the truce came, I found out that she was in Egypt. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=65.0s)]
*  Kenda and 11 other preterm babies from Al-Shifa came to the new capital, administrative hospital in Cairo, over two weeks ago. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=73.0s)]
*  Nine more have arrived from across Gaza since. How relieved are you to be able to see your baby finally? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=81.0s)]
*  I'm very happy, thank God. Today I felt like a mother because I've never seen her before. I just want to hold her and touch her. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=89.0s)]
*  Doctors say she'll be able to hold her daughter soon. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=99.0s)]
*  All the babies in this neonatal intensive care unit are under six weeks old and yet they have already been through so much in their short lives. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=103.0s)]
*  A war and a risky journey across the border from the Gaza Strip to here in the Egyptian capital. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=113.0s)]
*  Salsan Abou Amsha gave birth to twin girls two months early, just six days after the Israel-Hamas war started in the north. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=121.0s)]
*  There were airstrikes and heavy bombardment, the dead everywhere. It all weighed down on me, so I had labor pains and cramps. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=131.0s)]
*  They took me to Shifa Hospital and I spent a week in the ICU. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=138.0s)]
*  One of the girls has been discharged from the NICU and she can breastfeed her in the nursery, but the twin sister remains in an incubator. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=144.0s)]
*  Their mother never thought she would see them again. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=152.0s)]
*  Shifa was under siege. Out of despair, I lost hope and I left. I wanted to take my girls with me, but the doctors said if I did, they would die. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=157.0s)]
*  They said to leave them and God would protect them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=166.0s)]
*  Doctors say all the babies are doing better than when they arrived in Cairo. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=170.0s)]
*  Most of the cases are growing well, increasing in weight, become good general condition, tolerate oral feeding. Some problems in some patients are not too much. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=174.0s)]
*  In fact, eight have made it out of the NICU into this nursery, but reuniting them with their parents might be harder than saving their lives. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=185.0s)]
*  We know only the name for the mother, but we don't know where the mother is now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pu4xNukFz8&t=193.0s)]
