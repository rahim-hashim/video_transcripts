*  Thousands of miles away in the U.S., family members across three states are united in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=37.52s)]
*  grief. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=42.36s)]

*  That's my cousin, his son. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=51.36s)]
*  Three generations gone in a single day. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=52.82s)]
*  Back to back airstrikes, the family says, in Gaza, killing 42 relatives, the youngest [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=56.24s)]
*  just three months old. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=62.080000000000005s)]

*  A video shot by a neighbor shows charred ruins and rubble, all that's left of the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=65.56s)]
*  Sakala family compound. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=70.52000000000001s)]
*  We've never seen in this day and age where the whole world is watching innocent people [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=72.64s)]
*  just being torn apart. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=78.2s)]
*  Family, whole families just wiped off the map. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  The family blames the deaths on Israeli airstrikes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=84.04s)]
*  CNN cannot independently confirm that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Israel has launched numerous airstrikes on Gaza City since the terror attacks on October [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  7, including multiple strikes in the area that day. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=96.56s)]
*  The Israel Defense Forces did not comment on the purported airstrikes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  I mean, in my family members, we have no Hamas members. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=104.2s)]
*  They're just ordinary people, doctors and grandmothers and grandfathers and uncles and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  aunts and children. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you want to exterminate Hamas, you should go to the source. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  Among the dead, four brothers, all doctors. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=122.04s)]
*  Family members say they operated Gaza's largest network of family-owned eye clinics. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=125.56s)]
*  An independent journalist on the ground captured the aftermath. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=130.4s)]
*  In the moment, survivors pulled body after body from beneath the rubble, including Mona [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=134.0s)]
*  Abu Shaban's uncle, his wife and son. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=139.84s)]
*  The three had recently left their home in a different part of the city to stay at the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=143.36s)]
*  Sakala compound, Mona says. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=147.16s)]
*  Their previous home where they were at before, they were told to evacuate, so they assumed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=149.68s)]
*  that they were going to be safe. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=154.4s)]
*  So they went to a safe area, safe house, basically. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=155.88s)]
*  Coming from afar in Ohio, Mona is pleading not only for a ceasefire, but long-term action. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=159.16s)]
*  We can't just say, OK, we're going to stop bombing and then it's over. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=165.16s)]
*  You have to give them their dignity. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=168.52s)]
*  You have to give the Palestinians a place to call home. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=171.12s)]
*  In Minnesota, community members fill up an Islamic center praying in support of the Sakala [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=173.96s)]
*  family. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=180.08s)]
*  In the face of so much loss, their family has no time to properly mourn, overcome by [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=181.8s)]
*  constant worry for the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza caught in the crossfire. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=186.98s)]
*  There's a sense of helplessness. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=192.54s)]
*  The only thing we can do is pray. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v6k0bINc34&t=195.94s)]
