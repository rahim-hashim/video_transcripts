# 'Regional war has essentially begun' as US warns Iranian attack on Israel could be imminent
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc)
*  This statement that we got this morning is a bit of a shock because over the course of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=0.0s)]
*  the last 24 to 48 hours, U.S. officials were obviously concerned about what Iran might [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=5.36s)]
*  do as retaliation for obviously, you know, the major operations that Israel has been [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=13.56s)]
*  carrying out against Hezbollah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=20.44s)]
*  But we weren't hearing specifics surrounding it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  Now the fact that the senior White House official is saying that there is the expectation of [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=25.28s)]
*  an imminent ballistic missile threat against Israel by Iran, that's incredibly noteworthy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  That brings this to a different level than we have been feeling from U.S. officials, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=38.28s)]
*  frankly, over the last 24 or 48 hours or so. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  I think it's also noteworthy that in this statement from the senior White House official, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=48.08s)]
*  we hear them saying very clearly that if Iran does go through with this and carries [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=53.28s)]
*  out an attack against Israel, there will be severe consequences for Iran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=58.14s)]
*  There is a sense that perhaps a statement like this could deter Iran from going ahead [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=63.56s)]
*  with some planned operations, notably the fact that the senior White House official [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=69.4s)]
*  is also saying that the United States is working with Israel to shore up its defenses, as Nick [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=74.72s)]
*  was talking about when there was the last Iranian attack against Israel, a major attack [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=81.24s)]
*  back in April, the U.S. worked with its allies to really solidify and effectively defend [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  Israel. And so the U.S. is sending a clear message now that they are already engaged in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=95.8s)]
*  preparations of the like potentially in this situation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=101.64s)]
*  So there's a lot of questions that we'll be asking U.S. officials now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  Exactly what does that effort look like? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=109.4s)]
*  We heard this morning from the secretary of state. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=112.44s)]
*  He was here. This was before this statement came out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=115.56s)]
*  But he did say that the United States stands with Israel and Israel's defense, even though [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  overnight, of course, there was the ground operation, even though Israel is calling it [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=123.68s)]
*  a limited incursion into Lebanon that the U.S. had been warning against. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=129.28s)]
*  That has not shaken the resolve of Biden administration officials to even this morning, despite that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=134.56s)]
*  action by Israel to say that they continue to stand by Israel's defense. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=141.64s)]
*  That is likely informed by the fact that they are tracking this potentially imminent threat [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=146.72s)]
*  coming in from Iran right now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  So we're really working to learn more in terms of the magnitude of this potential threat [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=154.04s)]
*  from Iran. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=160.2s)]
*  And that is, of course, unclear at this point. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=162.2s)]
*  Kylie, thank you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=165.2s)]
*  We'll let Kylie go and work her sources. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=167.2s)]
*  Ben Wideman is with us from Beirut. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=169.2s)]
*  I'm right in the center of things that we have been reporting on, of course, over the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=172.2s)]
*  past week or so, very specifically today with further airstrikes on Beirut and around [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=177.2s)]
*  south and east of Lebanon and the ground incursion, temporary and limited, according to Israel, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=184.2s)]
*  that has started in southern Lebanon, about 200 kilometers up the coastline from where [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=190.2s)]
*  I am here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=196.2s)]
*  Ben, there will be those in this region who will suggest that this news today that we [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=197.2s)]
*  are hearing about an imminent attack by Iran on Israel with ballistic missiles is exactly [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=204.2s)]
*  where Benjamin Netanyahu wants to land. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=213.2s)]
*  There will be those, his critics, who say this is the ultimate war in what his critics [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=215.2s)]
*  say is his goal of forever wars. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=221.2s)]
*  Your thoughts at this point? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=224.2s)]
*  Well, certainly we are seeing Israel, Becky, on a roll. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=226.2s)]
*  They have severely crippled Hezbollah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=230.2s)]
*  They have demolished Gaza and did not crush Hamas, but certainly crippled them as well. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=234.2s)]
*  And perhaps he is looking elsewhere. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=240.2s)]
*  Keep in mind within the last 48 hours, in addition to military operations in Gaza and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=242.2s)]
*  Lebanon, Israel apparently has also struck Syria and Yemen. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=249.2s)]
*  And certainly we heard an address in English from Benjamin Netanyahu to the Iranian people [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=253.2s)]
*  who certainly suggested that he was not just sending a message, but he was sort of, if [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=261.2s)]
*  you read between the lines, he seemed to have something up his sleeve. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=268.2s)]
*  And so, yes, this may be his moment as the United States is essentially paralyzed by [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=273.2s)]
*  this chaotic electoral campaign, as U.S. diplomacy or even Middle East policy in general seems [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=279.2s)]
*  to be utterly adrift. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=288.2s)]
*  Keep in mind that the war in Gaza began almost a year ago, and in that time the United States [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=290.2s)]
*  has shuttled its diplomats around the region, but has accomplished nothing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=297.2s)]
*  The regional war that so many feared has in a sense begun. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=302.2s)]
*  There's a war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=308.2s)]
*  There's a war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=311.2s)]
*  Is Iran about to launch ballistic missiles on Israel? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=315.2s)]
*  This is a regional war. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=321.2s)]
*  This situation is increasingly dangerous and out of control, and there's nobody at the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=323.2s)]
*  wheel in the White House. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=329.2s)]
*  They come out with these statements suggesting they won't be happy with an Israeli land [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=331.2s)]
*  incursion, but then we see the news that Lloyd Austin, the U.S. defense secretary, has been [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=336.2s)]
*  on the phone several times with Yoav Galant, his Israeli counterpart, essentially reiterating [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=342.2s)]
*  the same thing, that the United States is committed to Israel's defense and its right [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=349.2s)]
*  to self-defense, but what we're seeing on reality, on the ground, is that the threat [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=355.2s)]
*  of regional war grows ever closer. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=361.2s)]
*  I already said there's a regional war, but an even broader regional war involving now [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=365.2s)]
*  perhaps Iran and others. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=370.2s)]
*  So it's a very dangerous point we're at, and as I said, there's no one at the wheel in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=372.2s)]
*  the United States, in the White House and the State Department, the one superpower that [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=378.2s)]
*  has the influence to actually change the course of events. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=383.2s)]
*  Well, as you've been speaking and providing what is, as ever, extremely important analysis, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=388.2s)]
*  we are just getting further word, further detail from the U.S., and it is the following [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=395.2s)]
*  then, that the U.S. believes that the imminent attack on Israel by Iran that we were just [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=401.2s)]
*  reporting on earlier could be similar in scope and scale to the response that it launched [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=409.2s)]
*  back in April. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=415.2s)]
*  Now, let's provide some context for that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=416.2s)]
*  At that time, that was a response to the targeted assassination of those at its consulate in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=419.2s)]
*  Damascus. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=426.2s)]
*  Israel never acknowledged that they were behind that targeted attack on Iran's assets in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=428.2s)]
*  Syria, but it is assumed to have been an Israeli strike. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=438.2s)]
*  So let's go back, and if the U.S. believes that it could be similar in scope and scale, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=442.2s)]
*  we were talking about some 350 missiles or so at the time, if I remember correctly, back [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=448.2s)]
*  in April, launched on Israel, causing ultimately no real impact. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=455.2s)]
*  Very few of those targets, those missiles actually reached their targets. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=465.2s)]
*  And what was very important back at the time, it was clear, that attack by Iran was telegraphed [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=472.2s)]
*  around this region and beyond, and it was very clear that Tehran had given a heads-up [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=478.2s)]
*  to everybody that this would happen. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=486.2s)]
*  It was about 72 hours, as I understand it, that sort of telegraphed window. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=489.2s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether, you know, it is 72 hours this time before we see a strike, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=494.2s)]
*  but I wonder if you want to just add any sort of perspective, given that extra information [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=500.2s)]
*  that we've just received. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=505.2s)]
*  Similar, expected to be similar in size and scope as the response from Tehran back in April. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=507.2s)]
*  Well, back in April, you'll recall, after that attempted Iranian strike on Israel, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=517.2s)]
*  the United States restrained, told Israel not to respond in a massive way to avoid things [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=523.2s)]
*  going out of control. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=532.2s)]
*  And I don't recall precisely what the Israelis hit, but it appeared to be something [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=534.2s)]
*  of no significance whatsoever. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=539.2s)]
*  So at the time in April, the danger of sort of this war broadening to involve Iran and Israel [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=541.2s)]
*  on an ongoing basis was averted. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=549.2s)]
*  The question is now, with, as I said, the United States, its diplomacy is basically in neutral [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=552.2s)]
*  and the White House seems to be empty. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=560.2s)]
*  Is the United States going to be able to, or willing to be able to exercise the kind of pressure [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=563.2s)]
*  it did back in April to stop the Israelis from massively retaliating for those Iranian strikes? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=570.2s)]
*  That's the question, and certainly what we've seen, particularly in regards to Lebanon [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=577.2s)]
*  over the last two weeks, where the Biden administration came out with this proposal, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=584.2s)]
*  this peaceful ceasefire proposal that they'd crafted with France that we're told the Israelis [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=589.2s)]
*  actually signed on to. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=594.2s)]
*  But then we heard Benjamin Netanyahu at the UN United Nations General Assembly during his speech [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=596.2s)]
*  not once mentioning a ceasefire and within the hour apparently authorizing the strike that killed [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=603.2s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, which only made the situation here in Lebanon even more volatile. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=611.2s)]
*  We've seen a lot of violence since then. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=618.2s)]
*  We've seen a week or now seven days of Israeli strikes and now overnight these limited raids, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=619.2s)]
*  as the Israelis call them. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=626.2s)]
*  So the situation has clearly indicated the last few months is that the United States is just [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=628.2s)]
*  absolutely timid when it comes to pressuring its key ally in the Middle East that it provides all [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=635.2s)]
*  the weapons it needs to conduct all of these military operations. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=643.2s)]
*  It just doesn't seem willing to put its foot on the, the U.S. foot on the brake and bring this [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=647.2s)]
*  situation at least to a temporary pause. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=654.2s)]
*  It just isn't happening. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yM9rqJEKmc&t=658.2s)]
