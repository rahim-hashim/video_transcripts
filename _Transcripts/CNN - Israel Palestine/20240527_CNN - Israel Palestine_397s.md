# At least 45 dead as Israel strikes Rafah, Gazan officials say
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g)
*  Israel has struck a displacement camp where civilians were sheltering, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=0.0s)]
*  killing at least 45 people in Raffa in southern Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=4.48s)]
*  That is according to the Gaza Health Ministry. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=8.24s)]
*  We must warn you that you are about to see in this segment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=10.72s)]
*  It's going to be very difficult to watch. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=14.96s)]
*  Well, these are the scenes overnight of the camp in Raffa set ablaze. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=30.56s)]
*  The Israeli military claim two Siena Hamas officials were killed in the strike [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=34.88s)]
*  with what they called precise munitions. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=40.16s)]
*  Local officials say most of the casualties were women and children. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=42.8s)]
*  Now you can see the location of the camp on this map. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=47.44s)]
*  Now it's a reminder that over a million people have been sheltering in Raffa [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=51.04s)]
*  as the war forced people further south. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=56.08s)]
*  Though many have fled yet again as Israel ramps up the operations in that area. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=58.72s)]
*  The strike came just two days after the International Court of Justice [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=63.92s)]
*  ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Raffa. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=67.84s)]
*  On Sunday, Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=70.64s)]
*  the first attack of its kind into Israel since January. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=73.84s)]
*  We've got CNN's Nada Bashir following developments for us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=77.36s)]
*  He's standing by in London. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=80.48s)]
*  Nada, distressing video out of Raffa. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=81.92s)]
*  A lot of that video we actually cannot share because it is so disturbing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=84.96s)]
*  Help us understand the impact of the strike. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=89.28s)]
*  Well, as you mentioned, many of those who were sheltering in this [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=93.2s)]
*  Tel El Sultan neighborhood in Raffa have been displaced time and time again. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=97.44s)]
*  They have been pushed south into the southern city of Raffa [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=102.24s)]
*  by the Israeli military told that this would be a safe zone. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=106.0s)]
*  And in fact, over the last month, we have been hearing warnings from the IDF [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=109.92s)]
*  telling civilians now to evacuate parts of Raffa to Gaza's coastal area [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=113.6s)]
*  for their safety and protection ahead of a looming full scale ground operation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=118.64s)]
*  This was not one of those areas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  This was not an area that received an evacuation order. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=126.16s)]
*  This was supposed to be a safe zone for civilians. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=128.48s)]
*  Clearly, that is not the case. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=131.76s)]
*  We've seen this incident overnight. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=133.44s)]
*  Air strikes targeting an area that is densely populated by civilians, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  filled with tents, makeshift tents sheltering civilians. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=139.76s)]
*  And we have seen graphic, disturbing, horrifying video [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=142.64s)]
*  emerging from the scene last night. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=146.48s)]
*  Tents completely engulfed in flames, charred bodies being pulled from the burning shelters, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  including the bodies of children. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=155.44s)]
*  Now, as we've heard from the health authorities in Gaza, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=157.44s)]
*  the majority of those casualties were women and children. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  More than 240 people have so far said to have been badly wounded and injured. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  We've heard from health authorities saying they simply do not have the capacity [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  in the remaining hospitals in the Raffa area to care for that number of casualties. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=172.8s)]
*  This is an overall disastrous situation for many of those civilians [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=178.32s)]
*  in the southern city of Raffa. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=183.76s)]
*  Huge amount of concern. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=185.84s)]
*  Of course, we've been hearing widespread condemnation [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=187.12s)]
*  and warnings against further military action in Raffa. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=189.6s)]
*  Clearly, those warnings have not been heeded. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=192.32s)]
*  And you know, what is, of course, getting a lot of attention as well [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=197.6s)]
*  is this just a few days after the ICJ ruling for Israel to halt operations in Raffa. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=201.52s)]
*  We have seen some reaction, firstly, to whether Israel is going to be adhering to that ruling [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  and, of course, the criticism of the way that Israel is conducting this operation in Raffa. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=214.56s)]
*  What more do we know? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=219.52s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  We've been hearing fierce criticism, of course, from European leaders. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=221.84s)]
*  We heard earlier this morning from the EU's Foreign Affairs Chief, Yossi Borrell, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=225.36s)]
*  saying that Israel must adhere to the ICJ ruling, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=229.52s)]
*  that it must immediately halt military operations in Raffa. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  We've heard from the German Foreign Minister saying earlier today [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  that the International Court of Justice order for Israel to halt its military operation [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=240.24s)]
*  in the southern Gaza city of Raffa is binding and has to be followed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, President Macron of France has also issued a statement. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=249.28s)]
*  He said that he was outraged by last night's attack on Raffa, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=253.28s)]
*  that these operations must stop. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=257.2s)]
*  There are no safe areas in the Raffa for Palestinian civilians. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=258.96s)]
*  I call for full respect for international law and for an immediate ceasefire. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  And, of course, there is a huge amount of concern [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=267.84s)]
*  around the potential for further military action in Raffa. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=269.84s)]
*  We've heard previously from one of Israel's closest allies, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=273.12s)]
*  the Biden administration, President Biden himself speaking to CNN, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=275.44s)]
*  saying that if Israel were to fully go into Raffa, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=278.88s)]
*  then the US would not be able to support in the form of arms and weapons, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=282.32s)]
*  that that would not be the case. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=286.64s)]
*  It remains to be seen whether this latest incident [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  is in fact a red line for President Biden. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  This has certainly drawn outrage amongst many in the international community, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  particularly, of course, from the United Nations, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  which has repeatedly warned against a full operation in Raffa [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  and continued airstrikes in Raffa. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=302.56s)]
*  This is an area that is densely populated still with civilians, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  the vast majority internally displaced. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=308.96s)]
*  And, of course, there is simply nowhere safe left for civilians to turn. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=311.84s)]
*  And, of course, there are questions around how this will impact [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=316.0s)]
*  ongoing ceasefire negotiations. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=318.16s)]
*  That is another point of concern we heard today from Qatari officials [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=320.0s)]
*  saying that they are worried that this could hinder those ongoing discussions [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=323.28s)]
*  around a potential truce between Israel and Hamas. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=326.64s)]
*  Eleni. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=329.12s)]
*  Nada Bashir, thank you so much for that update. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=332.24s)]
*  Well, the Palestinian Authority is calling on the United States [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=334.88s)]
*  to put more pressure on Israel to stop the violence [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=338.4s)]
*  and said the U.S. bears responsibility for these crimes that shame humanity. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=341.68s)]
*  We have not heard from the Biden administration yet [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=347.12s)]
*  regarding the attack on the refugee camp. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=350.24s)]
*  But just a few weeks ago, the U.S. president seemed to put forward a red line [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=352.48s)]
*  when it came to targeting civilians in Raffa. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=357.36s)]
*  They're going to Raffa. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=361.44s)]
*  I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Raffa, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  to deal with the cities, to deal with that problem. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=367.12s)]
*  We're going to continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of iron dome [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=370.16s)]
*  and their ability to respond to attacks like came out of the Middle East recently. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=375.12s)]
*  But it's just wrong. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=382.32000000000005s)]
*  We're not going to supply the weapons and the artillery shells used. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=384.72s)]
*  Well, we are closely following the response from the Americans, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  and we will bring it to you when we get it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsnvUjPrC3g&t=394.40000000000003s)]
