# Israeli military accidentally shoots and kills 3 Israelis held hostage in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA)
*  The IDF saying that it mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, an IDF spokesman says the victims were misidentified as a threat and shot dead. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=4.4s)]
*  CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Sturrode, Israel with more on this tragic development. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=10.0s)]
*  Jeremy, what more is the IDF saying about this? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=14.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's very sad news and the Israeli military is admitting that soldiers effectively mistakenly [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=20.64s)]
*  identified these three Israeli hostages as a threat and shot and killed them during combat [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=26.4s)]
*  operations being conducted in Shizhaiya, which has been the scene of very heavy fighting between [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=32.32s)]
*  Israel and Hamas over the course of the last week. Two of the three hostages have been identified. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=37.6s)]
*  One of the families of the hostage of one of the deceased hostages asked that their name not be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  broadcast but the two who we can tell you are Yotam Chaim who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=49.44s)]
*  Aza on October 7th and the second is Samer Talalka who was kidnapped from Kibbutz near Am also on [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=54.32s)]
*  October 7th. The Israeli military effectively recovered these bodies in Gaza, moved them to [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=61.28s)]
*  Israel where they were taken to a forensic center and then subsequently positively identified as [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=69.2s)]
*  the bodies of three hostages who have been who were kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. Now we [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=75.84s)]
*  should note amid all of this that this comes as the Israeli military had loosened its rules of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=82.0s)]
*  engagement as it began this war in Gaza following those October 7th attacks allowing Israeli soldiers [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=87.36s)]
*  to fire upon suspected terrorists with while conducting fewer checks than they normally [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=94.56s)]
*  would have. The Israeli military we're told is taking lessons from this incident and transmitting [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  them to soldiers in the field. They also say that they quote expressed their deep remorse over the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  tragic incident and send the families their heartfelt condolences. This also comes as we [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=110.8s)]
*  know that some of those former hostages who were freed as part of that week-long truce between [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=116.16s)]
*  Israel and Hamas they angrily confronted the Israeli prime minister last week with one of those [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=120.56s)]
*  former hostages accusing the Israeli government of having no information and no intelligence about [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=125.28s)]
*  the whereabouts of these hostages noting that the location where she was being kept by Hamas was [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=130.88s)]
*  actually shelled by the Israeli military and today we are learning of a far more tragic and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=137.2s)]
*  direct incident where Israeli forces appear to have fired upon Israeli hostages in Gaza believing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=142.48s)]
*  that they were a threat and then ultimately realizing later after the fact that they were [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  indeed hostages. Boris, Sam? Jeremy you mentioned the the loosened rules of engagement obviously [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan is in the Middle East right now he's expressed the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  Biden administration's concern about the intensity of the IDF offensive of course President Biden's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=163.44s)]
*  desire for Israel to tone it down how do you think this news is going to play into the tone of these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=169.84s)]
*  talks? Well we'll have to wait and see I mean hostage negotiations are one of the key elements [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=176.88s)]
*  of Jake Sullivan's visit and meetings with Israeli officials but as you noted one of the other focuses [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=186.96s)]
*  is indeed the civilian casualty count I mean we have watched as now nearly 19 000 Palestinians have [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=192.64s)]
*  been killed in Gaza some of those combatants many of those non-combatants including over 7 000 [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=198.48s)]
*  children who are believed to be among those who have been killed in Gaza according to the Palestinian [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=205.2s)]
*  Ministry of Health and Jake Sullivan said earlier today that he believes Israel intends to distinguish [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=210.0s)]
*  between Hamas targets and civilians but that that intention does not always line up with the reality [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=215.92s)]
*  on the ground and that reality that mismatch has really up until now mostly applied to Palestinian [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=221.84s)]
*  civilians but in this case it appears to also be matching up to a reality that has now affected [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=228.72s)]
*  and resulted in the loss of life of three Israeli civilians who were held hostage by Hamas and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=235.12s)]
*  unfortunately today killed by Israeli forces. All right Jeremy Diamond thank you so much. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=241.52s)]
*  And joining us now is IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrigas. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  Jonathan how did this happen what can you tell us? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=252.96s)]
*  Yes good evening tonight here in Israel a very sad and tragic event one that the IDF of course [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=259.52s)]
*  terribly regrets and has told that to the families we are investigating how it happened one of the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=267.04s)]
*  contributing factors are obviously related to the fact or can obviously be related to the fact that [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=274.08s)]
*  so far what we have encountered on the battlefield are many Hamas combatants that have been dressed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=280.24s)]
*  in civilian clothes and I'm quite sure that that has been part of the issue here but it's still [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=287.04s)]
*  very early to understand and to say certain things and what we can say and confirm is what we have [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=293.76s)]
*  issued officially a very sad event tragic event of course goes against everything that what we [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=301.04s)]
*  have been trying to do for the last two months more than two months it's day 70 of the fighting [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=307.04s)]
*  but even a sad event like this will not shake our resolve and it will not divert us from the focus [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=313.76s)]
*  which is clear to dismantle Hamas [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=320.48s)]
*  Sir you broke up there at the end but I'm curious because you mentioned that the IDF is still trying [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=328.24s)]
*  to get details on exactly what transpired in a statement from the IDF it says that immediate [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=334.56s)]
*  lessons from the event have been learned which have been passed on to all IDF troops in the field [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=340.16s)]
*  can you share what those lessons were if there's going to be a different approach by the IDF now [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=345.68s)]
*  we're looking into how it happened how it came about that these hostages were out [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=355.36s)]
*  and trying to understand how that happened whether it was intentional or by Hamas or whether it [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=363.52s)]
*  wasn't intentional and what we have told our troops is to exercise a deal called when being [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=369.6s)]
*  confronted with people in civilian clothes again part of the complexity here is that we're fighting [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=377.68s)]
*  in a civilian environment where almost all of the RPG crews and the crews that are attacking our [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=384.8s)]
*  tanks and our troops have been dressed in civilian clothes so it creates a very dynamic and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=393.92s)]
*  challenging combat environment and what we have told our troops is to be extra vigilant and do [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=401.44s)]
*  one more safety check before dealing with kinetics with any threat that they face on the battlefield [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=408.32s)]
*  but it is a very challenging environment that our troops are in just to follow up on what you said [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=415.92s)]
*  you said these hostages were out can you just expand on that a little bit what do you mean [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=421.52s)]
*  by that just the circumstances around this and as we just heard our Jeremy Diamond talk about the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=426.08s)]
*  fact that the rules of engagement have been loosened since the October 7th attack do you [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  think that could have played a role in the killings of these three Israeli hostages [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  yes I don't know what Jeremy base is that on and I am not aware of any different rules of engagement [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=441.36s)]
*  our rules of engagement are those of a military at war against a terrorist organization that uses [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=448.96000000000004s)]
*  civilian infrastructure uses schools and hospitals and mosques and ambulances and all the things that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=455.36s)]
*  we have seen and you have reported on during the last two months and so I'm not aware that we have [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=461.2s)]
*  changed any of our rules of engagement there according to the laws of conflict and according [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=467.04s)]
*  to our standard practice in war and we will have to look into and analyze exactly what happened and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=471.12s)]
*  what I can say so far is that these the three Israelis former hostages they were above ground [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=477.92s)]
*  in Syria in close proximity to one of our units in the area and then when we look at the military [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=485.92s)]
*  area and then were misidentified as posing a threat and therefore Israeli troops fired and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=494.48s)]
*  unfortunately killed them [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_TG4x1SplA&t=504.08000000000004s)]
