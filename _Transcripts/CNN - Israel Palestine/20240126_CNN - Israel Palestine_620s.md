# Top UN court orders Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc)
*  The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Commission of Genocidal Act in Gaza and to punish any public incitement of genocide. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=5.16s)]
*  That provisional ruling announced at The Hague a short time ago, with the court concluding [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=12.26s)]
*  that it has jurisdiction over the case brought by South Africa alleging Israel's actions [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=18.28s)]
*  in Gaza could amount to genocide. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=23.28s)]
*  The court stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=25.82s)]
*  It did order, however, Israel to submit a report within one month on what it is doing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  to respond to the court's order. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=36.66s)]
*  A. Killing groups and members of the group. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=55.82s)]
*  B. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=59.06s)]
*  Well these provisional measures come as the Hamas-Turan Health Ministry in Gaza reports [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=65.98s)]
*  the death toll in Gaza since the start of the war has now passed 26,000 with 64,000 [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=70.9s)]
*  people injured. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=78.98s)]
*  It says at least 183 were killed over the past day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=80.4s)]
*  There is a lot to unpack here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=85.06s)]
*  We've got Melissa Bell connecting us from The Hague. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=86.5s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv as well as David McKenzie in Johannesburg all standing [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=89.38s)]
*  by for analysis. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=94.32s)]
*  Melissa, let's start off with you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=95.32s)]
*  We've just heard from the ICJ that, of course, ruling that just came through. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=97.86s)]
*  Immediate measures, it says, that Israel must adhere to. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Take us through what you've heard. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=108.4s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=109.86s)]
*  Maybe you can hear behind me, Eleni, some of the pro-Palestinian protesters listening [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=110.86s)]
*  on a big screen who have been cheering on as every one of those counts of the ruling [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=116.04s)]
*  came from the head of the International Court of Justice here in The Hague. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  It was just short of a ceasefire, of course, that the ruling went and yet significantly [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=126.84s)]
*  further towards it than any of us had imagined when these proceedings began. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  We listened on the 10th and 11th of January, Eleni, to South Africa, and then Israel lay [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=137.12s)]
*  out their case. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  And what we just heard today was the head of the ICJ essentially go extremely far in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  the direction of South Africa, conceding that it was plausible, the Genocidal Acts were [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=151.48s)]
*  being committed, urging Israel to take immediate measures to ensure that there are no further [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=156.98s)]
*  killings of Palestinians in Gaza, a group, by the way, that the court recognizes as a [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=164.5s)]
*  protected people, nor the further causing of any mental or bodily harm to them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=169.78s)]
*  Now, that is short of a ceasefire, but very close to it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=175.57999999999998s)]
*  And I think this is a ruling that Israel is now going to have to respond to. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=179.7s)]
*  It had been said the fact that it were chosen to represent themselves as robustly as they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=184.38s)]
*  did, an indication of how seriously they took this court and its rulings. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=188.4s)]
*  No doubt what the wider world will consider as it takes in these proceedings. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  So an order that I think will now see a great deal of pressure on Israel, certainly to allow [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=199.02s)]
*  more access to Gaza and probably, Eleni, to alter the way in which it is perhaps going [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=207.58s)]
*  about its military operation or certainly the transparency with which it's going about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=215.58s)]
*  the weight of this, the UN's highest court, such that it will be a very difficult ruling [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=220.82s)]
*  for Israel to ignore. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=226.7s)]
*  Melissa Bau there for us at The Hague and we can see those protesters as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=231.22s)]
*  We've also got Jeremy Diamond standing by in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=236.78s)]
*  And in fact, we've just heard from Netanyahu, from Benjamin Netanyahu, hailing the ICJ ruling [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=239.82s)]
*  as what he says, a rejection of discrimination against Israel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=246.54000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the Israeli prime minister in his comments, making clear that Israel's commitment to international [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  law in his words is unwavering and also making clear that Israel is not going to stop its [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=259.38s)]
*  war in Gaza, talking about the fact that Israel will continue to defend itself against Hamas, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  which he calls a genocidal terror organization. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=270.06s)]
*  But what he is also distinguishing in this video message is that the war in Gaza is against [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=273.66s)]
*  Hamas and not against Palestinian civilians. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=278.62s)]
*  And he is also making note of the fact that Israel will, quote, continue to facilitate [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians and continue its efforts to minimize harm [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=286.3s)]
*  to Palestinian civilians as it continues its military operations in Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=292.58s)]
*  We're getting some far stronger reaction, perhaps, from Israel's defense minister, who [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=297.38000000000005s)]
*  is making clear that those who seek justice, he says, will not find it in the leather chairs [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=303.82000000000005s)]
*  of the court chambers in The Hague, slamming The Hague's decision not to reject South Africa's [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  petition outright to allow this case to proceed. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=315.78000000000003s)]
*  I think now one of the real questions is to what extent is Israel going to actually abide [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=319.26000000000005s)]
*  by the terms of this provisional reading, ruling, and to what extent will they actually [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=323.82s)]
*  compile this report that the court has demanded of Israel within the next month? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=328.82s)]
*  I think it's clear that Israel has decided to kind of play along with this court up until [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=335.61999999999995s)]
*  now has chosen to defend itself quite arduously in these proceedings. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  But now, as it relates to specific actions on the ground, to what extent will Israel [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=347.44s)]
*  actually move forward with those? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=352.54s)]
*  To another extent, it's important to note that this ruling obviously didn't go as far [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=355.54s)]
*  as South Africa wanted, as far as Israel feared it would in terms of calling for an outright [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=360.54s)]
*  ceasefire in this war. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=366.02s)]
*  That has not happened here. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=367.3s)]
*  And because of that, there's certainly a significant sigh of relief among senior Israeli [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=368.86s)]
*  officials as they look at this ruling, even though this court very much laid out the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=373.98s)]
*  disastrous humanitarian conditions in Gaza, gave some credence to the claims of South [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=380.58s)]
*  Africa while it made clear that it wasn't ruling on the merits of the case. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=387.62s)]
*  It certainly can continue to soil Israel's international reputation, but it doesn't go [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=391.21999999999997s)]
*  as far as calling for an outright cessation of hostilities, which could have potentially [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=397.46s)]
*  put Israel in the position of defying a binding ruling by this court. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=401.78s)]
*  All right, we've got David McKenzie in Johannesburg as well. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=407.1s)]
*  And David, we also heard from the Minister of International Relations, Naledi Pandor, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=411.74s)]
*  outside the courts today. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=416.58000000000004s)]
*  And to Jeremy's point, yes, the, you know, the wording in terms of the ceasing of the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=418.94s)]
*  military action right now wasn't in this ruling by the ICJ. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=429.06s)]
*  But what Naledi Pandor interestingly said, that if Israel is going to abide by what was [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=436.3s)]
*  put out in court today, that a cessation would have to occur. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=441.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think what's important here to note is that, Eleni, this is a matter that isn't [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=448.74s)]
*  over. As Jeremy mentioned, Israel is required to give a report in about a month about how [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=453.38s)]
*  is going towards meeting those requests, those binding requests of the court to avoid what [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=459.86s)]
*  the court says may at some point amount to genocide as it does its investigation into [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=468.3s)]
*  the horrible circumstances in Gaza. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  So, from the South African perspective, they will be hoping for the pressure to be piled [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=476.94s)]
*  on to try and improve the conditions of the people in Gaza. It was very telling that when [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=481.41999999999996s)]
*  someone asked Naledi Pandor, the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=486.98s)]
*  on the steps of the court, you know, what does this say about South Africa and Israel, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=492.06s)]
*  she said, well, this is about the Palestinian people. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=495.94s)]
*  And as you know, Eleni, the ruling party here has had a long affinity to the Palestinian [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=498.70000000000005s)]
*  cause all the way back to and before Nelson Mandela. This is a consistent policy stance [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=503.90000000000003s)]
*  by the South African government. And they put the money where their mouth is, as it [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=509.94s)]
*  was. She said they couldn't stand idly by while these alleged atrocities happened, and [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=514.0600000000001s)]
*  now they are going to continue this case in the months and potentially years ahead. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=519.58s)]
*  I think an important thing to note as well is South Africa says that it wants to pursue [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=525.34s)]
*  this case also to try and make a statement about bodies like the UN Security Council [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=530.1800000000001s)]
*  not being effective in trying to push global cooperation. They said this venue may be a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=536.14s)]
*  way to do it. Take a listen. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=543.38s)]
*  The member states of the United Nations must oversee the process and ensure that we create [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=547.6999999999999s)]
*  a basis for a global community in which a resort to arms is no longer easy, a resort [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=554.6999999999999s)]
*  to abuse is no longer easy, and that more effort is now directed toward negotiation [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=563.42s)]
*  and toward seeking peaceful means of ending conflict. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=570.54s)]
*  She did allude to powerful friends of Israel, and you can read the U.S. in that, to perhaps [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=576.9799999999999s)]
*  persuade Israel behind the scenes to change how they are pursuing this war against Hamas [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=583.06s)]
*  in the coming weeks to avoid possible censure in the coming months from this court. Of course, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=589.9s)]
*  Israel has repeatedly denied that it is doing anything in the theater of war. In fact, they [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=594.9s)]
*  have said that they have tried to protect civilians and provide humanitarian aid. It [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=601.3s)]
*  will be really important to see whether the behavior of Israel or the sense of how they [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=606.38s)]
*  are working towards these judgments or at least rulings by the court play out in the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=612.78s)]
*  coming days. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yetveeYbHXc&t=618.02s)]
