# Why this expert thinks everyone's mental health is 'at risk' from Israel-Hamas war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM)
*  for people who are just watching the images out of Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=0.0s)]
*  It's incredibly disturbing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=5.2s)]
*  The war shows no sign of ending anytime soon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=6.98s)]
*  As a result, it is taking a toll on people's mental health around the world. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=10.4s)]
*  Joining us now is psychiatrist and host of the How Can I Help podcast, Dr. Gail Saltz. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=15.76s)]
*  Doctor, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=20.84s)]
*  You know, even if you don't have family members or people you know who are impacted by what's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=23.62s)]
*  happening in Israel, I think people are just shocked at the level of carnage. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=29.84s)]
*  How would you advise a general public in terms of how much they should be consuming and when [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=39.12s)]
*  they should know when to take a break? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I think you have to know yourself. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=50.72s)]
*  So for people who know, they tend to be anxious, they tend to struggle with mood, they have [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=52.54s)]
*  a history of trauma of some sort, any really any sort or history of problems in terms of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=58.0s)]
*  mental health. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=64.44s)]
*  They're more at risk. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=65.88s)]
*  People, as you pointed out, who are connected to this in any sort of way, they're more at [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=66.88s)]
*  risk. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=71.48s)]
*  But I would say to you that actually all of us are somewhat at risk because we have never [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=72.48s)]
*  had this level of graphic image coming to us on such a constant basis. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=77.4s)]
*  So it's not only on the news, it's on everybody's social media feeds. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=83.8s)]
*  And today, children, adolescents, adults, we're receiving these images and images tend [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=87.96s)]
*  to stick in your mind in a very intrusive way, making it difficult to concentrate, feeling [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=94.12s)]
*  like it's repeating all the time, making it difficult to sleep. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=100.16s)]
*  And those things will further impact your mental health. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=104.2s)]
*  say a little bit to all of us, we have to really limit how much we are seeing and possibly [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=108.16s)]
*  even take a break and take your news in via reading it or listening to it, but picking [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=114.96s)]
*  a source and limiting how much of the day you actually expose yourself. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  So maybe like 30 minutes and not doing it close to bedtime, where you're likely to be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=126.82s)]
*  even more stirred up and therefore have difficulty sleeping. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=132.5s)]
*  There's a point at which we have to turn it off. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=136.28s)]
*  And then there's a point at which for some people, they need some help. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=140.72s)]
*  How do you know when you've gotten to that second level, that second degree there where [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=145.2s)]
*  you need to talk to a professional about what you're watching and what you're experiencing? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=150.68s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, most a lot of people can do things for themselves before [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=156.0s)]
*  they get there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=161.28s)]
*  They can add some coping tools that help with anxiety during the day, deep breathing, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=162.28s)]
*  aerobic exercise, talking to people around them that make them feel better. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=168.08s)]
*  Stay away from doomsday people, cat catastrophizing people that will make you actually [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=173.6s)]
*  feel worse. But talking to people can also really be helpful. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=178.88s)]
*  But beyond that, if your anxiety and concern about this are disturbing you such that you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=182.48s)]
*  can't concentrate at work. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=188.48s)]
*  You can't get things done the way you normally would. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=190.28s)]
*  You can't sleep well at night. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  It's affecting your relationships. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=195.2s)]
*  Basically, if it's intruding into and affecting your day for more than a few days, this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=196.88s)]
*  might be the time that you want to say, hey, I need to get an evaluation, something a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  process may have started here that I have to really look into and think about whether I [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=206.64s)]
*  need a little extra help with. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  I can't stop thinking about, you know, so many of the people that we and our CNN [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=213.84s)]
*  colleagues have interviewed there out in this war zone, the family members who have seen [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=219.28s)]
*  the horror happen before their eyes, people losing their children, people being on the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=224.8s)]
*  phone while the abduction and the screaming was happening in the background. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=230.12s)]
*  How do we begin to help them recover from the trauma? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  So obviously, the closer that you are, as I said to this event, the more likely you are [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=240.72s)]
*  to have what's called an acute stress reaction, which is a whole collection of symptoms of [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=246.12s)]
*  the intrusive thoughts of the event, repetitively of feeling like you have to avoid anything [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=250.76s)]
*  that reminds you of the event of trouble sleeping and concentrating and taking pleasure in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=255.92s)]
*  anything and trouble with your appetite. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=260.12s)]
*  But again, the closer you are to this, the more likely you are to go on and develop post [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=262.24s)]
*  traumatic stress disorder. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=267.28s)]
*  So what's important is to intervene early and intervention means, again, any kind of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=270.52s)]
*  thing that would help you decrease your overall anxiety level. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=278.55999999999995s)]
*  So there are lots of, as I alluded to earlier, exercises one can do that do take down your [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=282.28s)]
*  anxiety level, which helps you manage trauma more. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  You want to pay attention to your mood. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=292.28s)]
*  So actually spending time talking about anything positive, anything positive. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=294.44s)]
*  And in fact, we hear or someone anywhere and they too can think about what can they do [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=300.56s)]
*  to help their situation, because helping and being involved in something that feels like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  an active action really does help with managing the trauma of this. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=311.84s)]
*  So those sorts of things are going to be very important to to the people who are involved. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=317.32s)]
*  And of course, you know, people like myself, we're getting involved in mental health care [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=322.96s)]
*  for those people as well. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=327.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, Dr. Gail Saltz, some great advice there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlQiCdqFURM&t=332.08s)]
