# Hezbollah leader issues 'surprising warning' as tensions with Israel ramp up
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU)
*  Hassan Nasrallah saying no place in Israel would be safe in the event of all-out war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=0.0s)]
*  If war is imposed on Lebanon, the resistance will fight without restraints, without rules [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  and without limits. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  The enemy knows very well that we have prepared ourselves for the worst and most difficult [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  days and the enemy knows very well what awaits it and that is why it was deterred for nine [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=18.76s)]
*  months. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=24.92s)]
*  His televised speech focused on what he says is the group's expanded military and intelligence [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=26.24s)]
*  capabilities. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=30.88s)]
*  This followed Hezbollah's release of that purported drone video showing Israeli military [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=31.88s)]
*  and civilian sites in northern Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=37.2s)]
*  Israel responding that Hezbollah would be destroyed in an all-out war. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=39.8s)]
*  Ben Wiedemann joining us from Beirut. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=45.04s)]
*  Nasrallah also had a pointed warning for the Republic of Cyprus. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=48.64s)]
*  Ben saying it would be targeted if it allows Israeli forces to use its military bases or [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=52.56s)]
*  airports. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=58.56s)]
*  Of course, Cyprus has held joint military drills with Israel several times over the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=59.56s)]
*  past decade. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=64.2s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=65.76s)]
*  This reference to Cyprus really came out of the blue. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  We monitor Hezbollah media channels very closely and there was no hint that this was coming [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=73.48s)]
*  but clearly they are concerned given the growing military ties between Israel and Cyprus [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=81.28s)]
*  that somehow Israel will use Cyprus's airports or bases as he said to launch attacks on Lebanon [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=87.6s)]
*  and particularly Hezbollah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=96.6s)]
*  So he issued this rather surprising warning against Cyprus. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=99.6s)]
*  Now the response of the Cypriots was that for instance the president yesterday came [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=105.16s)]
*  out and said this was not a pleasant remark coming from Nasrallah and that he insisted [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=110.58s)]
*  that Cyprus wants no part in any war or conflict as he said and we heard also from a spokesman [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=117.48s)]
*  from before the Cypriot government this morning saying that no that Cypriot territory would [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=125.94s)]
*  not be used in any military activity if it comes to a war. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=132.98s)]
*  But clearly Hezbollah is concerned not only about what could come from the south but also [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=140.06s)]
*  clearly what might come from the west as well. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=147.3s)]
*  Becky? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=150.86s)]
*  Ben, the Cypriot president as you rightly pointed out has responded very specifically [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=151.86s)]
*  he said what I have to respond to is that the Republic of Cyprus is in no way involved [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=159.16s)]
*  in the war conflicts. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=165.22s)]
*  The Republic of Cyprus is not part of the problem. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  He said the Republic of Cyprus is part of the solution and our role in this as demonstrated [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=169.5s)]
*  for example through the humanitarian corridor, he's talking there about the maritime corridor [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=175.98s)]
*  between Cyprus and Gaza is recognised not only by the Arab world but by the international [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=181.26s)]
*  community as a whole. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=187.34s)]
*  So I think it's important that we just explain for the viewers what role Cyprus has had over [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=192.1s)]
*  the course of this war and how they have been involved. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=197.66000000000003s)]
*  Well certainly they were a sort of a transit point for humanitarian goods headed to that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=205.3s)]
*  rather ill-fated or so far not very successful US peer that cost US taxpayers $340 million [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=213.74s)]
*  to bring in humanitarian goods to Gaza long and also that includes the participation of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=223.62s)]
*  1000 US service people as well. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=233.18s)]
*  Now Cyprus is in an interesting position. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=237.14000000000001s)]
*  I recall during the 70s and 80s it did not have very good relationship with Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=239.62s)]
*  In fact there was a case where the Cypriot authorities arrested several Israelis who [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=246.1s)]
*  they believed were involved in sabotage or attempts to assassinate Palestinian members [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  of the PLO at the time but as a result of the deterioration of Israeli Turkish relations [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=258.42s)]
*  going back to the 2010 Mavi Marmara incident where Israeli commanders boarded a Turkish [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=268.46s)]
*  ship that was headed to Gaza killing several people on board that ship those relations [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=277.14000000000004s)]
*  have deteriorated keeping in mind of course that Turkey essentially has controlled the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=283.1s)]
*  northern part of Cyprus since 1975. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=288.3s)]
*  So essentially the Cypriot government is looking at it as the enemy of our enemy is our friend. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=292.54s)]
*  All very complicated in a very Middle Eastern sort of way but that sort of puts Cyprus on [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=300.1s)]
*  the map in terms of where they stand at the moment regarding the tensions between Lebanon [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=306.34s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  Becky? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=315.26s)]
*  You're right to point out that this is a multi-layered conflict and of course Israel warning of the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=316.26s)]
*  prospect of all-out war after Hezbollah published purported drone footage of civilian and military [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=326.65999999999997s)]
*  installations in Israel. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=335.34s)]
*  Hezbollah of course have said that their efforts against Israel will continue as long as the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=338.53999999999996s)]
*  Israel Hamas war continues as long as the conflict in Gaza continues. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  Ben, thank you and that does continue. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=350.62s)]
*  The Rafah crossing between Israel and Egypt has been a vital point for aid into Gaza of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=353.02s)]
*  course now new video and satellite images reviewed by CNN show the passenger terminal [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=358.85999999999996s)]
*  on the Gaza side has been burned and severely damaged. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=364.74s)]
*  The Israeli military conducted significant bulldozing and clearing at the terminal earlier [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=367.66s)]
*  this month causing more destruction to a main building already damaged by fire in late May. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-_CMqXpHFU&t=372.46000000000004s)]
