# Woman recalls being told her sister was killed by Hamas at Nova Festival
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0)
*  We're learning much more now about the lives lost [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=0.0s)]
*  in those brutal Hamas attacks on Israel two weeks ago. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  Among them, 23-year-old Shira Ayalon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=5.94s)]
*  She and a friend were killed by Hamas terrorists [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=9.84s)]
*  at that Nova Music Festival. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=12.44s)]
*  Shira's sister, Adar Ayalon, joining us now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Adar, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=18.22s)]
*  I wish we were just talking under different circumstances. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=20.02s)]
*  And let me express our deepest condolences to you [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=22.92s)]
*  over your sister's death. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=26.12s)]
*  First of all, what can you tell us [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=27.72s)]
*  about what happened to her? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=29.02s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=32.8s)]
*  Two weeks ago, Shira and two of her friends [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=37.36s)]
*  went to the Nova Music Festival. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=40.5s)]
*  And it's Saturday morning at 7 a.m. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=45.28s)]
*  Shira called my dad, telling him there was bombing over there, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=49.58s)]
*  which sadly, it become a regular thing in here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=54.739999999999995s)]
*  She told him that she's scared and she's gonna wait [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=59.64s)]
*  for the panic to come and come home. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=62.94s)]
*  But 30 minutes after, she didn't answer her phone anymore. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  She was missing for five days. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=71.46s)]
*  And after five days, we got a message from the army [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=75.1s)]
*  that they recognize her body. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=78.34s)]
*  Her body lay down in the forest for five days. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=82.44s)]
*  Apparently, the terrorists surrounded the party. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  They've been planning that for a while apparently. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=93.78s)]
*  And they just came inside, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  started to automatically shoot everybody over there, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=99.18s)]
*  stealing the stuff from their bodies, kidnapping. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=104.62s)]
*  After they done over there, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=109.34s)]
*  they went to the nearest cities in Kibbutzim, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=112.22s)]
*  just broke into houses, killed families, babies, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=114.62s)]
*  kidnapped 200 people, killing thousands of people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=119.78s)]
*  And for these days, while she was missing, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=127.9s)]
*  I tried to find some information. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=133.1s)]
*  I watched the videos in Telegram, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=134.96s)]
*  apparently the Hamas videoed himself killing people, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=138.22s)]
*  then uploaded to Telegram and TikTok. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=142.74s)]
*  So sadly, I watched all the horrible things that they did. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=145.14s)]
*  And we were managed to look at her phone the first day. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=151.6s)]
*  We saw it in Gaza, so we thought they kidnapped her. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=156.02s)]
*  But apparently she was murdered. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=160.86s)]
*  They shoot her in the back at around 8 a.m. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=163.66s)]
*  I talked to a lot of her friend that was in the party [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=168.42s)]
*  while I was looking for her. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=171.98s)]
*  And the stories were the same. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=174.9s)]
*  They said that once the shooting was starting, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=177.22s)]
*  it was a complete chaos. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=179.22s)]
*  They hide in the forest for hours. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=182.14s)]
*  They describe it like they're running away from the Nazis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=184.78s)]
*  They tried to call for help from the army and the police, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=189.62s)]
*  but nobody came because there were hundreds of terrorists [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=193.14s)]
*  just shooting cars in the street, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=197.26s)]
*  so nobody can get over there to help them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=199.77999999999997s)]
*  And apparently there were so many dead bodies over there [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=204.98s)]
*  that it took them, they couldn't get the bodies [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=208.7s)]
*  to the hospital anymore [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=213.89999999999998s)]
*  because all of the hospitals were full. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  So they bring the bodies, they collect the bodies [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=216.89999999999998s)]
*  and bring them to the near army base. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=219.66s)]
*  This is why it took them six days to recognize her [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=222.66s)]
*  and bring her to bury her. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=226.9s)]
*  And she lay in the forest for six days [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=230.42s)]
*  before we buried her. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=235.82s)]
*  So sad. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=237.34s)]
*  Adar, tell us a little bit about your sister, Shira. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=238.18s)]
*  What was she like? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=241.26s)]
*  She just started her life. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=245.42s)]
*  She was 23. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=247.9s)]
*  She just came back from India. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=248.94s)]
*  She was very peaceful and kind. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=251.38s)]
*  She was about to start university, psychological degree. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=254.66s)]
*  And she was very gentle and very, very delicate [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=263.06s)]
*  and she had nothing to do with this war. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=266.14s)]
*  Like I can't even imagine what kind of monster [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=269.38s)]
*  can shoot kids, innocent kids, not soldiers, civilians, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=274.5s)]
*  innocent civilians that just came to party [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=280.14s)]
*  and to celebrate life. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=282.78s)]
*  And we're heartbroken. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=286.14s)]
*  Like we're devastated about it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=288.46s)]
*  She was so delicate and so peaceful [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=291.02s)]
*  and very nonviolent. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=294.22s)]
*  She had nothing to do. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=298.22s)]
*  I don't think that she could have survived this attack. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=300.06s)]
*  No way that she could have survived it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=306.06s)]
*  So, so awful. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=309.7s)]
*  The IDF, as you know, says more than 200 people [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=311.02s)]
*  are being held hostage in Gaza right now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=313.74s)]
*  I know your family tracked your sister's phone there [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=316.46s)]
*  thinking she was perhaps one of the hostages. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=319.34s)]
*  What was it like for your family [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=322.06s)]
*  during this awful, awful time? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=323.9s)]
*  My parents actually said that they prefer her to be dead [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=328.14s)]
*  than to get kidnapped because they know [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=334.26s)]
*  that the terrorists, they abused, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=338.26s)]
*  the people who got kidnapped, they abused the dead bodies. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=340.3s)]
*  They raped the women over there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=343.7s)]
*  So they were hoping for her to be dead on the spot. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  And yeah, they shot her from a zero range. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=351.65999999999997s)]
*  So she was dead on the spot apparently. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=354.53999999999996s)]
*  I had hope that maybe she got kidnapped [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  and maybe we can free those kids someday. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't know the last time that they kidnap a soldier, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=368.29999999999995s)]
*  it took us five years to find his location. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  But I have hope that at least we can free those 200 kids [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=374.97999999999996s)]
*  and elderly and babies [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=380.78s)]
*  because those people don't deserve this. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=382.5s)]
*  They're probably in a very bad situation [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=385.74s)]
*  like psychologically and health, very bad health situation. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=388.38s)]
*  I know that most of them been held [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=393.26000000000005s)]
*  after they already got shot. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=397.98s)]
*  So they're dying. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=399.5s)]
*  They're in, I saw some videos of the Hamas taking, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=402.18s)]
*  like while I was looking for her, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=406.66s)]
*  I watched hundreds of videos on the diagram [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=408.66s)]
*  and I seen the people that they took. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=412.22s)]
*  Some of them were babies infants, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=414.54s)]
*  some of them were very old people [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=416.34000000000003s)]
*  and most of them were very badly injured [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  with wounds on their legs and in their stomach. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=422.3s)]
*  So I really hope that we can free them [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=424.90000000000003s)]
*  as fast as we can because we have, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=430.38s)]
*  as a country we have responsibility for them. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=436.98s)]
*  We have responsibility for them to save them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=440.5s)]
*  Adara Ayelod, thank you very much [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=445.7s)]
*  for spending a few moments with us. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=447.74s)]
*  Our deepest deepest condolences to you [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=449.22s)]
*  and to your family and the loss of your loving sister. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=451.54s)]
*  And as we say, Zichruna libraha, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR_EAWjPUM0&t=454.74s)]
