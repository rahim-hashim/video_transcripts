# Hamas will pay â€˜the way the Nazis paid in Europe,' says former IDF intel chief
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI)
*  Now we're going to bring in the retired major general and former head of Israeli military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=0.0s)]
*  intelligence Amos Yadlin. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=4.44s)]
*  He's also joining us from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=6.32s)]
*  Welcome to the program. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=8.56s)]
*  You heard what I was asking the IDF spokesperson, and obviously it's very, very tough to figure [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=10.16s)]
*  out how to avenge this mass murder, while also, as he says, respecting the laws of war, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=17.64s)]
*  and also, as President Biden has said, that that must happen, and all your EU and U.N. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=24.28s)]
*  supporters as well. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=29.8s)]
*  So what do you think Amos Yadlin might happen in the coming up as these massacres are avenged [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=31.2s)]
*  when the defense minister, Yoav Galant, says they've removed all restraints from their [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=39.16s)]
*  soldiers? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=44.84s)]
*  What do you think that might mean? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=45.84s)]
*  Christina, we have to remember what happened on Saturday. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=48.92s)]
*  More than 1200 of Israeli citizens were killed brutally by the terror organization called [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=56.2s)]
*  Hamas, and by the way, by citizens from Gaza that followed them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=65.04s)]
*  It was a pogrom. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=71.64s)]
*  People were killed in families, children, women. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=73.92s)]
*  Women were raped. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=80.48s)]
*  People were killed. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=82.6s)]
*  When these were beheaded, this is something that you should not put behind you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=84.72s)]
*  It's very much like September 11, and it's very much like your war on ISIS. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=89.96s)]
*  And when the U.S. attacked Mosul or Raqqa, there were some collateral damage. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=97.68s)]
*  And this is what is going to happen to Gaza, because Israel, that helped the people of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=106.52s)]
*  Gaza by letting them come to work in Israel, by letting them have the Qatari money, were [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=112.76s)]
*  misled by an unbelievable, brutal government of Hamas. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=120.12s)]
*  And this government of Hamas is going to pay the way the Nazis paid in Europe, the way [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=129.04s)]
*  ISIS and Al-Qaeda paid when they attacked Americans. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=136.04s)]
*  So we changed the rules of the game. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  However, we will continue to fight according to the international law, as American forces [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=144.64s)]
*  fought according to the international law. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  And the international law is saying if you want to win the war, you have to target your [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=154.72s)]
*  enemies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=160.64s)]
*  And there is the proportionality principle that allows that some collateral damage will [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=161.64s)]
*  be there to achieve the objective of winning the war. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  And we are in war. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=177.48s)]
*  I know that. And I now want to ask you, from your perspective and from what you know from [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=179.16s)]
*  your position, what is the actual objective? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=183.27999999999997s)]
*  I don't know whether an actual objective has been announced by the prime minister, other [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=186.32s)]
*  than, you know, obviously avenging what happened and also decimating and changing the rules [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=191.6s)]
*  of the game, decimating Hamas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=199.24s)]
*  And as one IDF spokesman said today, changing the rules of the day. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=201.48s)]
*  What exactly does that mean? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=204.48s)]
*  Does that mean, you know, fighting until there's no longer Hamas in charge or anywhere able [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=206.24s)]
*  to exert any authority in Gaza? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, changing the paradigm. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=215.88s)]
*  The paradigm was we can live with Hamas. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=219.56s)]
*  It is a deterred organization. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=223.04s)]
*  We may need to have a mini war around every four or five years, but they will not go to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=226.84s)]
*  a full scale war. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=233.44s)]
*  This paradigm was wrong. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=235.72s)]
*  We allowed them to build up a military that swattened Israel and destroyed the whole region [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=237.5s)]
*  of Western Negev. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=247.4s)]
*  This is not going to happen again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=249.84s)]
*  So to your question, the objective is to reduce Hamas' capability to threaten Israel to the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=251.56s)]
*  minimum possible. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=261.88s)]
*  And this means destroying their military power and destroying their government's power. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=264.36s)]
*  So does that mean, Amos Yadlin, does that mean that Israel then what? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=271.2s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=276.24s)]
*  Is Israel also counting in the possibility of going back in and ruling? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=278.08s)]
*  What happens when that happens? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=284.56s)]
*  We will do what is needed. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=288.24s)]
*  At that time, we are still in the process of clearing Western Negev from Hamas murderers [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=290.56s)]
*  and restore the defense. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=300.12s)]
*  But at the same time, the Israeli Air Force is conducting a very aggressive bombing campaign [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=304.88s)]
*  against any target that belongs to Hamas in Gaza. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=312.72s)]
*  And unlike the past, we are not giving a specific warning. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=317.5s)]
*  In the past, we used to pick the phone and to call the terrorists and tell them, please [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=321.94s)]
*  evacuate your apartment. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=327.28s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=331.12s)]
*  Things that are connected to Hamas, command posts, intelligence posts, logistics, production, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=333.11999999999995s)]
*  will be targeted all over Gaza until we will reduce their capability to threaten Israel [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=341.84s)]
*  close to zero. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=350.76s)]
*  Close to zero. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=352.76s)]
*  And I must tell you another thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=353.76s)]
*  We are living in the Middle East. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=355.67999999999995s)]
*  As we saw when you are weak and your enemy taking over, it's a pogrom. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=358.24s)]
*  We need to show, to demonstrate to other enemies like Hezbollah, like Syria, like Iran, that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  anybody who is dreaming about duplicating what Hamas have done will suffer some things [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=375.8s)]
*  that they haven't dreamed about. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=383.62s)]
*  And Gaza is a way to rebuild our deterrence. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=386.0s)]
*  So it's going to be a very, very aggressive campaign. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=391.84s)]
*  I hear you loud and clear, and I guess everybody will be hearing you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=396.6s)]
*  So I guess I want to ask you, you're saying very clearly to rebuild the deterrence because [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=400.28s)]
*  I'm assuming you agree what happened on Saturday knocked the superiority of Israel on its head. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=405.6s)]
*  I mean, the idea that the military, the intelligence, everybody was caught so much by surprise, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=413.48s)]
*  destroyed the decades old myth of Israel's superiority. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=419.16s)]
*  I assume that's what you're saying and you need to regain that. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  But how do you imagine as head of former head of military intelligence that that happened [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=428.24s)]
*  in the first place? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=432.76s)]
*  I tell you again, there will be an aerial campaign against any target belonging to Hamas [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=433.76s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=444.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=445.88s)]
*  And there are thousands of them. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=446.88s)]
*  And then, and then don't rule out a military move on the ground. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=447.88s)]
*  Because I'm a big believer in air power. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=456.12s)]
*  I'm a fighter pilot in my background. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=458.88s)]
*  But there are places and missions that cannot be done from there. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=461.4s)]
*  So don't rule out a ground operations that once again will go to every place that we [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=466.73999999999995s)]
*  know that Hamas are there, especially the leader that ordered the leaders that order [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  the attack. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=484.67999999999995s)]
*  They will not be in Gaza at the end of the day. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=486.23999999999995s)]
*  They will not be in Gaza. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=488.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=491.52s)]
*  Amos Yadlin, I want to continue. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=492.52s)]
*  Once again, pay attention to the nose. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=495.76s)]
*  Pay attention to the nose. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=498.88s)]
*  Because what is happening in Gaza may affect the nose, but we can speak about it tomorrow. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes, we are keeping an eye on it, by the way. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  And we did ask the IDF spokesman and thank you very much indeed for your for being with [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=508.0s)]
*  us tonight. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UoGKEuW7jI&t=513.3199999999999s)]
