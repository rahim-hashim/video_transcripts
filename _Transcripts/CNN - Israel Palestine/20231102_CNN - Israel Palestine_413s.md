# US intel: Hezbollah could be getting Russian missile system
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA)
*  Just moments ago, a flares seen across the sky in Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=0.0s)]
*  just as we were coming to air. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=4.04s)]
*  We are right now witnessing in the midst of this, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  wherever you're watching, in Gaza, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=8.18s)]
*  the biggest air assault for anyone who is there [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=10.28s)]
*  on that 25-mile strip since this war began on October 7th. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=12.86s)]
*  And it comes as our CNN team in northern Israel [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=17.0s)]
*  is also now witnessing rocket fire [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=19.12s)]
*  from Iranian-backed forces in Lebanon into Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=20.86s)]
*  This is a pivotal moment, a crucial moment. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  The leader of Hezbollah, in fact, is about to speak [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=26.6s)]
*  for the first time since the war began. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  And what he says could change the trajectory of the war. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=31.36s)]
*  Jim Schidow is out front on the ground. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=34.66s)]
*  And Jim, what have you been seeing there today? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=36.64s)]
*  Well, this whole past week and longer, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=41.32s)]
*  we've seen an exchange of fire along this northern border, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=43.72s)]
*  mostly artillery fire, mortar fire. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=47.56s)]
*  Today, though, we saw the sky filled, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=51.2s)]
*  rockets coming from Lebanon into northern Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=53.64s)]
*  And then we also saw Israeli missile defense [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=58.44s)]
*  high in the sky, taking out some of those rockets. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=61.8s)]
*  Did not appear they got all of them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=65.16s)]
*  Israeli fire jets higher up in the sky, responding as well. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=67.22s)]
*  Helicopters moving in both directions. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=71.96s)]
*  Just a level of activity in the sky [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=74.58s)]
*  that shows the level of alarm today on the border [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=77.12s)]
*  as the attacks stepped up, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=81.24s)]
*  coming in from Hezbollah and southern Lebanon, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=83.36s)]
*  and fears of the opening of a new front. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=86.08s)]
*  A rocket fired from southern Lebanon [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=92.64s)]
*  sets the street on fire in Kiryat Shemona. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=94.96s)]
*  Today, northern Israel suffered under one of the biggest [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  barrages of rockets since the start of the war. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Our team witnessed the Iron Dome missile defense system [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=104.58s)]
*  intercept two incoming rockets, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  though at least one other caused substantial damage. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=110.72s)]
*  In response, the Israeli military fired back [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=113.9s)]
*  at what it says is the culprit, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=116.62s)]
*  Hezbollah sits on a massive stockpile of rockets and missiles, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  far bigger than that of Hamas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=124.76s)]
*  Numbering more than 100,000, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  many have the range and accuracy [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=130.1s)]
*  to strike deep into Israeli territory, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=131.94s)]
*  including all the way to Tel Aviv. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=134.62s)]
*  And this is one sign of how seriously [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  Israel is taking the Hezbollah threat. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  Today, we watched Israeli special forces and tank units [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=140.68s)]
*  conduct a live-fire exercise, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=145.68s)]
*  training to defend Israel in case of invasion from the north. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=148.68s)]
*  These are combined arms exercises, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=154.68s)]
*  Israeli special forces, IDF special forces here. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=157.68s)]
*  There's also two tanks involved in this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=160.68s)]
*  It is live-fire. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=163.68s)]
*  It's a measure of the seriousness [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=165.68s)]
*  with which they're keeping their forces trained up, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=167.68s)]
*  ready to go if necessary in the north. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=170.68s)]
*  But also, given that we're within sight of Syria here [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=173.68s)]
*  and just a few miles from the Lebanon border, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=177.68s)]
*  this is also a show of force to Iran's proxies in the region. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=179.68s)]
*  A show of force, perhaps, to this man, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=185.68s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Hezbollah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=188.68s)]
*  To his admirers in the Muslim world, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=191.68s)]
*  he is a leader of the resistance. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=193.68s)]
*  Credited with forcing Israeli forces out of southern Lebanon in 2000 [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=195.68s)]
*  after an 18-year occupation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=200.68s)]
*  To Israel, he is an existential threat on its northern border. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=203.68s)]
*  Tomorrow, he will address his followers and the world [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=207.68s)]
*  for the first time since the October 7th Hamas attacks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=210.68s)]
*  The question for many, will he order his forces [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=214.68s)]
*  to join the war against Israel more aggressively? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=217.68s)]
*  They have the capacity to do enormous damage, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=220.68s)]
*  but I'm not certain that they really want to be on the receiving end [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=224.68s)]
*  of what Israel is going to send their way. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=228.68s)]
*  The threat of escalation extends beyond Hezbollah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=231.68s)]
*  Yemen-based Houthi rebels, also backed by Iran, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=234.68s)]
*  are firing long-range missiles at Israel from the southeast. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=238.68s)]
*  Another potential front in a war that would see Israel surround it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=241.68s)]
*  As the world awaits the words of Hezbollah's leader, Nasrallah, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=246.68s)]
*  Hezbollah fighters issued their own public letter earlier this week [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=250.68s)]
*  saying that their hands, their fingers are on the trigger. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=254.68s)]
*  Israeli officials have had their own strong words [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=258.68s)]
*  communicating to Hezbollah via interlocutors in Europe [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=261.68s)]
*  that if Hezbollah gets into this war in numbers, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=265.68s)]
*  that Israel will strike back deep into Lebanon. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=268.68s)]
*  Stronger than the Israeli forces, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=272.68s)]
*  Lebanon, strong words now and now all eyes tomorrow [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=275.68s)]
*  on the words of the Hezbollah leader, Erin. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=279.68s)]
*  Very sobering. Jim, thank you very much. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=282.68s)]
*  And more breaking news on this because CNN is now learning [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=285.68s)]
*  that Syria has agreed to provide Hezbollah [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=288.68s)]
*  with a Russian-made missile defense system. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=292.68s)]
*  And Orin Lieberman is out front at the Pentagon breaking this news. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=295.68s)]
*  And Orin, you are just getting these breaking details from your reporting. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=298.68s)]
*  This obviously would be a very significant and very serious development. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=301.68s)]
*  What more are you learning? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=305.68s)]
*  Erin, according to two sources familiar with the intelligence, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=307.68s)]
*  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has agreed to provide [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=310.68s)]
*  a Russian-made aerial defense system to Hezbollah. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=313.68s)]
*  And it is the Russian mercenary group Wagner that will transfer that SA-22 [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=316.68s)]
*  or Pantsir missile defense system from Syria to Lebanon [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=321.68s)]
*  where it could be set up to be used. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=324.68s)]
*  Now, what's unclear from the intelligence, according to these sources, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=326.68s)]
*  is whether the system has already been transferred. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=329.68s)]
*  It is a medium-range air defense system [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=332.68s)]
*  and would add to Hezbollah's capabilities if and when it arrives in Lebanon. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=335.68s)]
*  Now, the Israelis have dealt with this system in the past in Syria. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=339.68s)]
*  Take a look at this video. This is from May 2018. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=342.68s)]
*  This is video from the IDF of them striking an SA-22 in Syria [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=345.68s)]
*  that was operated by Iran or being used by Iranian proxies there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=350.68s)]
*  So they have shown the capability to handle these systems [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=354.68s)]
*  and to strike them from the air. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=357.68s)]
*  But of course, now the situation is entirely different [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=359.68s)]
*  with Israel embroiled with a war in Gaza [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=361.68s)]
*  and the possibility that Hezbollah could enter this in a much more significant fashion. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=364.68s)]
*  So even if Israel has dealt with the SA-22 before, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=368.68s)]
*  certainly not under these circumstances. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=371.68s)]
*  And that's what everyone here is watching very closely. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=374.68s)]
*  According to other sources on the matter, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=377.68s)]
*  so far the U.S. believes that Iran and its proxies don't want to get involved in a big way. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=380.68s)]
*  But of course, as Jim pointed out, the speech from Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=384.68s)]
*  everyone is watching that speech to see where this goes and what it means. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=388.68s)]
*  It's also worth pointing out the common denominator here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=392.68s)]
*  Hezbollah backed by Iran, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad backed by Iran. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=395.68s)]
*  And they have worked with Russia there, which has also backed Assad [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=399.68s)]
*  and provided that Wagner support. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=403.68s)]
*  So you see the ties here linking all of these different groups, Erin. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=405.68s)]
*  Absolutely. Thank you very much, Oren Lieberman. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BjBr7Kf8rA&t=409.68s)]
