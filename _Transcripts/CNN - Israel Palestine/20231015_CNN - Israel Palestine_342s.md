# Hear what the Israeli ambassador to the US says about plans for Gaza after war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY)
*  Joining me now in studio is Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=0.0s)]
*  Before I start, of course, I want to offer my deepest condolences to the Israeli people [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=5.5s)]
*  about what happened eight days ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=10.06s)]
*  Just a horrific, horrific attack, a terrorist attack. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  I think I speak for all of my viewers and everybody at CNN when I say our hearts are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=17.48s)]
*  just broken by what happened. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=22.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=24.68s)]
*  I really appreciate that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=25.68s)]
*  This ground incursion that we expect in the next, can you give me any sort of sense of [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=29.8s)]
*  timing next week? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=37.0s)]
*  I know you have 300,000 reservists on the border. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=38.8s)]
*  Is it an operation to rid Hamas of its military capabilities, its terrorist capabilities, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=42.04s)]
*  or is it an operation to destroy Hamas completely? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=48.0s)]
*  As you noted, Israel was attacked. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=53.34s)]
*  Hamas waged war on Israel and they carried out one of the worst terror attacks in world [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=56.64s)]
*  history, if not the worst. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=61.64s)]
*  We have no choice but to strike back. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=64.44s)]
*  We are determined to destroy the Hamas war machine so that they cannot threaten us again. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=67.44s)]
*  We do not want to be in that game where every few years they launch war against us or provoke [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=74.2s)]
*  us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=81.68s)]
*  That's over. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=82.92s)]
*  We are determined to destroy the war machine. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=83.92s)]
*  We are preparing a ground operation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=87.36s)]
*  I'm not going to go into details and timetables and all that, but we are at war and we're [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=89.12s)]
*  going to fight that war. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=94.64s)]
*  And what is the plan for after you accomplish the objective? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=96.36s)]
*  What does the end state after the operation look like? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=100.58s)]
*  Will Israel re-occupy the Gaza Strip? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  Will any Palestinians who fled Gaza be allowed back in? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=106.92s)]
*  We have no desire to occupy or re-occupy Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  We have no desire to rule over the lives of over two million Palestinians and certainly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=116.9s)]
*  want people to go back to their homes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=121.84s)]
*  We're talking about innocent civilians and we are doing everything we can to keep them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  out of harm's way while Hamas is doing everything it can to keep them in harm's way. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=130.12s)]
*  That's the situation we are at. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=135.96s)]
*  I think talking about the day after is a bit premature because crushing the Hamas war machine [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=137.72s)]
*  will require time. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=144.11999999999998s)]
*  The questions you raise are valid and I think we will have to enter discussions with our [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=147.0s)]
*  partners, with international communities about the day after. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  Aarant's editorial this week said, quote, Israel's most urgent task is to bring back [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  the Israelis held by Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  They point out that your finance minister, Bezalel Smotrik, reportedly argued in a cabinet [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=167.04s)]
*  meeting for Israel to, quote, strike Hamas brutally and not take the issue of the captives [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=173.16s)]
*  into account too much. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  And what Haarant is arguing is, why not? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=181.32s)]
*  Why aren't the captives, why aren't the kidnapping victims the number one priority? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=184.44s)]
*  Well, certainly the issue of the kidnap, Israelis and others, is very much, is high on our agenda. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=190.88s)]
*  We are well aware of that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  We're still in the process of forming a picture, understanding how many people are there, what [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=201.2s)]
*  is their condition, what is their identity. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  And certainly this is a consideration. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=209.44s)]
*  I don't want to comment about statements by this or that politician. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=211.12s)]
*  All we say is that Hamas perpetrated a war crime and crime against humanity and taking [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=216.84s)]
*  hostages, and that we hold them accountable to any harm that comes to any of the hostages. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  Hamas is claiming that Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 13 of the hostages in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=229.32s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=233.12s)]
*  Do you have any idea if that's true? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=234.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=235.6s)]
*  I would be very careful about what they say. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=236.6s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation and propaganda there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=239.32s)]
*  So I would be very careful and I would take what they say with a grain of salt. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=244.24s)]
*  You said a week ago it was premature to discuss any deals for exchanging hostages. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=250.12s)]
*  Has that changed? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=254.88s)]
*  Is there any discussion about any prisoner swaps, hostage swaps? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=255.88s)]
*  We're not at that phase. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  And as I said, we're in the middle of war and we still have to know how many hostages [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=261.8s)]
*  there are and what is their condition. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=267.44s)]
*  So you obviously distinguish between Hamas and the 2.3 million Palestinians, many of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=270.28s)]
*  whom are prisoners of Hamas in Gaza. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=276.28s)]
*  Israel has warned the 1.1 million in northern Gaza to evacuate. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  And the U.S. officials, the U.S. has even said that's a tall order. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=286.55999999999995s)]
*  The U.N. has said it's impossible to get them all out. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  What's the latest on these humanitarian quarters and letting the innocent victims of Hamas's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=293.2s)]
*  in many ways get out? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  So I'm glad you asked the question. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  Our enemy is Hamas. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=304.16s)]
*  It's not the Palestinian people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not the innocent civilians. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=307.72s)]
*  Many of them are dying because of Israeli bombardment. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=309.36s)]
*  They are used by Hamas as human shields. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=312.44s)]
*  That's why we call on them to leave their homes because as we intensify the war against [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  Hamas and Hamas war machine, we don't want to harm any civilians. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  And we ask them to move to the south of Gaza. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=325.12s)]
*  Hamas, in contrast, is asking them to stay, is forcing them to stay. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=328.6s)]
*  Right, they're setting up blockades. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=334.04s)]
*  They are confiscating car keys and so on. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=335.88s)]
*  We see all that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=339.8s)]
*  They want to use them as human shields. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTgMZmSdkHY&t=340.8s)]
