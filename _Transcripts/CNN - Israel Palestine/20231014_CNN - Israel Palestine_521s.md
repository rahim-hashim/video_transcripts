# Why Gaetz doesn't regret ousting McCarthy, even amid Israel-Hamas conflict
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU)
*  The House finally get a speaker so that it can get back to work. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=0.0s)]
*  Friday, Ohio GOP Congressman Jim Jordan was nominated to be speaker after garnering support [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=3.24s)]
*  from both deposed speaker Kevin McCarthy and from Fox anchor Sean Hannity. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=8.4s)]
*  Without a leader, the GOP has frozen the chamber during several looming crises, from Israel's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=12.6s)]
*  war against Hamas to a potential government shutdown now just 34 days away. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  It's unclear if Jordan can win enough support from the entire House to get the requisite [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=21.56s)]
*  217 votes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=25.84s)]
*  In a secret ballot on Friday, he still had 55 Republicans opposed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=27.6s)]
*  Joining me now is the person who started this whole chain of events by pushing for McCarthy's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=31.52s)]
*  ouster, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=35.16s)]
*  Congressman, do you regret ousting Kevin McCarthy given that Israel is now at war with Hamas [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=37.76s)]
*  and we don't have a speaker? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=42.8s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=45.08s)]
*  The United States stands with Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=46.32s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself and there is no need expressed by Israel that the United [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=48.08s)]
*  States has not been able to meet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=52.6s)]
*  That's because we have Israel essentially on auto pay. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=54.4s)]
*  As a consequence of legislation that was passed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the administration [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=57.96s)]
*  is pre-authorized to meet any need that Israel could possibly express in this particular [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=63.7s)]
*  phase of the crisis. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=69.62s)]
*  My expectation is that we will elect speaker designate Jim Jordan as House speaker next [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=71.02s)]
*  week and will be prepared to move forward with resolutions of support. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=75.48s)]
*  But those are non-binding expressions of our opinion when it comes to the movement of specific [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=79.68s)]
*  materiel and the coordination on intelligence. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=84.44s)]
*  We are pre-authorized because our relationship with Israel is that unique. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=87.88s)]
*  How do you think that Jordan crosses the finish line with 217 if there were 55 votes against [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=92.62s)]
*  him, as is being reported, you were there, 55 votes against him on that second ballot [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=98.2s)]
*  last night? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=102.84s)]
*  Well, I think it's important to understand how that math moved. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=103.84s)]
*  Initially there were 81 votes against Jim Jordan and then about 30 minutes later there [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=107.32s)]
*  were only 55 votes against Jim Jordan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=111.78s)]
*  So on that trajectory he seems to be gaining a good amount of momentum. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=113.88s)]
*  Also it's important to note that those 55 no votes on Jordan were on a secret anonymous [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=117.88s)]
*  ballot like in the basement of the Longworth office building. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=122.64s)]
*  It's quite a different thing to stand on the floor of the House of Representatives and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=126.69999999999999s)]
*  vote against the second most popular living Republican in America. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=131.0s)]
*  I know how hard it is to stand on the floor and vote against the party's choice. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=135.4s)]
*  I did it to extract concessions that I thought were meaningful that unfortunately the former [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=140.48s)]
*  speaker did not live up to. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=144.64s)]
*  But my expectation is that next week we will elect Jim Jordan. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  Frankly, Michael, I think we probably could have done it last night and I would have preferred [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=150.6s)]
*  that path. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=154.48s)]
*  But Speaker Emeritus McCarthy said that he wanted Jim Jordan's family to be able to be [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=155.76s)]
*  there, his supporters to be able to be there. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=161.12s)]
*  And I guess one thing that Kevin McCarthy and I agree on, Jim Jordan's going to be the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=163.6s)]
*  next speaker of the House. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=167.12s)]
*  You've heard the criticisms, right, from people, including in your own caucus, I think one [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=169.24s)]
*  member who said that it's a group of idiots who have led us down this path. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=172.68s)]
*  Others say we look third worldish at a time when we need to be looking as a model for [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=176.36s)]
*  democracies around the globe. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=181.52s)]
*  How do you respond to those who say that the whole perception of the United States and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=183.32s)]
*  the dysfunction of Congress is what has arisen out of your ouster of Kevin McCarthy? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=187.72s)]
*  I find it a little ridiculous, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=193.52s)]
*  Oh, no, the world is ending because the House of Representatives isn't passing ceremonial [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=195.92s)]
*  resolutions this week. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=200.4s)]
*  The entire United States Senate was out all week. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=201.56s)]
*  The House of Representatives takes seven weeks off every single year for essentially a summer [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=205.0s)]
*  vacation. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=210.32s)]
*  There are days when all we vote on are procedural votes and post offices. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=211.12s)]
*  So I think that the chaos narrative is a bit overplayed, particularly in the Beltway, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=215.68s)]
*  because the lobbyists and the special interests want someone in the speakership that they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=221.32s)]
*  totally control. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=225.72s)]
*  They had that in Kevin McCarthy. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=227.08s)]
*  And just because lobbyists and special interests have been disempowered by the motion of [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=229.04s)]
*  AK doesn't mean it was the wrong decision. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=233.8s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that, like, we're in chaos because there were 10 days when the lights [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  were off on the House floor. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=240.12s)]
*  We have not put our pencils down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=241.28s)]
*  This last week, we were getting classified briefings on the evolving situation in the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=242.96s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=246.72s)]
*  I was taking depositions of former and current Department of Justice officials as a pursuant [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=247.44s)]
*  to our oversight work. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=252.72s)]
*  So don't believe that just because there isn't floor action that somehow all of our [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=254.0s)]
*  representatives aren't working. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=258.32s)]
*  We, in fact, are continuing the work of the Congress. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=259.76s)]
*  I heard the point that you made. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=262.24s)]
*  Everybody heard the point that you made about a quote unquote auto pay for Israel to the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=263.48s)]
*  extent there's congressional action required of any kind vis-a-vis Israel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=267.84s)]
*  Will you be seeking to tie it to support for Ukraine? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=273.6s)]
*  Well, no, I'll be seeking to to untether any question about Ukraine from any question on [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=277.20000000000005s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's important you ask that question, because when we were briefed, well, I think [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=284.72s)]
*  that they deserve their own vote and their own dignity. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=288.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  However you feel about Israel and however you feel about Ukraine, I think that a responsible [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=290.6s)]
*  and reasonable government ought to address those questions separately. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=296.0s)]
*  They shouldn't be lashed together. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  For example, I would support meeting additional requests from Israel for aid. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=301.92s)]
*  I would not for Ukraine. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  So mushing things together, log rolling them, that is the old way of Washington. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=308.36s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to change, whether it's our budgeting process or our foreign aid. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  I want individual votes on separate and disparate questions. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=317.88s)]
*  I don't want OK, but many of your colleagues, many of your colleagues don't share that view. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=321.2s)]
*  Is that your understanding? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=326.44s)]
*  In other words, those who seek to diminish United States support for Ukraine are now [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=327.72s)]
*  looking to this Israel issue as a means of doing so. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=333.04s)]
*  We're like unless unless we get a reduced role for Ukraine, we're not going to support [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=336.56s)]
*  Israel to the extent you'd like us to. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=341.72s)]
*  That's a sentiment that I'm hearing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=343.6s)]
*  Well, that is not the sentiment from the administration. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  The administration is trying to combine the question. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  I am trying to separate the question. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=350.56s)]
*  And one of the concessions that we did get in House rules that will outlast Speaker McCarthy [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=352.36s)]
*  is the ability in the rules committee to be able to raise points of order and raise questions [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  to try to separate those things. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=362.4s)]
*  In fact, when we had our defense bill, our eight hundred eighty six billion dollar defense [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=363.8s)]
*  bill, Marjorie Taylor Greene was successful in getting a separate vote on the 300 million [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=367.64s)]
*  for Ukraine because of those single subject concessions we got in January. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=372.8s)]
*  That 300 million for Ukraine still passed, but it passed with a majority of Republicans [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=377.6s)]
*  voting against it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=382.64s)]
*  So now we have for anyone to move legislation to support Ukraine, they would have to roll [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=383.84s)]
*  a majority of the Republicans who now believe we should be less involved in that conflict, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=390.52s)]
*  but that in no way diminishes our support for Israel, which is very strong in a bipartisan [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=394.91999999999996s)]
*  fashion. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=400.44s)]
*  Final quick question. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=401.44s)]
*  What's your answer to my poll question today? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=403.08s)]
*  Should the Biden administration encourage, quote unquote, de-escalation in Gaza? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  I knew I was getting this question. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=410.32s)]
*  I think the Biden administration should be most focused on really putting pressure on [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=411.8s)]
*  Egypt to set up refugee camps and passageways. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  You only de-escalate after the military operations are concluded. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=419.16s)]
*  So my answer to the question would be no today. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=423.76000000000005s)]
*  But I think our diplomatic efforts should be focused on humanitarian passageways to [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=426.5s)]
*  get civilians out of Gaza. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=430.8s)]
*  If we have a pile of, you know, dead Muslim kids, that could increase the amount of terrorism [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=432.76000000000005s)]
*  in the world, not decrease it, though I understand Israel's very sincere and legitimate efforts [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=437.68s)]
*  to destroy Hamas once and for all. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=443.12s)]
*  But Catherine, put the social media up there. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=446.24s)]
*  It's probably a complaint either about Gates or me hosting him. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=448.12s)]
*  So maybe he'll want to respond. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=451.72s)]
*  Quote, Jordan is the worst of the bad choices for speaker. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=453.72s)]
*  Further proof that the GOP cannot govern effectively for all of America. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=457.68s)]
*  You'd say what to that person at X? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=462.56s)]
*  Yeah, at X76, I guess I'm glad you're not a member of the United States Congress, because [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=465.16s)]
*  if you were, you'd know that Jim Jordan is a good man, a virtuous man, someone who is [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  broadly respected across the Republican conference. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=475.04s)]
*  And you know where he stands. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=478.16s)]
*  That's a distinction between Jim Jordan and Kevin McCarthy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  It's one of the reasons I'm so excited to make him House speaker. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=482.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=484.76s)]
*  But people like me say, hey, McCarthy was willing to reach across the aisle and keep [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=485.76s)]
*  the government functioning. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=489.04s)]
*  McCarthy was willing to reach across the aisle and raise the debt ceiling, lest we would [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=490.48s)]
*  have suffered default. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  Those are those are good things. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=494.72s)]
*  Ten seconds, you get the final word. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=496.44s)]
*  Well, I think that Kevin McCarthy was ousted by Democrats and Republicans because he made [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=498.8s)]
*  multiple contradictory promises that he never intended to keep. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  Jim Jordan puts us back on a path to fiscal sanity and he gets the Republican Party back [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=507.76s)]
*  into the fighting posture. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=512.72s)]
*  We need to be in to win elections and push our policy objectives. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=513.72s)]
*  Congressman Gates, thank you for coming back. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMALiXAduU&t=517.48s)]
