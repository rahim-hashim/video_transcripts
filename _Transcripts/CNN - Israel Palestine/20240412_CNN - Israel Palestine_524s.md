Video Description: The US says it is on high alert for a significant Iranian retaliatory attack on Israel as fears grow of a wider regional war. There remains a “real,” “credible” and “viable” threat of Iran launching strikes, the White House said, following Israel’s attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria last week that killed three Iranian generals.  #CNN #News

# White House says it is watching Iranian threat ‘very, very closely’
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk)
*  CNN has learned that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with his war cabinet [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=0.0s)]
*  just ahead of what they anticipate could be a potential attack from Iran. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=5.04s)]
*  It comes after an Israeli airstrike hit the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria, last [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=9.88s)]
*  week, killing a dozen Iranian military officials. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  The Pentagon says the top U.S. general for the Middle East is in Israel right now meeting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=18.44s)]
*  with Israeli military officials about the security threats. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=22.86s)]
*  And the White House tells CNN that officials there are keeping a very close eye on the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=26.64s)]
*  situation and are in constant communication with Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Let's get to the latest reporting from our correspondents. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=36.4s)]
*  CNN international diplomatic editor Nick Robertson is joining us from Jerusalem. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=38.92s)]
*  And our Natasha Bertrand is over at the Pentagon. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Nick, first to you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  First of all, what can you tell us about this Israeli war cabinet meeting? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=47.64s)]
*  How concerned are Israelis right now that Iran could launch an attack, a retaliatory [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=50.84s)]
*  attack against Israel? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=55.88s)]
*  There's a real concern, Wolf, that Iran could do that in the coming 24 or 48 hours. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  I've talked to various intelligence sources in the region at the moment. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=65.44s)]
*  They understand, and this is what we're getting from a lot of different sources, that Iran [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=70.64s)]
*  is poised to respond. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=75.76s)]
*  Now, of course, this could be Iran intentionally disinforming, putting disinformation out there [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  just to create the sense of jitters among the Israeli public here, among the leadership [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=83.84s)]
*  in Israel about precisely what they'll do. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=89.2s)]
*  And it's unclear what they'll do. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  Will they respond and strike back directly to Israel themselves? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=93.48s)]
*  Will they use proxies to strike into Israel? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=97.56s)]
*  Will they strike Israeli interests elsewhere in the region? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=99.88s)]
*  That's a question on people's minds at the moment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=103.92s)]
*  But that strength and show of unity and support between the United States and Israel is on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=106.16s)]
*  display today at the Hadsor Air Base in the south of Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=111.44s)]
*  The Ascent Command Commander General Eric Karilla there with Yorav Golan, the Israeli [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=115.16s)]
*  Defense Minister, the Deputy IDF Chief of Staff also there. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=120.2s)]
*  So this is very much a message of unity and strength and preparedness. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=124.64s)]
*  So this is what we heard from Rear Admiral Daniel Higari, the IDF's spokesperson just [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=128.32s)]
*  last night, speaking about how prepared Israel is for whatever threat comes from Iran. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=134.6s)]
*  We're highly alert and prepared for a wide range of scenarios and are conducting a situational [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=142.4s)]
*  assessment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  We're ready in both defense and offense with the various IDF capabilities and strategic [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  partners. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=153.6s)]
*  A strike coming from Iranian territory will clearly prove the Iranian intentions to escalate [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=157.07999999999998s)]
*  the situation in the Middle East and to stop hiding behind its proxies. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=161.8s)]
*  And I think you get a level of the understanding of how this concern is shared jointly between [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=169.0s)]
*  the United States and Israel, the State Department and the embassy here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  Warning staff not to stray beyond the sort of Tel Aviv area, Jerusalem area, Be'er Sheva [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=179.44s)]
*  area. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=184.24s)]
*  Stay in those areas. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=185.24s)]
*  The concern is it's just not clear what Iran's move is going to be, the sense that it could [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=186.78s)]
*  be soon, Wolf. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=191.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of concern in those. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=192.56s)]
*  The U.S. embassy and other embassies in Israel as well are issuing warnings to their citizens [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=195.08s)]
*  to stay put basically and worry, start worrying about the potential. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=200.08s)]
*  Let's hope it doesn't happen, about the potential of this war escalating big time between Israel [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=204.84s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=209.24s)]
*  Natasha, I want to go to the Pentagon with you for a moment. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=210.24s)]
*  The top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, the commander of the U.S. military central [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  command is in Israel right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=218.84s)]
*  We just heard Nick talk about that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  What do we know about his trip? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  The coordination that's going on between the United States and Israel in anticipation, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=223.94s)]
*  in fear of a formal, a full scale Iranian retaliatory response. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=228.82s)]
*  Well, Wolf, Eric Carilla, the top general for the Middle East, he did say that the U.S. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=233.74s)]
*  and the Pentagon did say also that the U.S. stands with Israel against any potential attack [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=241.18s)]
*  that Iran might launch against the Israelis. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=246.38s)]
*  And President Biden made this very clear as well, that they are in constant coordination [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=249.18s)]
*  with the Israelis to prepare for the possibility that they do launch some kind of attack directly [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=253.42s)]
*  on Israeli soil. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=258.62s)]
*  And according to a readout from the Israeli side, General Eric Carilla, he did meet with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=259.62s)]
*  Yov Galant today to discuss readiness for an Iranian attack against the state of Israel, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=263.53999999999996s)]
*  which may lead to regional escalation. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=268.94s)]
*  So clearly all sides here are bracing for the possibility that this escalates into a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=271.46s)]
*  full on conflict between Iran and Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=275.32s)]
*  However, U.S. intelligence assessments, as we reported a little bit earlier in the week, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=278.3s)]
*  they assess that this is more likely to be carried out by Iranian proxy forces in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=282.42s)]
*  region rather than from Iran directly. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=287.1s)]
*  And that is for a number of reasons. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=289.14s)]
*  But most prominently is because the Iranians don't necessarily want to get involved in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=290.94s)]
*  a full blown war with Israel that the U.S., as they have stated publicly, would then come [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  to Israel's defense with. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=300.68s)]
*  So the Iranians trying to kind of temper their response according to our sources. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=302.26s)]
*  However, it is very possible at this point, according to intelligence assessments, that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  these Iranian proxies carry out attacks against Israeli assets in the region. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=310.74s)]
*  And so all sides kind of bracing for that and importantly, how Israel is going to respond, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=315.74s)]
*  because that is also going to inform just how much this conflict escalates, Wolf. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=320.66s)]
*  So Natasha, just to be precise, if Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy in southern Lebanon, starts [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=325.62s)]
*  launching rockets and missiles, bombs towards Haifa, Tel Aviv, elsewhere in Israel, the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=331.22s)]
*  Israelis presumably would respond big time against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=337.7s)]
*  try to destroy their capability. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=342.7s)]
*  But it wouldn't necessarily attack directly Iranian targets in Iran. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=345.14s)]
*  Is that the U.S. understanding as well? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=349.7s)]
*  Well, it's not clear just whether the U.S. would characterize an attack by an Iranian [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=352.34s)]
*  proxy against Israel as an attack by Iran itself. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=358.02s)]
*  The U.S. has made very clear, of course, that the proxies are only able to function and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=361.26s)]
*  really survive because of Iranian support for them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=365.22s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, it would definitely be a layer removed from Iran itself if the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=368.58000000000004s)]
*  proxies were the ones carrying out these attacks. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=373.74s)]
*  However, Israel has said that they are going to respond forcibly to whatever kind of attack [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=375.70000000000005s)]
*  they are faced with by Iran or its proxies. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=380.74s)]
*  And so it just remains to be seen how exactly this is going to play out. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=383.3s)]
*  Very important, very worrisome developments unfolding right now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=387.38000000000005s)]
*  Natasha, thank you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=391.18s)]
*  Nick, thanks to you as well. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=392.18s)]
*  I want to bring in CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Mark [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=393.78s)]
*  Kirtling. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=397.7s)]
*  General, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=398.7s)]
*  As you know, officials are telling CNN they expect Iran will respond imminently, keyword [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  imminently. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=406.09999999999997s)]
*  Do you think Iran is likely to strike Israel directly or could that happen through a proxy [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  like Hezbollah, for example, in Lebanon? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=411.85999999999996s)]
*  Everyone's asking that question, Wilpin. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=416.82s)]
*  What I'd say is General Corrilla is there because he's looking at what is the most dangerous [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  course of action that Iran will take and what's the most likely. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=422.94s)]
*  The most dangerous is a strike by Iran inside of Israel, because that could certainly cause [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=426.78s)]
*  an inflection point and expand this war. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=431.62s)]
*  The most likely, as all of your reporters, Natasha just said, is likely an attack by [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  any number of proxy groups, whether it's Hezbollah in Lebanon or any of the PMF forces in Iraq [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=439.67999999999995s)]
*  or Syria or in the area. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=446.29999999999995s)]
*  So that's what General Corrilla and probably he has some of his intelligence officers [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=448.98s)]
*  with him as well as some of his operators so that they can react with naval and air [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=454.14000000000004s)]
*  forces from the U.S. in case anything does happen, because the key is deterring any further [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=458.54s)]
*  expansion of this regional conflict. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  The Israeli strike on that Iranian consulate building in Damascus was what, about a week [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=468.42s)]
*  or so ago. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=473.48s)]
*  Why do you think Iran has not waited this long to respond? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=474.48s)]
*  They immediately issued warnings that they were going to respond, but they haven't yet. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=477.74s)]
*  Well, part of it is the messaging that Iran often uses. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=482.58s)]
*  And they're concerned about attacking inside of Israel, because truthfully, Wolf, as you [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=488.06s)]
*  know, Israel's force is pretty extensive and pretty competent. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=492.7s)]
*  They can certainly go after Iranian forces if they do these kind of things. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=496.86s)]
*  So I think Iran is trying to get their proxies together to determine what would be the best [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=501.48s)]
*  and most effective attacks by their proxies and potentially themselves without being deterred [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1xlEYfPiyk&t=506.74s)]
