# CNN asked US national security adviser about Israel using ‘dumb bombs’ in Gaza. Hear his response
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI)
*  This is CNN breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=0.0s)]
*  OK, happening right now, the US National Security Advisor [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=5.4s)]
*  Jake Sullivan is speaking in Tel Aviv after meeting with Israeli leaders. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=8.2s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=11.84s)]
*  President Biden on his visit on October 18th. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  And our message then is the same as my message today, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=16.8s)]
*  which is that the United States stands with Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=20.52s)]
*  As President Biden has said many times, Israel has a right, indeed a duty [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=23.84s)]
*  to defend itself against Hamas, a terrorist group that committed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=28.16s)]
*  the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=33.0s)]
*  that used rape and sexual violence to terrorize Israeli women, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  that continues to hold hostages, women, the elderly, the sick, the wounded [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=40.68s)]
*  and hide in tunnels they've purposely built under civilian infrastructure. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  And I'm here today on President Biden's behalf [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=51.24s)]
*  to emphasize our continued commitment to support Israel in its fight against Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=53.919999999999995s)]
*  Yesterday and today, I've met with Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=59.68s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=62.72s)]
*  President Herzog and a range of senior officials. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=65.6s)]
*  We discussed the ongoing war and military operations. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=68.72s)]
*  We discussed our shared objective of ensuring that Hamas will never again [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=72.28s)]
*  pose a threat to the state of Israel while minimizing harm to civilians, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=75.92s)]
*  while ensuring the increased and sustained flow of humanitarian assistance [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=80.08s)]
*  in the Gaza and while working day in and day out, hour by hour, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=83.8s)]
*  to secure the release of all of the remaining hostages [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=88.32s)]
*  so that they can return home to their loved ones. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=90.92s)]
*  We consulted on our joint efforts with the United Nations, with Egypt [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=93.8s)]
*  and other regional partners to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  We did not do a great job of putting the podium sign on. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=101.52s)]
*  And I described U.S. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=105.84s)]
*  efforts in coordination with allies and partners to deter attempts [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=107.0s)]
*  to expand the conflict regionally, including in the Red Sea, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=109.8s)]
*  and expressed President Biden's commitment to restoring calm [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=113.36s)]
*  along the blue line through a combination of deterrence and diplomacy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=116.08s)]
*  Later today, in fact, after I leave here, I will visit [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  Ramallah to meet with President Abbas and discuss ongoing efforts [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  to promote stability in the West Bank, including through efforts [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=126.92s)]
*  to confront terrorism, to support the Palestinian Authority [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=130.24s)]
*  security forces through the U.S. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=134.0s)]
*  security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=135.68s)]
*  through ongoing efforts to revamp and revitalize the Palestinian Authority [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=139.55999999999997s)]
*  and through initiatives to hold extremist settlers accountable [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=143.76s)]
*  for violence against Palestinians. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=146.6s)]
*  I have and will continue to state President Biden in the United States' [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=148.92s)]
*  commitment to preserving space for peace, for a two state solution [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  where Israel's security is guaranteed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli people need and deserve to live in peace and security [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  with their neighbors in a region that is integrated, dynamic and stable. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=162.76s)]
*  That is what we are working toward. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=166.92s)]
*  That is what I discussed with my counterparts and interlocutors here in Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=168.72s)]
*  And that is President Biden's fundamental vision for the future of this region. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=174.2s)]
*  And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=177.92s)]
*  And we'll start with Alex from CNN. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=179.8s)]
*  Thanks very much, Jake. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=183.52s)]
*  The administration has made it clear that you are hoping that this fight [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=185.68s)]
*  will transition at some point from this high intensity phase [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=188.64s)]
*  to a lower intensity phase. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=191.8s)]
*  What are the Israelis telling you in terms of the conditions [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=193.84s)]
*  that are needed for that to happen? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=196.92s)]
*  And how does that sync up with your preferred timeline? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=199.0s)]
*  And then if I may, the administration has insisted that Israel [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  has the intent to keep civilians safe. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  And we at CNN and others reporting that almost half of the 30,000 bombs [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=209.16s)]
*  that have been dropped on Gaza have been so-called dumb bombs, imprecise. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  If there was a real intent to protect civilians, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=219.72s)]
*  wouldn't they be using much more precise, smaller munitions? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  So first, I really appreciate the question on the phases of the conflict, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=225.4s)]
*  because I think there's been some misunderstanding in the reporting, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=230.08s)]
*  not from you, but from others. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=234.24s)]
*  When Israel launched this campaign to root out the terrorist threat [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=237.0s)]
*  that Hamas poses to the state of Israel, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=241.72s)]
*  it made clear from the beginning that this war would proceed in phases. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  We are now in the middle of a high intensity phase [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=247.36s)]
*  with ongoing ground operations, military operations [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  in both the northern half and the southern half of Gaza. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=254.32s)]
*  But there will be a transition to another phase of this war, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=257.32s)]
*  one that is focused in more precise ways on targeting the leadership [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=262.32s)]
*  and on intelligence-driven operations that continues to deal [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=266.32s)]
*  with the ongoing threat that Hamas poses. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  The conditions and the timing for that was obviously a subject of conversation [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  that I had with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with the War Cabinet, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=278.52s)]
*  with the leadership of the IDF, with the Defense Minister. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think it's really important that those conversations take place, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=286.92s)]
*  first, in the spirit of partnership. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=289.92s)]
*  We're not here to tell anybody, you must do X, you must do Y. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=291.32s)]
*  We're here to say, this is our perspective as your partner, as your friend. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=294.52s)]
*  This is what we believe is the best way to achieve [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=298.52s)]
*  both your tactical and strategic goals. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  And then second, it has to take place in private, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=302.92s)]
*  because we can't telegraph for the enemy what the plan is. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=305.12s)]
*  So I'm not going to speak to timelines, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=308.52s)]
*  and I'm not going to speak to conditions here from the podium. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=311.52s)]
*  What I am going to say is that we had a very constructive conversation yesterday [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=314.12s)]
*  about the transition from the high-intensity phase forward, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=318.12s)]
*  and we expect that that will occur in the future. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=322.12s)]
*  When exactly that happens and under exactly what conditions [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=325.32s)]
*  will be a continuing, intensive discussion between the United States and Israel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  And I will make sure that that conversation, at least as far as I can do it, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=332.52s)]
*  is going to take place behind closed doors. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  When it comes to the issue of the bombs, the type of bombs that Israel is using, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=341.52s)]
*  what I would say is that different types of munitions [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=347.52s)]
*  require different types of military operations, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=351.12s)]
*  meaning the method by which bombs are delivered [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=354.52s)]
*  that don't have the tail kits on them is different [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  in terms of how the planes fly, in terms of how the targets are selected. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=361.12s)]
*  And they all go through the same process, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  a process by which Israel selects targets and tries to distinguish between [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=367.12s)]
*  targets that hit Hamas and those that might take the lives of innocent civilians. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=374.72s)]
*  At the end of the day, what we have consistently said is that [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=380.32s)]
*  Israel has the intent to make sure that it is drawing those distinctions clearly [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=383.12s)]
*  and in a sustainable way, and we want to see the results match up to that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=389.92s)]
*  That's a conversation that I had in full with them today and yesterday as well, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=393.52s)]
*  and will continue to do that, including on the type of munitions they use [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  and when they use a certain type of munitions, how those are delivered [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=402.52s)]
*  to ensure that from the United States' perspective, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=406.52s)]
*  they are fulfilling their obligations, their responsibilities [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=410.32s)]
*  as a state to international humanitarian law. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzmRMgqWLiI&t=413.71999999999997s)]
