# Explosion interrupts live Gaza interview
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI)
*  Israel's military launched a new wave of airstrikes on the region Thursday morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=0.0s)]
*  The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 1,200 people have been killed and nearly [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=4.44s)]
*  6,000 wounded by Israeli bombardment. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=8.36s)]
*  The Health Ministry says it expects hospitals to run out of fuel for generators today, leading [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=11.08s)]
*  to what it calls catastrophic conditions. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=16.16s)]
*  Joining us now is Naila Shrawa, Oxfam Regional Country Relations Manager in Gaza City. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=19.28s)]
*  Naila, thank you so much for sparing this time to speak to us. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=25.88s)]
*  I know that yesterday or certainly earlier this week Oxfam was warning that what's happening [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=29.8s)]
*  in Gaza would lead to a humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=34.4s)]
*  Would you say that's already begun? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=36.92s)]
*  Yes, hi. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=38.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me, first of all. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=41.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's very obvious that the crisis is increasing rapidly and there is a severe [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=43.84s)]
*  impact on the population of Gaza, the entire population of Gaza. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=52.92s)]
*  The numbers of displaced people has been increasing, reaching to around 200-plus thousand people [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=57.28s)]
*  within the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  I know most of them are in Andorra, in UN-administered schools, trying to take shelters there. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  We are extremely worried because of the tightening of the Israeli siege. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=76.4s)]
*  We have to be aware that the Israeli siege has been there for more than 15 years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=82.16s)]
*  And so when you ask me about electricity, we never had a full day of electricity since [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=87.44s)]
*  more than 15, 16 years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=92.6s)]
*  Now we have zero electricity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=95.16s)]
*  Before at the best times we had eight. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=97.2s)]
*  And that's just an example, eight hours. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=99.0s)]
*  I mean, currently we are extremely worried about the infrastructure that is responsible [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=101.0s)]
*  for delivering basic services such as water. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=107.8s)]
*  So electricity affects water directly in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=110.8s)]
*  There is no ability to pump water to the networks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=116.8s)]
*  That's also in addition to the severe damages that is not yet clear, the extent of it, but [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=120.8s)]
*  apparently it's going to be very, very grave. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=128.8s)]
*  I think what is also mostly important to know that Gaza is already suffering before [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=133.8s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=140.8s)]
*  Before October 7th, you had half of the population under poverty. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=141.8s)]
*  You are living in a situation where there is no economic viability of any activity. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=146.8s)]
*  Israel has full control about on export and import. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=153.8s)]
*  Israel conducts regular attacks and that affects different livelihood groups. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=157.8s)]
*  Within the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=162.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=164.8s)]
*  So just in terms of your immediate concerns, obviously, Secretary Blinken is trying to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=165.8s)]
*  organise a humanitarian corridor. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=170.8s)]
*  That's going to be very difficult to negotiate right now, isn't it, with the Israelis because [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=172.8s)]
*  they're talking about a complete siege. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=176.8s)]
*  But what is the most important thing that you need right now just to get through the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=179.8s)]
*  next few days? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=183.8s)]
*  What is really needed immediately is to have a ceasefire to allow people of Gaza to receive [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=186.8s)]
*  support and basic services to at least for paramedics to be able to have some work around [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=196.8s)]
*  their hospitals. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=204.8s)]
*  Hospitals are packed with injuries. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=206.8s)]
*  There are still injuries that are everywhere. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=209.8s)]
*  There is no accessibility to organisations on the ground to deliver support. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=213.8s)]
*  There's no ability for us, the population, to move and get what we need or get the water [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=220.8s)]
*  that we need or the food that we need. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=230.8s)]
*  We need immediate ceasefires so that we are able also to support those who are under these [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=232.8s)]
*  very harsh circumstances, especially who are taking shelters at the schools and who are [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=242.8s)]
*  being hosted in just very random places and public places around the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=249.8s)]
*  Everyone I know personally is not living in their home. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=255.8s)]
*  Everyone I know is moving from one place to another, from a public place to another home, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=259.8s)]
*  to a relative, et cetera. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=266.8s)]
*  This must be stopped and I think it's going to be very worrying in terms of supplies, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=268.8s)]
*  food supplies, entry of medical supplies, all these essential items. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=273.8s)]
*  I mean, by the hour there is severe suffering in addition to the actual death in the hospitals [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=280.8s)]
*  themselves that are overloaded with injuries and casualties from the bombings. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=290.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=298.8s)]
*  Please don't continue this interview if you feel like you need to go somewhere else for your safety, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=300.8s)]
*  Najla. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=305.8s)]
*  Do you need to leave? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=307.8s)]
*  No, I think it's fine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=309.8s)]
*  Is that what it's like all the time? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=311.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, exactly. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=315.8s)]
*  Just this morning there was a massive airstrike at Al-Shateq camp and it's extremely shocking, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=318.8s)]
*  the images, and I hope these images will make news at your channel, for example, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=325.8s)]
*  where it seems there's a huge massacre. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=333.8s)]
*  It's a densely populated area where just bodies are under rubble. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=336.8s)]
*  I mean, I think the situation is extremely critical and negotiating safe passage. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=341.8s)]
*  I'm not sure if this is going to be just to evacuate foreigners or who. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=348.8s)]
*  I mean, this does not really respond to what people would need. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=354.8s)]
*  Of course, it's an interest of, you know, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=358.8s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you about, you know, you've just had that, you know, it was obviously a very close explosion [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=362.8s)]
*  and you just sat there and carried on with the interview. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=367.8s)]
*  Whereas, you know, what a lot of people watching would assume you would run off and go to some safe space. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=370.8s)]
*  But is it because you just haven't got anywhere to go and you're just so used to it? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=378.8s)]
*  We don't have shelters. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you for raising this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=381.8s)]
*  I mean, in the entire Gaza Strip, I mean, we don't have shelters. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=385.8s)]
*  I mean, the best circumstances is that you go to a lower level, you know. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=389.8s)]
*  I'm very lucky I have a basement where that's why I'm receiving more than 12 people in addition to my family [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=394.8s)]
*  who are all now I'm hosting at my place. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=401.8s)]
*  And so they are unable to go back to their homes because they are severely damaged in the area [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=404.8s)]
*  that was white and we're managing to live together. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=410.8s)]
*  So whenever there is something, you know, kind of close or big like this, we just, you know, walk around in the corridors [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=415.8s)]
*  and then slowly, slowly go to the lower level, et cetera. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=423.8s)]
*  And we stick around each other. And that's what happened at five a.m. this morning, for example, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=426.8s)]
*  when massive airstrikes were happening near the Gaza port and the west at the western side of the city. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=430.8s)]
*  Just across across the street from me, there was the building that was totally destroyed. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=438.8s)]
*  We had to evacuate. We we left running basically with in the middle of the night after one a.m. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=444.8s)]
*  two nights ago. And all of us, we were 20 at my house, 20, 20, 22 people who fled their region came to us. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=451.8s)]
*  Then we moved all of us to two different. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=463.8s)]
*  We split into two different places. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=466.8s)]
*  I mean, you were talking about a mad situation here, a totally mad situation. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=469.8s)]
*  Now, I should thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=476.8s)]
*  Obviously, your priority is to help these people and these civilians. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=479.8s)]
*  But this is obviously this is your life as well. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=483.8s)]
*  And we've seen that express. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=486.8s)]
*  So obviously today, best of luck with what you're doing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=488.8s)]
*  And thank you for making the time. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=491.8s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for having me. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvpifAzCMCI&t=494.8s)]
