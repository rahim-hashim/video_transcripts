# Father of 8-year-old girl believed to be taken by Hamas describes relentless search for daughter
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ)
*  Well, President Biden is expressing optimism about a potential deal to free some of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=0.0s)]
*  hostages held by Hamas, telling reporters yesterday he believes it's, quote, going to happen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=5.68s)]
*  Families of the Americans believed to be held hostage will meet with officials at the State [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  Department and on Capitol Hill today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=13.92s)]
*  That comes after thousands of demonstrators filled the National Mall yesterday in the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  march for Israel, many of them showing support for those hostages. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=20.96s)]
*  Now, the family of eight-year-old Emily Hand, they are anxiously awaiting news. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=24.04s)]
*  Emily, see her there, was initially believed to have been killed during the October 7th [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  Hamas attacks, but is now believed to be among the 239 hostages. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=31.88s)]
*  Before learning that his daughter was alive, Emily's father memorably, painfully told CNN's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=36.36s)]
*  Clarissa Ward that her death was a better alternative than being held captive by Hamas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=41.12s)]
*  That was the best possibly that I was hoping for. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=50.76s)]
*  She was either dead or in Gaza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=54.44s)]
*  And if you know anything about what they do to people in Gaza, that is worse than death. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=60.12s)]
*  Emily's father was planning to bury his daughter alongside her mother, who died from cancer [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=66.44s)]
*  several years ago, and now he is waiting for a chance to hug his beautiful little girl. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=72.4s)]
*  Emily turns nine this Friday. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=78.16s)]
*  She won't even know what day it is. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=82.16s)]
*  She won't know what day it is. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=84.16s)]
*  She won't know it's her birthday. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=86.16s)]
*  There will be no birthday cake, no party, no friends. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=88.16s)]
*  She'll just be petrified in a tunnel under Gaza, and that's her birthday. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=93.16s)]
*  Emily's father, Thomas Hand, is with us now. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=100.16s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=104.16s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=105.16s)]
*  We have been watching you, grieving with you, hoping for you, and now you are here in the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=106.16s)]
*  fight of your life for your daughter, who turns nine on Friday. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=113.16s)]
*  Tell us about that fight. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=118.16s)]
*  And we've been working nonstop to put pressure on all the governments all over the world [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=121.16s)]
*  to do their best to get particularly my little Emily back home. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=130.16s)]
*  She's an Irish citizen, so we put a lot of pressure on the Irish government to get her back. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=137.16s)]
*  We're doing everything that we possibly can to get her home and all the hostages, at least the children. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=144.16s)]
*  They could start off with the babies and the children. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=153.16s)]
*  They've got babies being kidnapped over there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=155.16s)]
*  Poppy makes, I think, such a silly point. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=161.16s)]
*  All of us were very shaken when we watched your interview with Carissa Ward, I think, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=165.16s)]
*  and then we kind of rode the rollercoaster with you, obviously to a significantly less degree, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=170.16s)]
*  when we saw your interview with Ed Lavandera, where things had changed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=174.16s)]
*  What has been the response to you? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=178.16s)]
*  I can't imagine how painful and difficult it is to have to come out and talk about this, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=181.16s)]
*  but I also imagine the support for what you've been saying has been tremendous. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=185.16s)]
*  The support worldwide is tremendous. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=191.16s)]
*  I've got people in Brazil sending me messages of comfort and support. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=198.16s)]
*  Yeah, the campaign is viral, I suppose you'd call it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=206.16s)]
*  It's been great, the support that we're being given. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=212.16s)]
*  In the last 24 hours, President Biden had a lengthy call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=217.16s)]
*  and President Biden came out of that call and said he believes it's, quote, going to happen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=223.16s)]
*  Does that give you more hope that they're going to get out? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=228.16s)]
*  Of course. America has a lot of influence all over the world. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=231.16s)]
*  If he says that, obviously he knows more than I do. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=237.16s)]
*  Every little bit of information gives us hope that we can get Emily [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=242.16s)]
*  and at least the children and babies out of Gaza. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=248.16s)]
*  How often are you getting information, either from the Irish officials, the US officials? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=255.16s)]
*  Very, very little. Nobody really knows anything. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=259.16s)]
*  I know for a fact that she's not dead. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=264.16s)]
*  I know for a fact that she was led away by the Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=269.16s)]
*  There's eyewitness accounts of it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=275.16s)]
*  Someone saw her being led away. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=280.16s)]
*  Her and her friend and her friend's mother. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=283.16s)]
*  Can I ask you, say I know for a fact, and that is the reporting, but do you also feel it? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=289.16s)]
*  You know, parents feel something with their children that is in a bond like no other. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=295.16s)]
*  Can you feel, Emily? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=300.16s)]
*  No. No. My feelings... [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=302.16s)]
*  I can't let my feelings interfere with getting her back. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=310.16s)]
*  It's like a campaign. We just keep moving forward. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=315.16s)]
*  I don't even see the interviews. I don't have time to look at the interviews. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=320.16s)]
*  I don't watch the news. I haven't got time for it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=324.16s)]
*  It's just full on, get Emily back. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=327.16s)]
*  And to that point, part of that is going to happen in Times Square, right here in the middle of New York, right? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=331.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=336.16s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=337.16s)]
*  Big billboards of, I guess for sure, Emily. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=338.16s)]
*  And marching on from there, just to keep Emily... [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=348.16s)]
*  Just to keep her alive in people's minds and hearts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=356.16s)]
*  We mentioned, and you've spoken about her birthday on Friday, the billboards. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=360.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=365.16s)]
*  Driving and not being able to stop and think. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=366.16s)]
*  How much of that is because you have a goal here, because you have a true purpose in North Star, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=369.16s)]
*  and how much of that is because you don't want to stop and think about what's going on right now? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=374.16s)]
*  Yeah. I can't. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=380.16s)]
*  I actually keep her in a special place. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=383.16s)]
*  I don't want to imagine what she's going through every day for 38 days now. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=387.16s)]
*  I can't think about it. It would be too painful. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=396.16s)]
*  You know, she's down in the tunnels of Gaza with the Hamas. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=404.16s)]
*  I don't want to think of what conditions she's in, how she's being treated, how she's being fed, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=411.16s)]
*  how she's being given water, and just how she got toothbrush and toothpaste, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=420.16s)]
*  toilet facilities. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=431.16s)]
*  You know, these are tunnels underneath Gaza. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=433.16s)]
*  Could be like the train carts in Second World War. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=436.16s)]
*  They were just all in a cattle car and pee and poo where you stood. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=443.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=451.16s)]
*  I know you have said when you get her back, you'll take her to Disney World, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=453.16s)]
*  and you will give her the best of the best. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=458.16s)]
*  You have said when you get her back, you will take her to Disney World, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=461.16s)]
*  and you will give her the world, and she is so lucky to have you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=465.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=469.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=471.16s)]
*  I'm not going to send her to school for at least a year. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=472.16s)]
*  We're going to give her the world, just happy times, and fix her. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=478.16s)]
*  You know, she's not going to come back. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=487.16s)]
*  None of them are going to come back the way they went in. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=489.16s)]
*  They're going to be mentally and physically and emotionally broken, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=494.16s)]
*  and that's going to take a lot of time and energy to fix her, but we'll do it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=501.16s)]
*  We'll do everything we can to fix her. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=511.16s)]
*  We hope and pray for that moment when you get to give her the world, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=514.16s)]
*  anything you need or we can do to continue to get the message out. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=519.16s)]
*  Please just let us know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=524.16s)]
*  We're very grateful for your time. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=525.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbjTW0J1LQ&t=527.16s)]
