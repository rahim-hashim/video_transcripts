*  You recently met with families of hostages [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=0.0s)]
*  still being held in Gaza. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=2.56s)]
*  More than 100 hostages are believed to still be alive, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=4.04s)]
*  including six Americans. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  A lot of the hostage families with whom I've spoken [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  are pretty critical of the Netanyahu government. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=11.4s)]
*  They say they don't think Netanyahu is doing enough [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=13.24s)]
*  to get their loved ones out, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=16.28s)]
*  that he's prioritized military operations [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=17.6s)]
*  instead of getting the hostages back safely. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Is that what they told you? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=24.76s)]
*  Well, what I heard from not only families of hostages, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=27.12s)]
*  but as we walked the streets of Kfar Aza, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=33.32s)]
*  Khabutza was literally decimated [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=37.32s)]
*  by the Hamas terrorist invasion on October 7th, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  was deep grief, but also a determination [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=43.8s)]
*  to move their nation forward and to restore their security. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=48.72s)]
*  I mean, you know, it was remarkable to see [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=52.04s)]
*  the resilience of the people and the families [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=55.68s)]
*  that had lost loved ones, the families of hostages. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=59.2s)]
*  And one understands their impatience. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=61.6s)]
*  And, you know, I have three kids of my own, two grandkids. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=64.68s)]
*  I can't even imagine the level of grief [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  that they're experiencing and the struggle. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=70.2s)]
*  But I must tell you that I have never spent three days [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=73.0s)]
*  on the road in any capacity, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=77.44s)]
*  whether it was on as vice president [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=80.2s)]
*  or as a member of Congress, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  where I have felt greater heartbreak [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  and greater inspiration in combination. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=85.72s)]
*  When we went to the South and we visited the Khabutza [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=88.2s)]
*  where the Hamas terrorists literally slaughtered families [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=91.16s)]
*  in a merciless and horrific way, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=93.96s)]
*  I just never thought I'd see the aftermath of war like that, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=96.24s)]
*  and literally an unspeakable evil. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=100.92s)]
*  But to see the resilience of the people of Israel [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=102.96s)]
*  to be among the troops along the northern border [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=106.6s)]
*  with Lebanon left me deeply inspired, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=110.92s)]
*  but more convinced than ever that the United States [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=113.2s)]
*  of America must in this moment stand clearly [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=115.92s)]
*  shoulder to shoulder with Israel until they hunt down [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=120.44000000000001s)]
*  and destroy the threat of Hamas once and for all. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=123.48s)]
*  So you have said that Israel has the right to respond [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=126.04s)]
*  to those horrific attacks of October 7th [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=128.68s)]
*  and the responsibility to destroy Hamas as you just did. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=131.04000000000002s)]
*  But it does seem that the IDF strikes [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  have killed more Palestinian civilians [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=135.72s)]
*  than they have members of Hamas. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=137.76s)]
*  And there are Israelis who are worried [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=139.28s)]
*  about the high civilian death toll in Gaza, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=142.12s)]
*  including for the reason that this high civilian death toll [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=144.52s)]
*  might actually ultimately make Israel less safe [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=148.52s)]
*  by inspiring more future terrorists. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=151.28s)]
*  Do you share any of those concerns? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=154.12s)]
*  Well, first, Jake, look, I grieve the loss [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=158.0s)]
*  of innocent civilian lives. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=160.2s)]
*  But one of the things I learned as we visited Sderot [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=163.4s)]
*  where the terrorists literally took over the police station [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=166.6s)]
*  and murdered people in the streets [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=169.36s)]
*  is that this was not simply a terrorist attack, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=173.32s)]
*  but I believe it was a terrorist invasion. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, what I learned in our briefings in the South [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=180.28s)]
*  was that that fence line separating Israel from Gaza [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  was breached in more than 90 different places [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=187.8s)]
*  simultaneously paving the way [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=191.28s)]
*  for some 3,000 terrorists heavily armed [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=194.48s)]
*  to move into Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=198.11999999999998s)]
*  And in fact, the briefings I received pointed out [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  that actually the terrorists had sufficient armaments [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=202.44s)]
*  and supplies to literally march all the way here to Tel Aviv, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=207.0s)]
*  all the way to Jerusalem. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=210.6s)]
*  But for the heroic efforts of police, IDF forces, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=211.92s)]
*  and frankly, courageous citizens, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=216.76s)]
*  they were stopped from doing that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=219.0s)]
*  So I really believe that what Israel is doing in Gaza today [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  is absolutely essential. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=224.28s)]
*  It is a response to an invasion that was launched [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=225.88s)]
*  with the intention of beginning the process [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=229.8s)]
*  of destroying the Jewish state of Israel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=232.04s)]
*  And I really do believe that this is a moment [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=234.68s)]
*  where America needs to speak with one voice, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=238.36s)]
*  that we will stand with Israel today and tomorrow [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=242.24s)]
*  and every day until they have won outright this fight [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=244.88s)]
*  and eliminated the threat of Hamas. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=247.88s)]
*  We learned late Friday night [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=250.28s)]
*  that the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=251.72s)]
*  spent multiple days this past week in the hospital, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=254.24s)]
*  including time in the intensive care unit [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=257.72s)]
*  for a medical issue that is still undisclosed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=260.04s)]
*  He did this without the public, without Congress, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=262.68s)]
*  without the National Security Council, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=265.64s)]
*  or even President Biden being informed for several days. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=267.6s)]
*  The defense secretary temporarily assumed some of, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=271.08s)]
*  the deputy defense secretary temporarily assumed [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=273.24s)]
*  some of the responsibilities [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  while she was on vacation in Puerto Rico. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=276.44s)]
*  As a former vice president, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=279.0s)]
*  you have a unique insight as to what this actually means [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=280.67999999999995s)]
*  for a secretary of defense to be unavailable [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  and to not be transparent with his boss about his health. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, first, I wish the secretary of defense well [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  and pleased he's making a full recovery, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=297.2s)]
*  but the handling of this by the secretary of defense [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  is totally unacceptable. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=304.52s)]
*  And I believe the American people have a right to know [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  about his medical condition, about the reasons for it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=311.32s)]
*  And he has a right to know who was informed [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  of his incapacity. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=319.79999999999995s)]
*  And I mean, but to think that at a time [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  when we have allies at war in Eastern Europe [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=325.52s)]
*  and here in Israel, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  that the leader of America's military at the Pentagon [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  would be out of commission for a number of days. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=335.12s)]
*  And the president of the United States didn't know about it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=338.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it was a dereliction of duty [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=340.84s)]
*  and the secretary and the administration, frankly, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  need to step forward and give the American people the facts. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=347.88s)]
*  Yeah, we still don't even know what he was hospitalized for. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=351.36s)]
*  Yesterday marked the third anniversary [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=354.24s)]
*  of the January 6th attack on the Capitol. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=356.64s)]
*  A Washington Post poll this week found that a third [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=359.08s)]
*  of Republicans believe the falsehood [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=361.71999999999997s)]
*  that it's probably or definitely true [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  that the FBI instigated the attack on the Capitol [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=365.15999999999997s)]
*  on January 6th. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=367.48s)]
*  President Trump was spreading that lie just this weekend, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=368.68s)]
*  falsely claiming the FBI was quote, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=371.52s)]
*  leading the charge on January 6th. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=373.12s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=374.76s)]
*  Obviously your life, the lives of your family members [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=375.96s)]
*  were threatened that day. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=378.4s)]
*  What do you say to those, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=379.44s)]
*  including your former running mate, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=380.91999999999996s)]
*  who are actively spreading this baseless lie [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=383.0s)]
*  or maybe even more importantly, to those who believe it? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I would say to every American, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=390.2s)]
*  as I did during my presidential campaign, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  that I know I did my duty that day [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=397.48s)]
*  to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=399.92s)]
*  I kept my oath. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=403.16s)]
*  And they also simply need to look to the facts [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=404.76s)]
*  that the Capitol Hill police endured great hardship [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=408.64s)]
*  and great harm. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=414.08s)]
*  I think over 120 officers were injured. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=415.04s)]
*  I saw many of them moving through the garage [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=418.64s)]
*  where I was spirited on the same day. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=421.76s)]
*  And the truth is that this was a riot [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=424.76s)]
*  that should never have happened. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=430.4s)]
*  That as I've said many times before, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=433.12s)]
*  the former president's words that day were reckless. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=436.24s)]
*  I believe his history will judge his role in that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=439.24s)]
*  But at the end of the day, where I live every day, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=443.52s)]
*  and frankly, the words of encouragement [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=446.28s)]
*  that I receive on a regular basis, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=449.28s)]
*  as I know by God's grace, we did our duty that day, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=450.84s)]
*  three years ago. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=454.24s)]
*  But I will tell you, Jake, that I actually, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=455.16s)]
*  I understand why President Biden wants to focus [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=459.04s)]
*  his campaign on three years ago. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=461.72s)]
*  The record of this administration has weakened America [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=463.8s)]
*  at home and abroad. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=466.92s)]
*  And I actually don't think the election's going [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=469.16s)]
*  to be decided on a tragic day three years ago. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=472.8s)]
*  I think it's gonna be decided on the failed policies [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=476.24s)]
*  of the Biden administration that have emboldened [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=479.0s)]
*  the enemies of freedom around the world, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=482.12s)]
*  that launched the worst inflation, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=484.68s)]
*  that created the worst crisis on our border [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=485.52s)]
*  in American history. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=488.23999999999995s)]
*  And it's one of the reasons why I continue to hope [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=489.44s)]
*  that with the Iowa caucuses, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=492.47999999999996s)]
*  New Hampshire just around the corner, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=494.32s)]
*  that all the good Republican voters in those states [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  will give our party a fresh start [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=499.76s)]
*  and give us new leadership to lead our party forward [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=502.2s)]
*  in the election and beyond. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  Is there somebody other than Donald Trump [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=507.52s)]
*  that you want the voters of Iowa to get behind? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=509.67999999999995s)]
*  Is there somebody you prefer, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=512.4s)]
*  whether it's Governor DeSantis or Ambassador Haley? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=513.52s)]
*  You are somebody whose endorsement could actually [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=517.16s)]
*  make a difference with any wavering Republicans [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=521.84s)]
*  who want a fresh start, as you note. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=524.0s)]
*  Well, I've been speaking to several of my old competitors, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=528.28s)]
*  I think very highly, of Nikki Haley, of Ron DeSantis, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  and frankly, Chris Christie's been a friend for many years. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=536.04s)]
*  And I don't put a lot of stock in endorsements. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=539.04s)]
*  I'm not sure whether I'm gonna weigh in [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=541.76s)]
*  or if and when I will. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=543.4s)]
*  But I ran for president because I think different times [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=545.5600000000001s)]
*  call for different leadership, Jake. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=548.4s)]
*  And I'm hoping that the good people of Iowa [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=549.88s)]
*  that I got to know so well in my campaign, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=553.44s)]
*  the good people of New Hampshire and South Carolina, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  will look at this moment and recognize [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=559.52s)]
*  that elections are about the future [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=562.0s)]
*  and we need new leadership in the Republican Party. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=564.1600000000001s)]
*  We certainly need new leadership in the White House [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=567.0s)]
*  to move us forward. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  And if I see an opportunity to have an impact [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=570.5999999999999s)]
*  on achieving that, I'll certainly do it [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=572.92s)]
*  and I'll keep you posted. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not just President Biden who's focusing [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=576.8399999999999s)]
*  on January 6th, of course, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=579.04s)]
*  you have Donald Trump still talking about it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  Do you wanna just like take this opportunity [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=582.7199999999999s)]
*  to clear up this lie that the FBI was leading the charge [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=584.4s)]
*  on January 6th? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=587.4799999999999s)]
*  It's obviously not true. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=588.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you know it's not true. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=589.92s)]
*  Do you wanna make that clear to the voters? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=591.4799999999999s)]
*  You know, I've seen the director of the FBI [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=595.52s)]
*  repeatedly assure the American people [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=598.36s)]
*  that the FBI were not the instigators of the riot [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  that occurred on January 6th. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  And frankly, I'm very grateful for the efforts of the FBI [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=606.88s)]
*  to bring nearly a thousand people to justice [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=611.36s)]
*  who ransacked our Capitol and did violence [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=613.88s)]
*  against police officers that day. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=616.84s)]
*  But you're right, we've been assured again and again [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=619.36s)]
*  that it was not the case. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=623.48s)]
*  And I just must tell you, having been there that day, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=625.28s)]
*  to see people literally breaking windows, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=629.08s)]
*  ransacking the Capitol, it just infuriated me. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=631.36s)]
*  I remember thinking, you know, not this, not here, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=636.28s)]
*  not at the United States Capitol. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=640.52s)]
*  And I believe everyone that conducted that riot [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  at the Capitol needs to be held to the fullest extent [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=646.72s)]
*  of the law, I'm pleased that many have. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=649.04s)]
*  But I've never been given any information. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  I've heard the many repeated assurances from the FBI [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=654.76s)]
*  that they were not involved, and I take them at their word. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHTCH1nA-eQ&t=657.92s)]
