# Video shows helicopter rescue of Israeli hostages
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4)
*  We begin with breaking news out of the Middle East as Israel welcomes home four hostages [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=0.0s)]
*  rescued this morning from Gaza during a special military operation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=5.44s)]
*  All four kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova Music Festival during the October 7 attacks [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  eight months ago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=15.48s)]
*  And they include 22-year-old Almag Mayor Jean, 25-year-old Noah Argumani, 27-year-old [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=17.16s)]
*  Andre Kozlov, and 41-year-old Shlomi Zeev. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=23.92s)]
*  Andre and Shlomi were working as security guards at the music festival. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  And you may remember Noah Argumani from this horrific video from the October 7 attacks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  We all saw her screaming as Hamas fighters drove away with her on a motorbike. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=39.16s)]
*  We know her boyfriend was also kidnapped and is still being held captive. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=43.84s)]
*  Israel says this morning's rescue mission took place at two separate locations in central [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=48.76s)]
*  Gaza near a refugee camp. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=52.72s)]
*  Palestinians there described the raid as hell on earth as heavy shelling and artillery fire [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=54.8s)]
*  bombarded that area. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=60.32s)]
*  Officials in Gaza say at least 210 people have been killed, more than 400 injured, including [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=62.76s)]
*  women and children. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  But CNN cannot independently verify those numbers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=70.4s)]
*  We are covering these breaking developments from all angles. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=74.0s)]
*  Ben Wiedemann has more on the casualties inside Gaza. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=76.88s)]
*  But first we start with Paula Hancocks in Tel Aviv, who has more details on the surprise [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=79.68s)]
*  rescue mission that brought these four hostages home. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=85.36000000000001s)]
*  Paula, how are these hostages doing? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=88.44000000000001s)]
*  Well Jessica, what we've been told from the doctor at the medical center they were all [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=93.12s)]
*  taken to once they were rescued is that they are all stable, they are in good medical condition. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=97.68s)]
*  And just outside that hospital we have seen all day friends and family coming to welcome [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=105.56s)]
*  home their loved ones that have been in captivity for the past eight months. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=112.0s)]
*  Now many of them have thanked the military for the mission, they have thanked those that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  were part of this rescue operation, but they have also said that there are 120 more hostages [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  that need to be rescued. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=133.12s)]
*  Now we did hear from the mother of one of the hostages, Almogh Mea Jan, and let's listen [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=135.44s)]
*  to what she said. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=142.26s)]
*  Thank you for bringing my son to me, to us. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=145.08s)]
*  I'm so excited that I could hug him today. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=153.28s)]
*  I couldn't stop hugging him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=159.36s)]
*  I couldn't stop. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  And tomorrow is my birthday, so I got my present. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=164.28s)]
*  Now she also said that they want a ceasefire deal to make sure the rest of the hostages [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=171.48s)]
*  can be released. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=176.6s)]
*  It's something we've heard here tonight in Tel Aviv where the weekly protest has been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=177.78s)]
*  held. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  We heard from one of the women speaking, her cousin is one of those who has died in captivity, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  still being held by her mass, saying not everything will have a Hollywood ending. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=190.52s)]
*  So there's a real push at the same time as celebrating the rescue of these four hostages, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=194.96s)]
*  a push for a ceasefire and hostage deal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=200.4s)]
*  Jessica? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=203.28s)]
*  And Paul, what more are you learning about the rescue mission itself? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=204.28s)]
*  This was high-stake stuff, how did it come together? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=207.54s)]
*  So what we're hearing from the IDF side is that the military, the security agency, the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=213.12s)]
*  police had a joint operation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=219.24s)]
*  They had been planning this for weeks. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=220.6s)]
*  They say it was based on intelligence. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=222.96s)]
*  And it was just on Thursday night that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=225.24s)]
*  gave the green light to go ahead with this mission. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=228.88s)]
*  They said they effectively built two apartment blocks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=232.08s)]
*  They knew that these civilians, excuse me, hostages were being held in civilian multi-story [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  buildings and they built blocks so that they could train in how to try and extract them [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=242.72s)]
*  from that area. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=247.28s)]
*  Now, they have pointed out it wasn't a civilian area and that many of the other hostages would [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=249.16s)]
*  not be held in a similar situation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=253.4s)]
*  So they don't believe that this could be necessarily replicated after this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=256.48s)]
*  Jessica? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=260.24s)]
*  All right, Pauline Hancock for us live in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=261.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=263.76s)]
*  Let's turn now to the impact in Gaza, where Palestinians are describing that special operation [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=264.76s)]
*  as hell on earth. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=269.08s)]
*  And I do want to warn you, some of the video we're about to show you is graphic. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=270.24s)]
*  CNN this about the aftermath of the attack. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=274.88s)]
*  Quote, there are children torn apart and scattered in the streets. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=277.88s)]
*  We turn now to Ben Wideman for more on the impact inside Gaza and Ben Hamas officials [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=281.44s)]
*  say there are more than 200 people dead, hundreds more injured. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=286.18s)]
*  We were just looking at some of that video. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=289.52s)]
*  What more do we know? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=291.08s)]
*  This is without a doubt one of the bloodiest Israeli assaults in this war so far. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=294.68s)]
*  Doctors at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Dar al-Bala say that the death toll at the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  moment stands at least at 410 with more than 400 injured. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=306.64s)]
*  Now CNN has a cameraman who got into that hospital and the scenes are utter pandemonium. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=313.32s)]
*  Women, children, wounded, dead all over this hospital. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=320.32s)]
*  The morgue is full, the dead are on the ground outside. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=326.48s)]
*  There are many relatives there trying to get treatment for their wounded loved ones. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=330.56s)]
*  Others are weeping and praying over the dead. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=337.56s)]
*  Now this assault took place mid-morning, just before noon actually, and at a time when many [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=340.8s)]
*  people are out and about. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=347.72s)]
*  There's a market in the Nusayrat camp where this happened. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=349.44s)]
*  Lots of people were in the street. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=353.32s)]
*  And what we've seen video coming out of that place is that the Israelis used a lot of heavy [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=355.96000000000004s)]
*  firepower in that area where there were many civilians walking around. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=361.24s)]
*  So certainly this is a success for the Israelis, but for the Palestinians it comes at a very [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=368.68s)]
*  high price. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=375.8s)]
*  And it's worth mentioning that the Israelis in military operations going back to October [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=377.04s)]
*  have managed at this point to free seven hostages. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=382.92s)]
*  However, 105 hostages were released during a ceasefire back in late November in which [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=386.82s)]
*  81 Israeli hostages were freed as well as 24 foreign nationals. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=394.82000000000005s)]
*  So it's clear that after eight months of war and a death toll of over 36,000 in Gaza, that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=401.46000000000004s)]
*  the best way to get people out, the hostages free, is not through dramatic military action, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=408.46s)]
*  but it's through ceasefire. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=415.38s)]
*  Jessica? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=417.02s)]
*  And then Secretary of State Antony Blinken is traveling to the Middle East to push for [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=418.02s)]
*  a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=422.08s)]
*  What is the word at this point on how this rescue mission may potentially impact those [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=426.26s)]
*  discussions? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=432.62s)]
*  Well, we've seen a statement from spokesman for Hamas indicating that this might make [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  things more difficult, but there already it seems that even though President Biden came [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  out on the 31st of May coming up with a three-point proposal to try to end this war, both sides [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=446.56s)]
*  have been ambiguous. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=454.14s)]
*  The Israelis have indicated sort of a willingness to go along with it, but Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=455.74s)]
*  has made it clear that his ultimate goal is the destruction of Hamas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=461.70000000000005s)]
*  Hamas wants Israel to agree to a complete and permanent ceasefire, so they still seem [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=466.5s)]
*  to be well apart. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=474.26000000000005s)]
*  The gap is wide between the two sides. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=477.02000000000004s)]
*  Now we know that William Burns, the head of the CIA, was in Qatar and Brett McGurk, the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=480.06s)]
*  Mideast coordinator for the White House, was in Cairo. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=485.98s)]
*  So the efforts are being made, but they don't seem to be bearing fruit until now. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=489.58s)]
*  Ben Wiedemann for us in Beirut. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=494.58s)]
*  Thank you so much for that reporting. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-RBT5KE_Z4&t=498.3s)]
