# Biden and Netanyahu to speak for the first time since 7 aid workers killed in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw)
*  Today, a phone call that could alter the course of a war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=0.0s)]
*  The planned phone call between President Biden [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=5.8s)]
*  This will be the first call between the two leaders [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=8.44s)]
*  since that tragic incident where seven aid workers [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=11.24s)]
*  were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza this week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  Top White House officials are telling CNN [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=18.52s)]
*  that Biden is both angry and outraged about it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=20.52s)]
*  This morning, the founder of World Central Kitchen, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=24.92s)]
*  the aid workers worked for, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=27.72s)]
*  Chef Jose Andres, is accusing Israel [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=29.24s)]
*  of systematically his word, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=32.28s)]
*  targeting the aid convoy car by car, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=34.12s)]
*  and he is calling for an independent investigation into it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=36.68s)]
*  This was not just a bad luck situation [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=41.68s)]
*  where oops, we dropped the bomb in the wrong place or not. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  What I know is that we were targeted deliberately, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  nonstop until everybody was dead in this convoy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=54.64s)]
*  CNN's Arlette Sines is at the White House [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=59.88s)]
*  with more for us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=61.92s)]
*  And Arlette, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=62.760000000000005s)]
*  who's very close to Joe Biden, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=64.8s)]
*  he was just on speaking to Sarah, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=66.52s)]
*  and he said this phone call he expects [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=67.84s)]
*  is going to be very important in the next step [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=69.76s)]
*  in the US-Israel relationship. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Kate, and President Biden is expected to convey [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=76.68s)]
*  his personal anger and frustration [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=79.56s)]
*  directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=81.84s)]
*  as they speak in the coming hours. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=85.44s)]
*  The Israeli strike that killed these seven aid workers [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=86.8s)]
*  with World Central Kitchen really marks [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=90.28s)]
*  the latest flashpoint in an increasingly tense relationship [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=92.32s)]
*  between Biden and Netanyahu, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  and many are questioning whether this moment [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=97.72s)]
*  could serve as a turning point in the US support for Israel [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=100.32s)]
*  as it conducts its campaign to root out Hamas in Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=104.92s)]
*  Now, the president has expressed his outrage [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=108.56s)]
*  about the incident. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  The frustration has been rising here at the White House. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=111.92s)]
*  The president is expected to focus on the death [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=114.72s)]
*  of those aid workers while also broadening out [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=116.8s)]
*  the conversation, trying to discuss ways to ensure [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=119.0s)]
*  that there are protections for humanitarian aid workers. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=121.92s)]
*  We have sources have told us that US officials [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=124.8s)]
*  have already started talking to the Israelis [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=127.0s)]
*  about the need to change the way that information [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=129.32s)]
*  is transmitted when it comes to the locations [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=131.8s)]
*  of aid workers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=134.56s)]
*  We also anticipate the president to talk about [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=135.96s)]
*  the ongoing hostage and humanitarian aid negotiations [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=138.32s)]
*  to try to get a temporary ceasefire, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=142.0s)]
*  as well as that operation that Israel's expected [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=143.84s)]
*  to wage in Ra'a. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=146.24s)]
*  Now, ahead of this call, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=147.8s)]
*  spoke with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Galant, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=150.96s)]
*  where a Pentagon spokesperson said [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=153.64s)]
*  that he conveyed his outrage while also saying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=155.64s)]
*  that this incident reinforces US concerns [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=158.16s)]
*  about needing to protect civilians [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=161.04s)]
*  in any type of operation that Israel conducts in Ra'a. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=163.0s)]
*  But even as we have seen this heightened rhetoric [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=166.4s)]
*  from the administration expressing anger and outrage, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=169.32s)]
*  what we have not seen yet is any shift in policy [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=172.24s)]
*  when it comes to the US approach to Israel, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=175.84s)]
*  especially when it comes to the US continuing [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=179.12s)]
*  to provide military support to Israel [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=182.16s)]
*  without any conditions. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  Officials here at the White House said that they are not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=186.16s)]
*  at that point where there is a shift in policy, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=188.12s)]
*  though a senior administration official says [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=190.4s)]
*  that there has been a shift in the frustrations [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=192.08s)]
*  from the president. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=194.76s)]
*  Now, this all comes as President Biden [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=195.64s)]
*  is also facing significant pressure here at home [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  when it comes to his handling of this conflict. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  He heard that directly from Muslim community leaders [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=202.67999999999998s)]
*  here at the White House on Tuesday, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=205.2s)]
*  but many are questioning whether this exact moment [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=207.04s)]
*  could serve as any turning point [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=210.16s)]
*  in the administration's strategy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=211.6s)]
*  As of now, it doesn't seem that they're changing [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  any pathway forward in the imminent future. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  All right, signs at the White House. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=219.72s)]
*  Thank you so much, Arlette. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  See you, Sarah. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=222.6s)]
*  All right, thank you, Kate. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  And Chief International Anchor, Christiane Amanpour [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=224.54s)]
*  is joining us now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=227.18s)]
*  Christiane, we just heard from Senator Coons, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=229.06s)]
*  who says there is a line and there should be conditions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=231.74s)]
*  And the president of the United States [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=235.26s)]
*  has been very frustrated, we know, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=237.22s)]
*  with Netanyahu and Israel's approach in Gaza at this point. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=239.74s)]
*  The pressure is really mounting on Israel [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=243.38s)]
*  from other close allies. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=245.5s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=247.02s)]
*  Well, precisely that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=249.66s)]
*  And really, in the United States, you'd have to go back [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=250.9s)]
*  as far as the first George H.W. Bush administration, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=253.46s)]
*  when they expressed public frustration and anger [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=257.54s)]
*  over different issues, the increasing building [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=260.3s)]
*  of settlements, and James Baker held out a phone number [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=262.62s)]
*  for the State Department to say, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=266.42s)]
*  "'When you're serious, give us a call. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=267.58s)]
*  "'You have the number.'" [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=269.5s)]
*  But what does this actually change, this mounting pressure? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=270.74s)]
*  As you heard from Arlette, it's unlikely to change [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=273.5s)]
*  any shift towards sending military aid to Israel, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=276.3s)]
*  but that is precisely what governments around the world, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=279.58s)]
*  and what Israel's allies are being asked to do, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  including here in the UK. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=284.66s)]
*  Defense Minister, former Prime Minister, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=287.42s)]
*  and Foreign Minister David Cameron has said [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  that he has demanded to his Israeli counterpart [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=292.02000000000004s)]
*  an immediate investigation into this appalling attack [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=294.74s)]
*  on aid workers, and he said, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  "'We want to see that happen very, very soon.'" [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=299.18s)]
*  The problem here is that all the allies say [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=301.98s)]
*  that Israel has a right to defend itself [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=304.86s)]
*  after what happened on October 7th, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=307.22s)]
*  but that it must act within the rules [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=309.74s)]
*  of the international road. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=313.09999999999997s)]
*  There are international laws that include not firing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=314.38s)]
*  on civilian convoys, and let's not forget, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=318.3s)]
*  this one, like the others, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=320.78s)]
*  were heavily coordinated with Israel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=322.02s)]
*  This is what the UN humanitarian chief told me [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=324.38s)]
*  about the World Central Kitchen assassinations [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=327.3s)]
*  or attacks on Monday. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=330.18s)]
*  Yes, it's a duty of care problem, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=334.86s)]
*  but it's also a legal problem. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=336.38s)]
*  Attacks on humanitarian institutions and workers [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=338.9s)]
*  is prohibited under international law. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=342.38s)]
*  So whether it's intentional or not, it's a crime, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=345.7s)]
*  and we must be very conscious of this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  As I say, it's been happening, as you know, Christiane, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=352.62s)]
*  to our colleagues from the outset. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=354.98s)]
*  And as you know, hundreds, nearly 200 UN [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=359.38s)]
*  and other aid workers have been killed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=363.54s)]
*  The vast majority of them Palestinians. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=364.94s)]
*  Sarah? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=367.82s)]
*  Yeah, it strikes me in your conversation [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=368.98s)]
*  that he said whether it's intentional or not, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=370.58s)]
*  it is still a crime. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=372.5s)]
*  What is the impression that Netanyahu [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  and his administration is giving to those [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=376.66s)]
*  who are calling for better treatment of civilians? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=380.66s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=384.06s)]
*  Well, look, it's really, really difficult to understand this. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=385.78s)]
*  Even former President Trump has told, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=388.58s)]
*  and you can see it on an Israeli website, Israel HaYom, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=391.3s)]
*  it's a right-wing website, they interviewed him earlier, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=394.18s)]
*  and even he said, you've gotta stop your war. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=397.02s)]
*  Yes, you could defend yourself, but you've gotta stop this. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=399.90000000000003s)]
*  You're losing your international credibility and support, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=402.26s)]
*  and we cannot keep seeing these bodies piling up in Gaza. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=405.22s)]
*  So this is really becoming, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=409.1s)]
*  Trump gave Netanyahu everything he wanted, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=410.94s)]
*  moving the consulate and the embassy to Jerusalem, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=413.74s)]
*  giving them sovereignty over the Golan Heights, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=416.18s)]
*  practically inviting them to annex the West Bank. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=418.74s)]
*  He was very much in Netanyahu's camp, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=421.06s)]
*  but right now, as I've said, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=424.18s)]
*  there's an increasing number of allied governments, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=427.02s)]
*  allies of Israel, who are looking at the very serious matter [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=429.78s)]
*  of continuing to send the massive weapons systems [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=433.78s)]
*  and the bombs, 2,000-ton bombs from the United States, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=437.5s)]
*  that are, or two-ton bombs that are being sent. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=441.41999999999996s)]
*  And again, here is Jose Andres [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=443.74s)]
*  on his conversation with President Biden. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=445.86s)]
*  I spoke to President Biden yesterday. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=450.3s)]
*  President Biden made a statement, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=452.58000000000004s)]
*  which seems it's already a harder stand, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=454.34000000000003s)]
*  but it's very complicated to understand [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=457.90000000000003s)]
*  that we are gonna be sending, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=460.74s)]
*  America is gonna be sending its Navy and its military [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=462.78000000000003s)]
*  to do humanitarian work, when at the same time, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=466.06s)]
*  weapons provided by America, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=468.74s)]
*  not to defend Israel itself from missile attacks, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=470.82000000000005s)]
*  but use weapons that are killing civilians in this moment. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=476.38s)]
*  And as you can imagine, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=480.46s)]
*  if international aid organizations like the UN, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=482.06s)]
*  like Jose Andres, stop doing their vital humanitarian work, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=485.41999999999996s)]
*  who is going to do it? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=489.78s)]
*  Is Israel going to do it? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=491.09999999999997s)]
*  That's all that's left, and we saw the catastrophe [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=492.74s)]
*  when they tried that, you know, freelancing, a few weeks ago, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=495.38s)]
*  and some 118 people were killed in shootings and a stampede. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=499.17999999999995s)]
*  It's a very critical issue right now. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=503.62s)]
*  Christian Amapour, thank you so much [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=507.14s)]
*  for all of your reporting as always, John. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=508.82s)]
*  As we are standing by for that phone call [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=511.82s)]
*  between the President and Prime Minister, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=513.34s)]
*  there already has been one conversation [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=514.74s)]
*  between US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=517.94s)]
*  and his Israeli counterpart. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=520.02s)]
*  So what took place there, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=521.7s)]
*  seen as Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=523.02s)]
*  Natasha, what did they have to say? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=525.26s)]
*  Well, John, it was largely a mirror image [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=528.94s)]
*  of the conversation that President Biden had, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=531.3s)]
*  the statement that President Biden had issued earlier this week [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=534.5s)]
*  that he was expressing outrage over this WCK strike. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=537.2600000000001s)]
*  Secretary Austin apparently told the Israeli Defense Minister [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=540.62s)]
*  that he too was outraged by this attack, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=543.82s)]
*  and he urged them to conduct a swift, thorough, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=546.3800000000001s)]
*  and independent investigation into this attack, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=549.1800000000001s)]
*  and importantly, something that we've heard [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=552.22s)]
*  from other administration officials as well, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=553.86s)]
*  they want the results of this investigation to be made public, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=555.9000000000001s)]
*  and they want someone to be held accountable [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=559.1s)]
*  for this tragic mistake, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=562.6600000000001s)]
*  which is what the Israelis are characterizing it as. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=565.62s)]
*  But the administration is really, at this point, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=568.38s)]
*  kind of withholding judgment [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=570.46s)]
*  about whether or not this was deliberate, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=571.86s)]
*  and for that reason, they are not giving any sense [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=574.1800000000001s)]
*  of whether or not they're going to shift their policy [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=576.94s)]
*  towards Israeli defense and arms sales, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=579.14s)]
*  which have been ongoing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=581.98s)]
*  As we reported earlier this week, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=583.1s)]
*  the administration is set to approve [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=584.94s)]
*  an $18 billion F-15 sale to the Israelis, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=586.26s)]
*  where the jets won't necessarily be delivered [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=590.02s)]
*  for another four to five years. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=592.58s)]
*  There are questions about why the administration, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=593.82s)]
*  while they're expressing outrage over this strike, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=596.34s)]
*  while they're expressing outrage over the fact [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=598.34s)]
*  that Israel does not appear to be doing enough [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=599.98s)]
*  to protect civilians, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=602.1s)]
*  is engaging in these arms sales with the Israelis, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=603.1s)]
*  and thereby kind of affirming that they view them [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=605.94s)]
*  as kind of a professional military [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=608.94s)]
*  that is capable of carrying out these operations [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  in a way that is consistent [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=612.98s)]
*  with how the U.S. would expect their allies to. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=614.22s)]
*  And so while Secretary Austin did reiterate [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=616.78s)]
*  that he is angry about this strike, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=619.14s)]
*  it remains to be seen whether anything [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=621.6999999999999s)]
*  is actually going to change [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=623.34s)]
*  when it comes to concrete U.S. actions, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=624.38s)]
*  because at this point, it does not seem [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=626.74s)]
*  as though the Israelis are necessarily listening [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=628.38s)]
*  to what the U.S. is saying, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=630.58s)]
*  and we're seeing that play out in real time, of course, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=632.1s)]
*  with the operation that they're planning [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=634.1s)]
*  in southern Gaza, in Ra'afah. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=635.54s)]
*  Yeah, indeed, indeed that is the case. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=637.58s)]
*  Obviously, a very important day as we watch it unfold. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=639.98s)]
*  Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon, thank you very much. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-t8H8bu6zw&t=643.42s)]
