# IDF spokesperson: ‘We’ll do what’s needed’ to stop attacks
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ)
*  Out front now, Israeli Major Ben Wohlhaus. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the Israel Defense Forces spokesperson. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=3.34s)]
*  Major, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=5.94s)]
*  First of all, what's the latest on the ground right now? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=7.94s)]
*  Thank you, Wolf. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=12.92s)]
*  The situation now is that we have secured the South. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=14.32s)]
*  We no longer have hundreds of terrorists [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=17.18s)]
*  streaming across the border trying to kill our civilians. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=19.92s)]
*  We still have forces that are going house by house, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=24.6s)]
*  making sure that none of them are left. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  Hundreds streamed across the border two days ago, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=29.76s)]
*  entered into more than 20 towns and cities. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=32.46s)]
*  So our forces are still going house by house [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=34.96s)]
*  to make sure that none of them are left. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=37.44s)]
*  At the same time, as your viewers know, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=39.6s)]
*  we are undergoing continuous rocket fire [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=41.900000000000006s)]
*  into our cities indiscriminate, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=44.28s)]
*  and that's the current situation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  So is it true that Israel is now in full control [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=48.44s)]
*  of all of its land at this hour? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=51.88s)]
*  Yes, that is correct. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=55.42s)]
*  We have fortified the border fence on Gaza as well. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  We have streamed forces down there, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=60.36s)]
*  and they are working to make sure [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=61.72s)]
*  that the entire South is safe and secure. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=63.3s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, as you well know, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=66.66s)]
*  said today that the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  in his words, are only the beginning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=71.8s)]
*  Are we looking right now at a ground war here as well? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=74.0s)]
*  Well, Hamas' attacks are continuing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=78.88s)]
*  The rocket fire is continuous. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=80.88s)]
*  I'm sitting here in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=82.94s)]
*  At my house in Tel Aviv, my children are continuously going [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=84.42s)]
*  to the ground, from the ground upstairs, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=87.62s)]
*  down to the basement, to the bomb shelter, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  sirens, all throughout Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=91.42s)]
*  So the IDF has been directed by the government [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=93.66000000000001s)]
*  to stop those attacks, and we'll do what's needed [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=95.86s)]
*  in order to stop those attacks [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=98.26s)]
*  and make sure that Hamas doesn't have [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=99.66000000000001s)]
*  the capability to renew them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  So you're clearly leaving open the possibility [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=103.22s)]
*  of a major Israeli ground invasion into Gaza [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=105.26s)]
*  to deal with that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=108.94s)]
*  The IDF has many capabilities, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=111.04s)]
*  and we're going to deploy them all [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  in order to stop Hamas' ability [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=114.94s)]
*  to start attacking our civilians. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=116.88s)]
*  As you know, Major, Hamas is saying [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  it will start executing the civilian hostages [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=121.1s)]
*  taken from Israel into Gaza [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=124.06s)]
*  and broadcasting it if Israel targets people in Gaza [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=126.8s)]
*  without warning. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=130.56s)]
*  Will that change Israel's response at all? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=131.94s)]
*  Well, that shouldn't surprise anyone. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=135.6s)]
*  Hamas' war here is a war on civilians. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=137.48s)]
*  It started with a massacre of women, children, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=140.28s)]
*  elderly, entire families. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=143.48s)]
*  They kidnapped tens of families and people [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=145.84s)]
*  and young people, toddlers, elderly women. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=149.68s)]
*  They're continuously firing rockets at our civilians, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=152.98s)]
*  and at the same time, they're hiding behind [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=155.94s)]
*  their civilians in Gaza to try and avoid attack from us [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=157.72s)]
*  and cause more civilian casualties. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=161.32s)]
*  So it's not surprising that they would say [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=163.62s)]
*  something like that, and our priority [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=165.26s)]
*  is to make sure that Hamas cannot carry any of that out [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=167.06s)]
*  and cannot continue attacking us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  Do you believe, Major, that some of the hostages [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=172.64s)]
*  may already be dead? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=175.52s)]
*  I don't have the information to give you that now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=178.6s)]
*  It's also for operational reasons, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=180.76s)]
*  but obviously our highest priority [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=183.1s)]
*  is to protect our people at home [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=184.66s)]
*  and also protect those people in Gaza, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=186.4s)]
*  and that's what our forces are doing [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=188.74s)]
*  in the land, sea, and air. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=190.18s)]
*  Major Ben Wohlhaus, the Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=192.4s)]
*  thanks very much for joining us. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=195.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=196.98s)]
*  And the war has tragically hit very close to home [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=198.34s)]
*  for my next guest, a man who has been on our network [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=201.42s)]
*  many times over the years, Mark Ginsburg, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=204.34s)]
*  the former U.S. Ambassador to Morocco, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=206.84s)]
*  former White House advisor on Middle East policy as well. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=209.14s)]
*  He just announced the death of his nephew, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  Elie Ginsburg, a Lieutenant Commander for Israel. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=215.22s)]
*  Ambassador, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=218.62s)]
*  You and I have known each other for many years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  We are so, so sorry for your loss this evening. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  What do you know so far about what happened to your nephew? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=226.82s)]
*  Elie was a Lieutenant Commander and a Navy SEAL in Israel, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=230.84s)]
*  and he had just retired from serving [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=236.56s)]
*  as an operational commander from Mossad three weeks ago [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=239.1s)]
*  and was called up to lead his unit into Kibbutz Reim, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=242.4s)]
*  where the music festival was taking place [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  to rescue hostages that were being held by Hamas. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=250.68s)]
*  And during one of the efforts to break down [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=256.46s)]
*  one of the apartment buildings, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=261.7s)]
*  he was shot and killed by a Moss terrorist. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=264.24s)]
*  I found that out from my sister-in-law this morning. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=270.1s)]
*  I'm here in Morocco doing earthling leaf work. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=272.98s)]
*  So it's been a terrible day for my family and I. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=276.22s)]
*  Our hearts go out to you, of course. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=279.52s)]
*  Give us a little bit more about your nephew, Ambassador. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=281.86s)]
*  What was he like? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=284.90000000000003s)]
*  Oh, Elie, he was the oldest of my three nephews [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=287.6s)]
*  who was raised on Kibbutz Mizgavim. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  My brother Mike had been killed up there in 2006, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=294.94s)]
*  so Elie had lost his father to Hezbollah [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=298.12s)]
*  in a Hezbollah attack in the war. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  And he was raised as someone dedicated [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=303.72s)]
*  to Israel's military prowess. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=307.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the fact that he became not only a Navy SEAL, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=310.06s)]
*  but also the Lieutenant Commander for the Navy SEALs, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=313.3s)]
*  and then trained in the United States [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  at the US Naval Academy in order to develop his skills [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=319.94s)]
*  to train Israelis in special command operations. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=325.72s)]
*  I mean, his work in the last year is pretty secret, Wolf, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=330.82s)]
*  but for those of us who, and I particularly, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  was his, I guess, substitute father, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=338.32s)]
*  we were so proud of him. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=342.85999999999996s)]
*  He leaves a beautiful wife in a Kibbutz, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=344.5s)]
*  and four children, as well as two brothers [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=347.65999999999997s)]
*  and my sister-in-law. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  And we're all mourning. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=352.9s)]
*  I can't make it, unfortunately, to the funeral tomorrow [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=354.14s)]
*  because the flights are extraordinarily hard, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=357.62s)]
*  but I'll make it to Israel to be with my family [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=360.84s)]
*  as soon as I can. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  And when you do, please pass along our deepest, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=364.56s)]
*  deepest condolences to your family. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=367.08s)]
*  As you know, the Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=369.56s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, has warned [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=371.82s)]
*  there will be difficult days ahead [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=373.16s)]
*  and that Israel will go on offense against Hamas, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  in his words, like never before. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=378.5s)]
*  What do you think that looks like, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=381.3s)]
*  specifically over the next 24 to 48 hours? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=383.1s)]
*  Well, I've listened, and Wolf, you and I know [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=387.56s)]
*  I've spent an enormous amount of time in Israel, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=389.90000000000003s)]
*  as well as in Gaza. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=392.04s)]
*  I've watched the successive efforts by Israel [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  to try to quell Hamas. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=397.72s)]
*  But I'll tell you, Wolf, my biggest fear, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=400.24s)]
*  based on the fact that my family lives up on Kibbutz, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  Mizgavam on the Lebanese border, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=406.18s)]
*  is that diabolically, given my own view and hatred [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=408.92s)]
*  for Hezbollah and Hamas, it's very conceivable [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=413.16s)]
*  that part of the scheme here directed by Iran [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=416.56s)]
*  is to exhaust Israel's supply of Iron Dome missiles [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=419.72s)]
*  because Hezbollah, as you all know, Wolf, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=423.6s)]
*  and you're an expert on this, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=426.46000000000004s)]
*  if Hamas fired 2,000 to 3,000 missiles at Israel [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  in a matter of two days, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=432.86s)]
*  Hezbollah has 150,000 guided missiles, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=435.8s)]
*  and no Iron Dome system that Israel currently has [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=439.2s)]
*  and has already badly depleted [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  can withstand that type of attack. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=445.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's a serious, very serious situation, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=448.52s)]
*  as I continue to say, and I hope I'm wrong, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=451.02s)]
*  this war is only just beginning. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=453.53999999999996s)]
*  Ambassador Mark Ginsburg, our deepest, deepest condolences [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=455.96s)]
*  to you and your family, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAVyXHFHEQ&t=458.4s)]
