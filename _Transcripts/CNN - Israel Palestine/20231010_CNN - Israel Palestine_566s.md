# Watch as Iron Dome intercepts Hamas' rockets over CNN correspondent's head
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs)
*  I can't think of a scenario where I've been sort of looking at rockets that are outgoing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=0.0s)]
*  and a colleague, dear colleague, you being underneath it and it's a bad eerie feeling. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=4.4s)]
*  And I just, when I see the rockets coming out of there, I want to be picking up the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=10.92s)]
*  phone and saying, guys, they're coming, they're coming. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=13.9s)]
*  But I know the defense system here is so strong that you're, as I'm seeing them come up, you're [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=16.72s)]
*  getting the sirens immediately. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=21.48s)]
*  I mean, you're getting those intercepts right over your head there. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Where actually from where we are, we can actually see the rockets, iron dome rockets themselves [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=26.56s)]
*  taking off and making those intercepts. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=31.4s)]
*  And we've been looking, I know you're trying to figure out if you can get to underneath [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=33.48s)]
*  the cloud of smoke, but John's pointing at that cloud of smoke. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=37.0s)]
*  Now we've been watching it get bigger. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=39.76s)]
*  It was small dark cloud of smoke. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=41.76s)]
*  Now it's like big and billowing and the smoke's gone kind of gray, but something's on fire [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  there because it hasn't gone out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=48.16s)]
*  It's putting out more smoke. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=51.08s)]
*  But yeah, when I see those rockets going out there and the intercepts above your head, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=52.2s)]
*  I'm just thinking about you and your team, Brent and Clayton. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=55.96s)]
*  And I'm hearing small arms fire behind me there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=61.96s)]
*  That's the Israeli Defense Force, I believe, will be firing towards Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=67.92s)]
*  I don't know if they've seen anything. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  Small arms fire guns, heavy machine guns, small machine guns. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Kate, back to you. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=76.6s)]
*  Absolutely, Nick. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=79.28s)]
*  No, we can hear that small arms fire right over your shoulder. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=80.28s)]
*  Have you been hearing that since this barrage kind of started up, right? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=83.28s)]
*  Basically right at 10 a.m. Eastern? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=89.28s)]
*  Yeah, not really. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, we don't get much small arms fire, but we had it in this town, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  Starrat, two days ago we had it and we knew that the IDF was going after some Hamas [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=99.52s)]
*  militants in the town because that's coming from towards Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=104.96s)]
*  Does that mean some Hamas militants have been spotted maybe at the border fence [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=108.52s)]
*  trying to get through the border fence? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=112.12s)]
*  Have they popped out a tunnel? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=113.44s)]
*  We're seeing intercepts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=114.92s)]
*  Clarissa, I believe that there is missiles coming your way because I'm seeing [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=116.0s)]
*  intercepts above your head. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=120.28s)]
*  So take cover. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=121.96s)]
*  There they're going up there, intercepting right there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=124.72s)]
*  OK, yeah, you can see right here, there you see them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=127.44s)]
*  Right above us, that's the Iron Dome intercepting. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=132.8s)]
*  Just sort of crouching here on the balcony, but you can see that Clayton, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=138.84s)]
*  Clayton, just keep a little bit inside. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=143.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=145.88s)]
*  So this is just the sirens went off a matter of seconds ago. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=146.88s)]
*  And now we're hearing as those rockets, it looks like most of them were [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=151.88s)]
*  intercepted by the Iron Dome up there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=158.28s)]
*  You can see the plumes of smoke from where they were literally stopped in their [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=160.28s)]
*  tracks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=166.68s)]
*  It seems that maybe it's a little bit quieter right now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=167.68s)]
*  Not clear. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=173.68s)]
*  Oh, there's another one. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=175.68s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=177.68s)]
*  You can hear a jet overhead now as well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=178.68s)]
*  It's not uncommon in these situations. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=181.68s)]
*  You'll hear the intercepts. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=183.68s)]
*  You'll hear the Iron Dome at work. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=185.68s)]
*  And then pretty quickly after that, you'll hear jets. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=187.68s)]
*  And then the distant thought of a strike in Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=189.68s)]
*  Still hearing those rockets being intercepted. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=194.68s)]
*  And just gives you a feel for the volume of rockets that are being used. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=199.68s)]
*  I think many people initially had been surprised by how many, how many rockets, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=208.68s)]
*  how extensive the stockpiling. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=217.68s)]
*  Oh, I can hear another. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=219.68s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=221.68s)]
*  How extensive the stockpiling and how effective it's been in terms of the sheer [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=223.68s)]
*  amount of rockets and some of them longer range rockets and missiles as well. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=228.68s)]
*  So now appears to be a little bit quieter. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=234.68s)]
*  We can still see those plumes of smoke from where the Iron Dome was activated. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=238.68s)]
*  We can still see a plume of darker smoke lower on the horizon from where one of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=244.68s)]
*  those rockets appears to have made impact earlier on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=249.68s)]
*  But clearly Hamas trying to send a very sobering message to the people of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=254.68s)]
*  Ashkelon today. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=261.68s)]
*  They warned people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=263.68s)]
*  They told them leave by 5 p.m. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=264.68s)]
*  And it has been pretty unrelenting in the, I forget how long we've been out here [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=266.68s)]
*  now, but what are we talking 35 minutes of pretty sustained, I would say, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=272.68s)]
*  barrages of rockets coming into this Seaport City. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=278.68s)]
*  Actually remarkable Clarissa. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=284.68s)]
*  It's John Berman here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=286.68s)]
*  We're seeing in real time the Iron Dome intercept those rockets over your head. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=287.68s)]
*  And if we can just show people this map very quickly so we can remind people [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=292.68s)]
*  where Clarissa is. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=296.68s)]
*  She is in Ashkelon right here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=297.68s)]
*  We have a very good view of the sky. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=299.68s)]
*  And we can see here our Nick Robertson. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=301.68s)]
*  And this is really also remarkable. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=303.68s)]
*  Nick Robertson was here in Sederot looking over Gaza as the rockets were being [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=305.68s)]
*  shot out into Ashkelon where Clarissa is. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=310.68s)]
*  Clarissa, we heard explosions and blasts there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=314.68s)]
*  Was that from the sky? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=319.68s)]
*  Can you distinguish between intercepts or whether there was any impact on the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=321.68s)]
*  ground from that last barrage? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=325.68s)]
*  You can usually distinguish as a slightly different sound when they're [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=329.68s)]
*  intercepted in the sky as opposed to when they make a direct hit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=332.68s)]
*  I will say the first barrage right at 5 o'clock was the most sustained, the most [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=335.68s)]
*  intensive, and the most amount of direct hits from what we heard. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=340.68s)]
*  We don't know where those hits may have happened with the exception of that one [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=344.68s)]
*  location where it appears that one of those rockets hit. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=348.68s)]
*  Again, we don't know exactly what was there, but we've been going out every day [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=353.68s)]
*  now and seeing the impact and effect that some of these rockets have. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=358.68s)]
*  They destroy cars. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=363.68s)]
*  They destroy homes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=364.68s)]
*  They leave craters in the streets. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=365.68s)]
*  And, of course, they have a very palpable effect on the psyche of ordinary people. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=368.68s)]
*  I think I hear a drone now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=374.68s)]
*  Again, drones very common at the moment for obvious reasons. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=377.68s)]
*  We heard some jets before as well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=382.68s)]
*  We had been hearing pretty much constant jet activity yesterday, but more so even [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=384.68s)]
*  the day before. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=390.68s)]
*  And it is this utterly discombobulating sense for people who live here between on [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=392.68s)]
*  the one hand sirens going off and people are frantically running to try to get to [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=397.68s)]
*  shelters and crouching and then you hear explosions in the sky. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=403.68s)]
*  And then five minutes later, everything feels quiet again. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=407.68s)]
*  You can hear the sea. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=411.68s)]
*  It's hard to imagine how people can live like this day in and day out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=414.68s)]
*  It's extremely difficult to kind of find any sense of equilibrium. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=419.68s)]
*  And we have definitely noticed that the tempo in Ashkelon today, this afternoon, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=424.68s)]
*  has dramatically escalated, John. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=430.68s)]
*  Clarissa, thank you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=435.68s)]
*  Stand by for a second. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=436.68s)]
*  Let's go back to Nick Robertson and Cinderella. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=437.68s)]
*  Nick, you were hearing firing. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=439.68s)]
*  Describe what you were hearing and what you think it might have been. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=441.68s)]
*  We were hearing what sounded like small arms fire, machine gun fire. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=448.68s)]
*  And that typically the Israeli defense forces won't fire their machine guns unless [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=454.68s)]
*  they're close to a target. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=459.68s)]
*  And then we could hear what sounded like exchanges of fire, sustained bursts of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=461.68s)]
*  fire coming from that direction towards the border fence there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=466.68s)]
*  As Sarah was saying, it's literally 2,700 meters, I think is what you said, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=471.68s)]
*  Sarah, the distance between where we're at and the border fence. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=476.68s)]
*  And if Hamas is still trying to make incursions, we were down in that area today. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=480.68s)]
*  We were probably about 700 meters from the border fence earlier today. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=484.68s)]
*  And there are a lot of Israeli troops down in that area, combat troops in jeeps, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=488.68s)]
*  in tanks, in armored vehicles. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=495.68s)]
*  They're ready for the potential of more Hamas militants trying to slip inside [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=497.68s)]
*  Israel. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=502.68s)]
*  So it's possible that that's what we've just heard there. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=503.68s)]
*  But the fact that the gunfire has subsided tells me that whatever that contact, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=506.68s)]
*  to use the military parlance, was, the contact is broken at the moment. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=511.68s)]
*  They're not engaged in a firefight. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  So that is over unless we hear it start up again. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  But what we did here during when Clarissa was under that bombardment again just in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=523.68s)]
*  the past few minutes, we did hear a lot of artillery fire being fired from the [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=528.68s)]
*  Israeli forces into Gaza. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=533.68s)]
*  That's very accurate artillery that they use to try to target the firing points, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=535.68s)]
*  to try to get the Hamas militants who are firing the rockets. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=540.68s)]
*  And further south in Gaza, I did hear a series of even bigger explosions. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=544.68s)]
*  And those may have been associated with that fighter jet. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=550.68s)]
*  I'm hearing another sound explosion, detonation ripple through the air. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=553.68s)]
*  That may have been associated with the fighter jets that both Clarissa and I heard [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=557.68s)]
*  flying in over Gaza just in the past few minutes. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni1vHdQtWbs&t=562.68s)]
