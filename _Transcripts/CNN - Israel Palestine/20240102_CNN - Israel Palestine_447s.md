# Senior Hamas leader killed in attack in Beirut
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk)
*  Tonight, a senior Hamas leader is dead amid serious concerns the war in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=0.0s)]
*  is about to get bigger. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=5.32s)]
*  Salih al-Rourie, a top official in Hamas's military and political wings, killed in Beirut. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=6.32s)]
*  Hamas says the leader was killed by an Israeli airstrike. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=11.4s)]
*  Israel, however, is not taking responsibility. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=13.84s)]
*  And this is all happening as Iran has dispatched a naval destroyer to the Red Sea. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Tensions there escalating following a series of attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=21.44s)]
*  including against the United States. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=26.52s)]
*  And now the U.S. Navy has killed Houthis for the first time since this conflict broke [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=28.76s)]
*  out, sinking three Houthi boots at boats, rather, after being attacked in the Red Sea [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=32.4s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=37.400000000000006s)]
*  Orren Lieberman is out front tonight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Orren, the U.S. really getting drawn further and further into this conflict. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Iranian involvement clearly evident. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=44.8s)]
*  What is the U.S. going to do next? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  Erika, the Biden administration's position is they don't want to see a regional escalation. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=49.6s)]
*  They don't want to see a widening of the war. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  But clearly, it's not just up to the U.S. to make a unilateral decision in this case. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=56.44s)]
*  The events we've seen over the course of the past couple days make a widening of the war [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=60.68s)]
*  and escalation a growing possibility. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  Not only, as you pointed out over the weekend, the U.S. military and U.S. attack helicopters [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=67.52s)]
*  sinking three Houthi fast attack boats that were going after a commercial vessel and killing [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  the crews of those for the first time since the war, but also now the killing of Salah [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=76.56s)]
*  al-Aruri, a senior Hamas militant, in Beirut. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=81.28s)]
*  So the U.S. has to watch all of this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=84.96s)]
*  The U.S. does have the backing of an international coalition in the Red Sea, and that gives it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  essentially some weight here in its actions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=90.88s)]
*  The U.S. monitoring that Iranian Navy vessel that's in the Red Sea from the U.S.'s position. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=93.52s)]
*  It is an international waterway, a critical one at that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  So they're allowed to be there, but the U.S. military will keep a very close eye on them [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=101.72s)]
*  as it watches where this all goes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  For the killing of Salah al-Aruri, who you saw there with the Ayatollah, the leader of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=108.32s)]
*  that we've seen promises of revenge and condemnation from the Iranians, from Hamas, Hezbollah, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=113.2s)]
*  and even some others. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=119.12s)]
*  The question now, of course, what do they do? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  And they have a number of options, all of these Iranian proxies. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=122.4s)]
*  Attack U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=125.72s)]
*  Go after U.S. vessels in the Red Sea with the Houthis there from Yemen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=128.0s)]
*  Attack Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=131.88s)]
*  Iran doesn't really see much of a difference between the U.S. and Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=132.88s)]
*  So these are all possibilities that we have to watch out for and that the U.S. is watching [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=135.88s)]
*  out for. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=140.36s)]
*  And on that note, Israel hasn't officially taken responsibility for the killing of Salah [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=141.36s)]
*  al-Aruri in Beirut. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=144.8s)]
*  Israeli officials have been a bit coy about this, but it is worth pointing to this tweet [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=146.60000000000002s)]
*  from Danny Danon, a current member of Knesset and a former Israeli ambassador to the U.N. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  He said on Twitter, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=155.28s)]
*  I congratulate the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Mossad, and the security forces for killing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=156.28s)]
*  senior Hamas officials Salah al-Aruri in Beirut. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=160.4s)]
*  Anyone who was involved in the October 7th massacre should know that we will reach them [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=163.4s)]
*  and settle the account with them. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=166.88000000000002s)]
*  So Erika, pretty clear there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=168.28000000000003s)]
*  It's also worth remembering that Benjamin Netanyahu promised Israel would go after Hamas [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=169.84s)]
*  leaders wherever they are. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=173.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's for sure. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=174.72s)]
*  Oren, appreciate the reporting as always. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=175.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=177.24s)]
*  Out front now, retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hurtlang. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=178.76s)]
*  Good to see you tonight. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=181.6s)]
*  So let's pick up right there where Oren left off, the senior Hamas leader general who was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=182.6s)]
*  killed by the strike in southern Lebanon, also a longtime military political leader [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  in Hamas. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=191.8s)]
*  How likely do you think some sort of retaliation is in the next 24 to 48 hours? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=193.68s)]
*  This is what Oren's reporting, first of all, Erika, was phenomenal. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=198.6s)]
*  But this is the kind of thing that the Biden administration has been worried about. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=203.04s)]
*  They have been trying to repress any kind of expansion of this conflict. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=206.56s)]
*  And this strike in Beirut against a Hamas leader is not going to help that at all. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  You also have to consider that Hezbollah leader, Nezrallah, has said that any strikes inside [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=216.44s)]
*  of Lebanon by Israel, especially in Beirut, will cause serious repercussions for the Israelis. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=221.82s)]
*  This is the Hezbollah leader. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=228.4s)]
*  What Israel has been trying to do is not allow this to come into a multi-front war. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=230.04000000000002s)]
*  But we're already seeing that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=236.08s)]
*  They are fighting hard in Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=237.3s)]
*  They have been fighting hard in northern Israel against the Hezbollah terrorists coming out [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=239.56s)]
*  of southern Lebanon. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  They've now struck in Beirut. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  They've had these missile attacks from Yemen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=250.70000000000002s)]
*  We've seen PMF forces in Iraq and Syria continue to try and attempt to influence this operation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=253.34s)]
*  This is a tinderbox right now, Erika. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=259.86s)]
*  And as we look at this tinderbox, too, as we look at the broader region here, the Iranian [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=263.7s)]
*  naval destroyer now heading to the Red Sea, days after the U.S. sunk three Houthi ships, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=267.76s)]
*  killing all on board. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=272.14s)]
*  Can the U.S. at this point avoid getting drawn in deeper? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=273.9s)]
*  It's going to be challenging. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=277.74s)]
*  It's going to depend on what that Iranian naval vessel does in the Red Sea. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=279.58s)]
*  Those are international waters. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=285.65999999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of transportation and elements going through that that are noncombatant. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=287.41999999999996s)]
*  The strike against the three Houthi rebel boats that tried to attack the Maersk carrier [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=295.62s)]
*  the other day is an indicator of what the Iranians are attempting to do by putting a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  a naval destroyer in this area confronting an entire carrier strike group from the United [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=305.88s)]
*  States. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=312.44s)]
*  It has the potential for explosive activity, and it's going to be very dangerous. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=315.04s)]
*  The naval forces in that area are going to have to watch their step and be very careful [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  about what they do. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=323.34s)]
*  I'd also like to get your take on what we're seeing in Ukraine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=324.34s)]
*  I mean, this really astounding number of Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukraine, at least [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  500 over the past five days. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=333.04s)]
*  That's according to President Zelensky. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=335.56s)]
*  We know at least five people killed today, at least 53, the number stands at now, killed [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  from Friday's massive attacks. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=341.52000000000004s)]
*  We are nearly two years now into this war. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=343.68s)]
*  How do you read the message that Putin is sending to Ukraine? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=347.42s)]
*  Well, first of all, from the tactical perspective, what Russia has been trying to do is, I'll [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=350.08000000000004s)]
*  use a basketball term, flood the zone. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  They are trying to put as many missiles in the air as they can, and they're all different [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=357.72s)]
*  types coming from multiple directions and multiple platforms, air, sea and ground. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  They are some of the types of missiles, the hypersonic missiles are very advanced, but [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=367.68s)]
*  Ukraine has been very successful in shooting most of them down. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  Today's activity, Ukraine was very successful. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=379.08000000000004s)]
*  But what I would say is two things are happening. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  First of all, Russia is continuing their strategic approach to try and affect Ukrainian infrastructure. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=384.76s)]
*  To make it a harsh winter for Ukrainian citizens to continue to say, even though the United [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=392.4s)]
*  States and others may be balking, we're still going to attack Ukraine. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=397.52s)]
*  And what's happening from the Ukrainian side is they just don't have enough air defense [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=402.2s)]
*  to cover everything. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=406.62s)]
*  Air defense or points, weapons systems, Erica, that means they have to be placed in a location [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=408.58s)]
*  to guard a specific target. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=413.3s)]
*  So that means you can't defend everywhere. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  So the reason Russia is attacking so many different targets is they are trying to figure [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=417.86s)]
*  out where Ukraine is soft and where they have their defenses. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=422.26s)]
*  And I think that's going to continue on for the next couple of days. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  And it just shows the importance of the United States getting the Congress back and passing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=430.62s)]
*  this bill, which will give more ammo and arms to Ukraine during this period of time. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=435.58s)]
*  This is a critical period. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=442.14s)]
*  Well, Senator General Mark Kerling, always appreciate your insight. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=443.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOhZBj3Xidk&t=446.21999999999997s)]
