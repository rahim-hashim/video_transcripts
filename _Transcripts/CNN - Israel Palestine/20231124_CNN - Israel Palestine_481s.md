# Blogger leaves haunting words in final video from Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34)
*  Civilians and guards have been struggling to survive the war intensified there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=0.0s)]
*  One young blogger's video diary has documented the struggles and tragedies people have endured [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=4.4s)]
*  in the enclave amid the conflict. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=9.68s)]
*  Simez Jemana Karachi has that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=12.52s)]
*  Life before the wars felt like a distant memory for video blogger Ayat Khadoura. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=17.88s)]
*  They were the days when she'd smile in her videos, taking her followers behind the scenes [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=24.16s)]
*  of her work in Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=28.84s)]
*  For weeks now, her posts have been about life at a time of war. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=33.8s)]
*  We now wake up at 5 a.m. to queue for bread. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  We now walk more than six kilometers to fill up a gallon of salty or fresh water. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=44.16s)]
*  We charge our phones on the streets using the solar power we can find. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  We crave our favorite foods, but there's no power, no gas or water, so we have to make [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=52.6s)]
*  do with canned foods. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=57.44s)]
*  Ayat showed people how Gazans survive, neighbors sharing the little they have to bake bread [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=59.04s)]
*  in clay ovens. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=64.08s)]
*  And at times, it was about how close death felt as bombs rained down on Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=65.08s)]
*  This might be my last video. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=73.68s)]
*  They dropped leaflets asking people to evacuate the area. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=75.4s)]
*  Most people fled. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=78.72s)]
*  People were running in the streets like crazy, not knowing where to go. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=80.08s)]
*  The situation is terrifying. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=83.56s)]
*  God have mercy on us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=85.56s)]
*  As the war intensified in the north, Ayat didn't leave. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=87.12s)]
*  The safety they were told to evacuate to in the south was an illusion. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=94.56s)]
*  Nowhere in Gaza is safe, she said. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=98.68s)]
*  Death and destruction is everywhere in Gaza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=103.68s)]
*  The occupation has no mercy on anyone, not the elderly, not the children, not the women, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=106.22s)]
*  no one. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  Civilians are under fire in Gaza. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=112.96s)]
*  Where are the decision-makers? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Where's the world? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=116.96s)]
*  Gaza is being annihilated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=118.36s)]
*  We are dying. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=121.16s)]
*  Someone do something, enough. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=122.52s)]
*  But these desperate cries of so many like Ayat haven't stopped this seemingly endless [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=130.04s)]
*  nightmare for the people of Gaza, where burying their dead has become their every day. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=137.12s)]
*  Where every moment feels like it may be their last. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=143.0s)]
*  On Monday, it was Ayat's, killed along with other family members in a night of intense [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=147.44s)]
*  bombardment of Beit Lahya. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=152.72s)]
*  Her last video, the haunting words of a 27-year-old with a final message from Gaza to the world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=155.0s)]
*  We're humans like everyone else. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=166.32s)]
*  We had big dreams. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  Now our dream is, if we are killed, we are a body in one piece, so we can be identified, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=170.2s)]
*  buried in a grave, not body parts in a bag. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=175.6s)]
*  When will this war end? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=181.88s)]
*  Who will remain to tell people what happened to us, what we lived through, what we've witnessed? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=183.48s)]
*  Jemana Karachi, CNN, London. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=190.72s)]
*  The truce between Israel and Hamas appears to be holding, meaning other pieces of the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=193.83999999999997s)]
*  deal are kicking into gear. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=198.84s)]
*  A convoy of United Nations trucks packed with tons of humanitarian aid. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=201.32s)]
*  Now moving into Gaza via Egypt's Rafah crossing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=206.04s)]
*  Let's speak to Eleni Jokos, who is live for us in Cairo. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=209.52s)]
*  So it's playing out as you expected. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=213.96s)]
*  We've talked about the amount of aid. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=216.6s)]
*  It's not quite enough. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=218.24s)]
*  Well, it's not nearly enough to deal with the problem there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=219.24s)]
*  But it is significant that those trucks are going in. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  It is significant and it is significantly way more than we've seen since October 7th. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=227.68s)]
*  Important to remember that before the war began, there were over 445 trucks going into [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=233.6s)]
*  Gaza on a daily basis on a good day. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=240.84s)]
*  So this was a population that already heavily relied on aid. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=243.44s)]
*  And then you see the war breaking out and now we're hearing the just absolute catastrophic [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=248.88s)]
*  scenarios on the ground and really reiterated by the international aid organizations. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=253.28s)]
*  But I want to take you through what we've seen today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=257.56s)]
*  You and I have been talking about how much we've been seeing, you know, how many trucks [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=260.04s)]
*  have been gathering at the border over the last few days in anticipation for this truce [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  to kick in. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=268.92s)]
*  Because there is an understanding of just how many delays occur because of the checkpoints, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=269.92s)]
*  because they need to figure out the logistics on not only the Egyptian side, but also once [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=274.92s)]
*  they cross over into Gaza. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=279.92s)]
*  90 trucks, 8 trucks have now gone into the Gaza side of the border. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=282.48s)]
*  That is significant. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=287.12s)]
*  So they've gone through the initial checkpoints. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=288.12s)]
*  They then get checked on the Israeli side of the border as well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=290.24s)]
*  Then they're offloaded and then move straight into Gaza. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=293.44s)]
*  Seven fuel trucks as well going in. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=296.76s)]
*  We've also heard from the IDF that say that the gas quota that has gone in already today [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=299.24s)]
*  is specifically for cooking purposes, for humanitarian needs and humanitarian infrastructure. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=306.08s)]
*  They've been very clear to say that this was part of the deal. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=312.0s)]
*  Overall, over four days, 208 trucks are expected to go in, 130,000 liters of diesel fuel together [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  with other gas trucks as well expected to go in. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=322.52s)]
*  You've reiterated the point. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  It is a fraction of the needs. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  Even the Qatari said that yesterday, you know, the testimonies we've heard from people inside [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=329.32s)]
*  of Gaza that they were scrambling for just pieces of bread, running out of water, drinking [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=335.88s)]
*  dirty water and of course, diseases playing out right now, which has created another layer [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  of the humanitarian crisis. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=346.96s)]
*  We also have heard from the Egyptians for the first time since the war started, Max, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=349.68s)]
*  that Palestinians that are in Egypt or were stranded in Egypt, if they wish to return [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  to Gaza, they are able to do so through Rafa. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=358.6s)]
*  That is quite important to remember. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=362.12s)]
*  We've heard some movement on that that could be occurring today. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=364.88s)]
*  Injured Palestinians are coming through the Rafa border, so too are foreign nationals [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=368.08s)]
*  and dual passport holders. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=371.92s)]
*  And you know, just today, seeing some of the images that are going through, there were [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  actually banners on some of these trucks that read, together for humanity and then also [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=377.56s)]
*  for our brothers in Gaza. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=383.24s)]
*  So everyone trying to take an opportunity here for this window that is opened up. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=385.24s)]
*  With the logistical side, Max, we should not forget what it takes to actually get that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  aid distributed in the south of Gaza in the very least. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=395.88s)]
*  I was speaking to Oxfam a bit earlier. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  They were describing how they've got this huge challenge because there's lots of aid [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=402.44s)]
*  agencies that were using crossings between Israel and Gaza in the past. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=407.04s)]
*  They've had to move all of their logistics, all of their operations into Egypt, which [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=412.20000000000005s)]
*  has been a huge challenge. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=416.24s)]
*  So this isn't, you know, hasn't been easy getting those trucks there for a start. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=418.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=426.35999999999996s)]
*  And I think that, you know, one of the things that we keep talking about is just, you know, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  can we get more aid into Gaza? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=431.0s)]
*  But logistically, it's always been a challenge. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  It's the warehousing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=434.28s)]
*  It's the logistical side of things. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=435.68s)]
*  It's the value chains you really need to think of. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  And the fact that these trucks that do go into Gaza don't just drive into Gaza and distribute [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  aid. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=444.2s)]
*  They're really offloaded into trucks by the Palestinian Red Crescent. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=445.44s)]
*  So there is so many elements to this. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=448.64s)]
*  And it's also the checkpoints that really slow things down. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=451.12s)]
*  You know, the UN's Martin Griffiths specifically said that Israel has the final say on how [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=454.52s)]
*  much aid goes in. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=459.08s)]
*  And of course, the idea of saying that they have been part of the deal in terms of the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=460.64s)]
*  fuel question, because we know that that has always been a sticking point because it could [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=465.64s)]
*  add up in the hands of Hamas. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=469.56s)]
*  OK, Eleni in Cairo, thank you with you throughout the day as this story continues in the 8 [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=472.28s)]
*  trickles in. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f0Onb1RV34&t=477.76s)]
