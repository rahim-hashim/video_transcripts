# Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s surprisingly good year
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg)
*  Might be hard to believe if you've been following Israel or the war in Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=0.0s)]
*  but Benjamin Netanyahu has had a good year. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=3.48s)]
*  Let me explain. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=6.0s)]
*  After October 7th, he was in a terrible place. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=7.28s)]
*  And have you at all considered stepping down? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=10.0s)]
*  And the year that followed was bloody. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=11.92s)]
*  The Israeli military killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, mostly civilians, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=13.76s)]
*  and it sent ground troops into Lebanon and Syria and launched airstrikes on Yemen and Iran. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  And there's serious repercussions. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=23.84s)]
*  The International Criminal Court charged Netanyahu with war crimes and issued an arrest warrant for him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=25.44s)]
*  The country is facing multiple accusations of genocide against the Palestinians, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=30.48s)]
*  something he and Israel's lawyers both strenuously deny. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=34.72s)]
*  He has legal problems at home too. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  Corruption charges made him the first prime minister in Israel's history to defend himself in criminal court. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=40.56s)]
*  But despite all of this, he's had a good year. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=46.08s)]
*  His governing coalition is more stable because he fired his defense minister and brought in obsequious allies. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=48.84s)]
*  In the U.S., his close friend Donald Trump is going to be in the White House soon. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=55.12s)]
*  But here's the key factor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=59.32s)]
*  Regional war is actually good for him, at least politically. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=61.68s)]
*  It means the focus isn't on Gaza or the hostages. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=65.0s)]
*  The focus is on Iran, a familiar boogeyman for Netanyahu. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=68.44s)]
*  Now he can cast himself again as Mr. Security, the protector of Israelis. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=72.28s)]
*  There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=77.36s)]
*  2024 showed just how high a tightrope he's walking. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=80.44s)]
*  And the next chapter has yet to be written. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX3NBM68Jfg&t=83.76s)]
