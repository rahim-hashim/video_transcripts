# Netanyahu's spokesperson says Israel is defining 'gold standard of urban warfare' in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc)
*  Tal Heinrich, she is spokesperson for the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=0.0s)]
*  And Tal, it's great to be with you, of course, here in New York. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=4.72s)]
*  So, you know, just to start with the limited flooding of the tunnels that we understand [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=7.0s)]
*  the IDF is doing, Israel says it's doing on a limited basis in tunnels where they do not [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=13.24s)]
*  believe hostages are being held. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=18.16s)]
*  President Biden says that is an assertion that he cannot confirm it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=19.96s)]
*  How do you know for sure that there are no hostages in the tunnels being flooded? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=23.92s)]
*  First, Erin, regarding the tunnels, I cannot comment on operational military activity happening [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=27.6s)]
*  on the ground or anything strategic moving ahead. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=32.16s)]
*  This is a question that you will have to refer to the IDF. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=35.68s)]
*  What I can say is that we said in the past, the IDF spokesperson has said that we're looking [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=38.16s)]
*  at various ways to eliminate these tunnels. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=41.8s)]
*  We have eliminated much of the tunnel infrastructure, but there are still many of them, as you heard [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=44.36s)]
*  from your reporter, also in the area of Khan Yunus, where our forces are now operating. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  And obviously, when we work on the ground to eliminate the Hamas terrorist regime in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=56.04s)]
*  Gaza, the hostages situation is the top of minds. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=60.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=64.64s)]
*  I'm curious, though, and I understand they're saying where they don't believe the hostages [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=65.64s)]
*  are, but a question to you just on an intelligence basis. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=68.68s)]
*  If Israel knows where they are not, do you know where they are? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=72.2s)]
*  Well, again, this is a question for the IDF. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=77.48s)]
*  What we know is that Hamas is in response to pressure. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=80.62s)]
*  We have seen the release of hostages so far based on the outline that we agreed upon [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=83.28s)]
*  because thanks to the military pressure, and we continue to hit them hard because we want [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=87.24s)]
*  to reach the twofold goal, the mission that we have defined for this war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=91.56s)]
*  So President Biden has warned Israel it's losing support, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=95.04s)]
*  He said to the Prime Minister Netanyahu, you need to change your tactics and likely your [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=97.84s)]
*  government. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=102.06s)]
*  Is there a response from the Prime Minister tonight? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=104.2s)]
*  Well, first, Israel is a democratic state. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=106.44s)]
*  The ones who choose the government, as you know, are the people of Israel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=108.76s)]
*  Right now, my country is not dealing with politics, Erin, from left to right. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  There's a public consensus. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  We're all united right now around the goal, and the goal is to defeat Hamas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=117.2s)]
*  You know, when the terrorists targeted us on October 7, they didn't ask who voted for [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=121.76s)]
*  which party. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=126.88000000000001s)]
*  They didn't care. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, some of these hardest hit communities, and I know that you've been to the southern [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=128.88s)]
*  areas are honestly the people who are most staunch supporters of the Palestinian cause [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=133.18s)]
*  in certain areas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=142.3s)]
*  Many of them were in those kibbutzim. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=143.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=145.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=146.3s)]
*  So in terms of the civilians, General Clark was talking about how when you flood, there's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=147.3s)]
*  unknown consequences at this point. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=151.9s)]
*  Could involve, say, buildings coming down, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, unknown at this point as he lays it out. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=155.98000000000002s)]
*  A lot of civilians have died. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=159.62s)]
*  We know that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=160.84s)]
*  Israel says, the IDF says they've killed at least 7,000 Hamas members. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=162.38s)]
*  Obviously, we can't independently confirm that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=166.26s)]
*  But I did recently speak to Jonathan Konrick, IDF spokesperson, and I had asked him about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=168.42s)]
*  a report that said that senior Israeli military officials said that they were basically killing [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=172.82s)]
*  two civilians for every Hamas member. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=178.1s)]
*  And he called that a, quote, tremendously positive ratio. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=180.98s)]
*  That if it was two civilians for every one Hamas, that's tremendously positive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=185.44s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=189.3s)]
*  Well, it depends what you compare Israel to. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  If you compare Israel to perfection, of course, nobody's perfect. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  We don't want to see any civilian casualty. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=196.9s)]
*  We want to ease the civilian suffering in Gaza. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=198.58s)]
*  The IDF is going to such extents that no other Western military, no other military has done [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  before to safeguard the civilian population in an enemy war zone. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=206.9s)]
*  And I think that Israel is really defining the gold standard here of urban warfare. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=211.78s)]
*  And if you compare the campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, the civilian to casualty [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=217.52s)]
*  ratio, then Israel, once the dust would settle, you will see that Israel compares favorably. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=223.56s)]
*  And I understand that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=229.52s)]
*  I understand that sort of academically, if those numbers are put out there, when you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=230.52s)]
*  talk about the gold standard. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=234.32000000000002s)]
*  But yet, what we are confronted with every day is a horrific loss of Palestinian life [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=235.32000000000002s)]
*  and a lot of anguish. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=239.36s)]
*  It is hard to hear that being the gold standard. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=241.08s)]
*  Every civilian casualty is a huge tragedy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=245.84s)]
*  There hasn't been a war in human history, even the most justified ones that haven't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=248.56s)]
*  seen a certain extent of collateral damage. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=254.0s)]
*  But again, what we are doing on the ground, the fact that we are telling the civilian [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=256.56s)]
*  population where our soldiers are entering and when, this is unprecedented. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=260.4s)]
*  And I'm sure that some family and friends of US Armed Forces service members watching [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=265.76s)]
*  us right now would wonder who does that? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=270.9s)]
*  Who announces where the troops are exactly going to operate so that civilians and the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=273.36s)]
*  terrorists would know? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=276.88s)]
*  This is what the IDF is doing because we're a moral military. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=278.71999999999997s)]
*  We're a moral country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=281.48s)]
*  I want to give you a chance to respond to another report that aired on CNN last night. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=282.48s)]
*  My colleague Nima Al-Baghra was reporting on some of the money that has gone to Hamas. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=285.8s)]
*  Obviously, a lot of money in recent years. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=289.71999999999997s)]
*  And questions about whether Netanyahu's policies actually aided and abetted that by allowing [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars in actual cash to go into Gaza from Hamas, despite concerns [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=296.52s)]
*  from Netanyahu's own government, some of which were raised by then Education Minister [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=302.48s)]
*  Naftali Bennett, who spoke to Nema. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=306.88s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=308.88s)]
*  I stopped the cash suitcases because I believe that's a horrendous mistake to allow Hamas [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=312.04s)]
*  to have all these suitcases full of cash that goes directly to re-arming themselves against [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=320.12s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=326.56s)]
*  Why would we feed them cash to kill us? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=327.76s)]
*  So when he says he stopped it, he's referring to when he became prime minister, he's saying [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  he stopped the Netanyahu policy that he refers to as cash in suitcases. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Does Netanyahu believe now that he made a mistake by allowing cash to go in? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=341.12s)]
*  Well, again, this is a, we allowed money to go inside Gaza, not for Hamas, obviously. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=344.8s)]
*  And it's not only a policy that happened, by the way, during this government, the previous [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=351.92s)]
*  Israeli governments, because we wanted the money to reach the Palestinian people to fix [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=356.16s)]
*  the water system that we saw Hamas has turned pipes, water pipes into missiles, the sewage [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=361.68s)]
*  system and so forth. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=367.2s)]
*  We wanted to. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=368.72s)]
*  But you knew it wasn't being used for those purposes because you could see the systems. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=369.72s)]
*  Well, listen, it's a major problem every time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's a repeating pattern here in history. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=376.92s)]
*  Every time the state of Israel has got more slack to the Palestinian people, it backfired. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=379.12s)]
*  It was answered with more bloodshed, more murder. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=383.84000000000003s)]
*  If you go back to the 1947 partition plan of the United Nations, we said yes, they said [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  no, they started a war against us. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=396.32s)]
*  We retreated from Gaza. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=398.28s)]
*  We signed the Oslo Accords. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  We got suicide bombings in our cities. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  In 2005, the Disengagement Act from Gaza. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=403.84s)]
*  We got missiles raining on our communities. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=406.2s)]
*  And now we allowed in more fake rehabilitation efforts and we cut more slack to Palestinian [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  workers who wanted to work in Israel, expanded the fishing zone. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=413.4s)]
*  What did we get? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=416.72s)]
*  The October 7th massacre. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=417.72s)]
*  It's a repeating pattern. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=418.72s)]
*  All right, well, Tal, I appreciate your time and thank you very much. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=419.72s)]
*  It's good to see you in person. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvhhevXbrZc&t=423.68s)]
