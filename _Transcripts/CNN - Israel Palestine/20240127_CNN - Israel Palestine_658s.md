# CNN video shows Palestinian detainees blindfolded and barefoot near Gaza border
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A)
*  A CNN team witnessed Israeli soldiers with Palestinian detainees who were [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=0.0s)]
*  blindfolded and barefoot. UN human rights officials have previously urged [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=5.84s)]
*  Israel to end what they called the mistreatment of Palestinians, which [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=10.28s)]
*  included the use of blindfolds. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has this reporting [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  force and joins us now live. Jeremy, what did you learn? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  Well, Fred, my team and I were in southern Israel today near the border [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=25.0s)]
*  with Gaza when suddenly we spotted more than two dozen men, some of them [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=28.2s)]
*  kneeling, some of them sitting on the ground with Israeli soldiers standing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=32.44s)]
*  around them. We now know that these men were Palestinians detained by the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=36.68s)]
*  Israeli military in Gaza and brought to Israel for further questioning. Now, if [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=40.8s)]
*  you look at the video here that we have, these men were blindfolded, they were [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=46.04s)]
*  barefoot and keep in mind that it was about 50 degrees Fahrenheit during this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=49.56s)]
*  day and all they're wearing are these disposable white coveralls. Their hands [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  are tied behind their backs and you can see that many of these men are clearly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=60.4s)]
*  physically exhausted, their heads kind of nodding down, bobbing, swaying. One [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=64.24s)]
*  man was lying on the ground before an Israeli soldier comes to rouse him, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=69.8s)]
*  propping him back up so that he can be sitting on the ground. Now, the Israeli [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=73.44s)]
*  military told us this in a statement saying, quote, these the individuals [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=78.16s)]
*  are suspected of terrorist activity and were arrested in Gaza and transferred [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=82.8s)]
*  to Israel for further interrogation. Relevant suspects are taken for further [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=87.24s)]
*  questioning within Israel. Individuals who were found not to be taking part in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=92.04s)]
*  terrorist activities are released back into Gaza as soon as possible. Now, they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=96.44s)]
*  also address the conditions in which we found these detainees talking about the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=101.44s)]
*  fact that they were wearing these white coveralls because they had been [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  stripped. Their clothing searched to ensure that they were not carrying [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=109.60000000000001s)]
*  weapons or explosives, and they said that they would be given clothing once [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=113.56s)]
*  they arrived at that detention facility. They also said that when we came [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=117.8s)]
*  across them that they were about to be put on a heated bus in order to be [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=121.72s)]
*  taken to that detention facility, we weren't able to see exactly how long [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=126.2s)]
*  these men were actually on the ground there for. And that's because an [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=130.36s)]
*  Israeli soldier came to us and demanded that we leave the premises once he saw [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=133.96s)]
*  us filming. Now, as it relates to Israel's the Israeli military's claims [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=139.28s)]
*  here that these air terror suspects, it's important to note that we have [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=143.72s)]
*  while this is the first time that we have been able to unilaterally [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=147.4s)]
*  directly document these detentions, there have been a lot of videos of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=151.1s)]
*  Palestinian men and boys in Gaza detained by the Israeli military, and in [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  many cases they have proven to be civilians. They have been identified by [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=160.68s)]
*  their friends or relatives in videos as civilians. We also interview 10 [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=164.22s)]
*  Palestinian men and boys back in December, who said that they were [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  arrested and detained by the Israeli military for five days without charge [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=172.38s)]
*  before being ultimately released. When they were released, those men and boys [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=177.38s)]
*  had swollen wrists, bruises on their wrists in some cases from the fact that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=182.14s)]
*  their hands were tied behind their backs for the duration of that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=187.1s)]
*  detention. Now, the Israeli military, for its part, insists that it proceeds [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  with international law in all of these cases, Fred. And then Jeremy [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=195.70000000000002s)]
*  separately, more countries are pausing funding for the United Nation relief [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=201.38s)]
*  agencies operating in Gaza. The idea of, you know, said today that those [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=206.5s)]
*  facilities were used for terrorist purposes. What do you know about that? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=211.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. The United Kingdom is now also joining the United States [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=218.46s)]
*  in temporarily pausing funding to UNRA, which is the main agency responsible [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=222.02s)]
*  for Palestinian refugees. But they have been playing, of course, a critical [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=227.46s)]
*  role in Gaza right now, providing shelter, providing food and other [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=230.70000000000002s)]
*  humanitarian assistance that is so desperately needed at this moment. But [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=235.10000000000002s)]
*  of course, this all comes after these bombshell allegations yesterday that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=238.94s)]
*  12 on Russ staffers were involved in the October 7 terrorist attacks carried [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=243.06s)]
*  out by Hamas. That's according to intelligence that Israel shared not only [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=250.54s)]
*  with the United States, but also with UNRA directly. And following that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=254.46s)]
*  information, UNRA went on to fire some of those staffers. We don't know [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=258.3s)]
*  exactly how many, but they they did say that they fired multiple staffers in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=263.94s)]
*  part because they want to ensure that humanitarian assistance can continue to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=269.22s)]
*  flow into Gaza. Unruh, for its part, has pledged a full investigation into this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=273.66s)]
*  matter and has vowed to hold any of those responsible accountable for this. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=278.02s)]
*  But today we're also getting reaction from Hamas, which is condemning Israel's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=281.82s)]
*  threats against that U. N. Agency. Israel has said that they would like [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=286.12s)]
*  to end on Roswell in Gaza altogether and is calling on countries to end [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=291.4s)]
*  funding to that agency. Fred. All right, Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much for [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=295.7s)]
*  your reporting. All right. In Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent Society is [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=300.14s)]
*  appealing for protection for the L Amal Hospital in Hunyunis in Gaza. The aid [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=306.26s)]
*  agency says Israeli bombing in the area has endangered its medical staff and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=311.09999999999997s)]
*  the 7000 people who are taking shelter there separately. At least nine people [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=315.78s)]
*  were killed and another 75 injured this week when Israeli tank fire hit the U. N. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=320.7s)]
*  Shelter that was harboring hundreds of people. That's according to the U. N. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=325.94s)]
*  Streams of Palestinians fled the area in southern Gaza following the attack. The [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=330.42s)]
*  Israeli military said it is looking into the incident and said it wasn't the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=335.82s)]
*  result of a strike by Israeli forces. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=340.86s)]
*  I want to bring in a Jada McKenna. She is the CEO of Mercy Corps. Uh, so good [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=345.58s)]
*  to see you. So there's an aid organization that has been working in [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=351.5s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank for more than 30 years. What? What have your aid workers [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=354.9s)]
*  been telling you about the attack on the shelter and the aftermath? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=360.34s)]
*  You know, increasingly, Palestinians have been moved into smaller and smaller [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=364.42s)]
*  spaces. Um, and for this to happen, it's just another example where there are [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=370.1s)]
*  very few places for them physically to be and to see them continually getting [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=374.22s)]
*  bombed. It just escalates this feeling that nowhere is safe and the anxiety [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=378.98s)]
*  of the hardship of living amidst a war situation after the attack. You know, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=383.54s)]
*  you reiterated that Gazans are trapped. They have nowhere to go. And the same [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=388.46000000000004s)]
*  applies to some of your aid workers. Um, what are they doing to try to stay [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=392.74s)]
*  safe? And how are you able to communicate with people? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=398.18s)]
*  So we some some of them have, you know, different SIM cards from other [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=401.82s)]
*  countries to get around telecoms plants because the Israel, I mean, Israel has [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=405.82s)]
*  shut down telecommunications for for weeks or days at a time at times. You [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=410.02s)]
*  know, they talk about spending a lot of time each day looking for food. They [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=414.94s)]
*  talk about fretting over safe shelter. Um, they try to get word about their [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=418.94s)]
*  relatives and others and they're also just complain. They're also starting to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  get sick. I have one staff member who said everyone in her family has either [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=429.06s)]
*  skin infection or some other kind of infection. So this prolonged period [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=433.06s)]
*  harsh winter weather with no safe shelter, not enough water, not enough [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=438.46s)]
*  food. It's taking its toll on people in many different dimensions. You are [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=443.58s)]
*  among many who have called for an immediate ceasefire, something you've [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=448.5s)]
*  been demanding for some time now. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=452.34s)]
*  Do you feel like your plea and that of many is even being heard? Um, or do you [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=455.78s)]
*  believe that at some point there will be a ceasefire if it doesn't happen [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=464.46s)]
*  happen more immediately? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=468.84s)]
*  It's very disheartening. And you know, at this point, all all two million [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=472.54s)]
*  people of Gaza are in need of humanitarian aid to launch a response [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=477.42s)]
*  and to serve that many people. That is something outside of the purview of eight [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=482.26s)]
*  organizations. There is no way for us to do that safely in the absence of a [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=486.38s)]
*  total ceasefire. People won't know where to go for safety. Our staff will be at [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=491.70000000000005s)]
*  risk and it will be chaotic. So it's really disheartening that our pleas for [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  this have been unheard because the longer this goes on, the more that is an [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=500.5s)]
*  absolute precondition for anything. And you say one of the things that hampers [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=505.58s)]
*  your organization is a lack of access, you know, lack of access points, you [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=510.58s)]
*  know, for for Gaza aid. Um, can you kind of paint a picture for people who still [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=514.5s)]
*  have a hard time envisioning, you know what these obstacles are? Uh, and in [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=520.5799999999999s)]
*  what ways can aid be rendered rendered? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  So just to start with getting supplies in on a normal Gaza was always [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=531.38s)]
*  dependent on those crossings for all of their commercial goods and everything [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=535.62s)]
*  else. So on a normal day, 500 trucks, including like regular grocery store [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=539.62s)]
*  restocking would go through the Gaza to go into Gaza every day. At this point, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=543.98s)]
*  we're averaging about 130 trucks a day, just of aid, not of any commercial [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=549.34s)]
*  things. There are hundreds of trucks lined up at the Egyptian border. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=555.18s)]
*  Some items have been indiscriminately banned from those trucks. So sleeping [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=559.3s)]
*  bags were rejected for having metal zippers. Tents were respected for were [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=564.18s)]
*  rejected for having metal poles. So a truck gets that inspection station. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=569.14s)]
*  Something gets disqualified and then they have to go all the way to the back [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=573.34s)]
*  of the line. On top of that, where are we as aid workers to tell people to go to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=577.06s)]
*  collect aid? Earlier in your segment, you talked about a U. N shelter getting [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=581.98s)]
*  bombed. You have a hospital getting bombed. Where do we feel comfortable [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=587.02s)]
*  telling people that they can go and be safe to get these supplies? So people [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=590.5s)]
*  are so desperate, they're even mobbing the trucks that are coming in, but we [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=595.26s)]
*  just have no visibility to how we safely transport because areas that should [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKoVfMVLk7A&t=599.0999999999999s)]
