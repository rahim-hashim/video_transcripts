# Cousin of hostage killed by Hamas: Netanyahu's decisions made it impossible for hostages to return
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM)
*  Now, the cousin of Kamel Gad, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=0.0s)]
*  one of the hostages found dead in Gaza on Saturday, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=2.12s)]
*  penned an emotional tribute for her on Sunday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=5.16s)]
*  Gil Dickman posted on X saying, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=8.68s)]
*  "'Sorry, Kamelie. Sorry we didn't stop when it was still possible. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=10.88s)]
*  "'Sorry, we let them kill you.'" [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=14.64s)]
*  He also said, "'I wish you saw how your friends [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=16.96s)]
*  "'fought to bring you back alive.'" [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=19.6s)]
*  He also wrote that, "'I wish that in your memory [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=21.76s)]
*  "'thousands would come out to demonstrate tonight [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  "'just as I would have done, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=26.64s)]
*  "'as you would have done.'" [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=28.88s)]
*  40-year-old Gad was taken hostage by Hamas on October 7th [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=30.8s)]
*  while staying at her parents' home. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=34.32s)]
*  And Gil Dickman joins me now live from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=37.24s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=43.4s)]
*  And can I first begin by saying how sorry I am, Gil, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=45.28s)]
*  for your loss and sorry, too, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=49.24s)]
*  for the suffering that your family has been through [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=51.68s)]
*  for the past 11 months only for it to end this way? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, thank you very, very much. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=58.08s)]
*  We can't really believe that this is how it ends. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=60.72s)]
*  We didn't want it to end like this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  We wanted another ending for this horrible story. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=65.52s)]
*  You know, Kamel wasn't the only hostage from the family. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=68.72s)]
*  Her mother was murdered on October 7th by the terrorists, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=73.28s)]
*  and her sister-in-law, Yarden Roman, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=77.16s)]
*  was also taken hostage. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=80.32s)]
*  And she was returned. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=82.12s)]
*  She was brought back home on the 54th day of the war [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=84.44s)]
*  thanks to a ceasefire that was signed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=88.16s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=90.72s)]
*  And we really hoped that a very similar ceasefire [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=93.16s)]
*  would be signed between the two sides. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=97.55999999999999s)]
*  But we found out that it was very, very hard [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  to bring the two sides to sign the deal. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=103.6s)]
*  Hamas is a terror organization. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=106.96s)]
*  I have no expectations from this horrible, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=108.75999999999999s)]
*  this horrible figure, Yechessin Wah, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  to sign the deal that will actually bring my cousin home. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=115.72s)]
*  But we know that Hamas has agreed to a deal at some point, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  and Israel was the one putting on more and more terms [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=124.32s)]
*  and actually postponing the deal. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=128.04s)]
*  And right now we know the decisions [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=130.12s)]
*  that our Prime Minister, Netanyahu, has made. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=132.16s)]
*  Made it impossible for Kamel and other hostages to return [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  and put their lives in great danger. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=139.56s)]
*  That's what killed them. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=142.48s)]
*  Hamas has said that the hostages would be alive [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  if it weren't for the actions of the Israeli government. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Who do you blame, Gil, for the death of Kamel? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=151.92s)]
*  This blame game is a game to me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  And when I'm here for life and death, it's no game. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=161.72s)]
*  It's both sides who are to blame. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  It's first of all the terror organization who took her. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=168.48s)]
*  And all of the hostages, they shouldn't have taken her. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=172.2s)]
*  She is an innocent, an innocent civilian, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=174.04s)]
*  and she wasn't supposed to be taken in the first place. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=178.8s)]
*  A 40-year-old woman not related in any way to, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=182.2s)]
*  not to the army and not to anything else. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=186.28s)]
*  She was supposed to be at home with her family, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=188.44s)]
*  and she was taken just like kids [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=191.12s)]
*  and other innocent people were taken. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=193.96s)]
*  And I blame, of course I blame Hamas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=196.96s)]
*  And I also blame my government [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=200.84s)]
*  because these are the people that should be in charge [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=203.44s)]
*  of the security and the peace of people in Israel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=209.56s)]
*  These are the people who are supposed to be responsible [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  for the life of people here. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=219.44s)]
*  And they were responsible for the lives of all the hostages. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=221.72000000000003s)]
*  And they decided cold-bloodedly, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=225.12s)]
*  they voted just a few days ago [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=227.16000000000003s)]
*  that the Philadelphia, the border between Gaza and Egypt [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=229.56s)]
*  is more important than the lives of the hostages. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=235.44s)]
*  And that means that our government decided [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=239.24s)]
*  that they're willing to sacrifice the lives of the hostages. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=242.96s)]
*  They all voted, the cabinet voted for it, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=246.6s)]
*  and we were shocked. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=250.2s)]
*  And we said, me and my sister and all my family [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=251.76s)]
*  and all the families of all the hostages, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=254.72s)]
*  we said, this is crossing the red line. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=256.44s)]
*  And that would mean the death of hostages. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=259.0s)]
*  And saying this, I did not know how true it will be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=262.16s)]
*  and how specific and personal it is going to become. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=266.2s)]
*  And it was Karmel, it could have been anyone else, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=269.84s)]
*  but it was Karmel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=273.88s)]
*  And the lives of all the other hostages are still in danger. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=274.92s)]
*  So we must act now. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=278.48s)]
*  The Israeli government and the Israeli people, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=280.4s)]
*  the Israeli people chose to act. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=282.64s)]
*  They came out to the streets last night [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=284.2s)]
*  and they're out in the streets right now. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=286.72s)]
*  And it's very moving. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=289.04s)]
*  Sorry that we had to go through this horrible, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=290.8s)]
*  horrible situation in order for them to get out, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=293.6s)]
*  but they did. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=295.96s)]
*  And I really hope that the government, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=296.8s)]
*  our government will make the right decision [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  and push for a deal that'll bring the hostages home. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=301.16s)]
*  It's been too long. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=304.6s)]
*  And that was what you were calling for [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  in your tribute to Karmel Gill. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=307.64s)]
*  You were calling on people to come out [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=309.24s)]
*  and demonstrate in her memory. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=311.44s)]
*  And they have done that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=313.12s)]
*  We've seen tens of thousands of people take to the streets. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=314.36s)]
*  We're reporting on nationwide protests, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=317.6s)]
*  nationwide strike today. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=320.16s)]
*  Do you feel that this is a turning point [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=321.92s)]
*  we're witnessing here? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=325.04s)]
*  I really hope that this is the turning point [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=327.88s)]
*  or breaking point or some kind of a change in reality, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=330.2s)]
*  which will maybe, maybe help the government [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=335.64s)]
*  make the right decision. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=338.36s)]
*  But if it's just a one-time thing, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=339.88s)]
*  it was reported to be the largest protest or demonstration [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=343.8s)]
*  in the history of Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=347.72s)]
*  This is very moving. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=348.88s)]
*  And I know that Karmel can't see this, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  but I know that's exactly what she would've wanted [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  for people to come out and to demand the release [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=355.24s)]
*  of the other hostages. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  It's too late for her, but it's not too late for them. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=360.44s)]
*  And I hope that they're not, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=363.48s)]
*  that the government is not just going to look away [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=365.88s)]
*  and to choose death over life, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  because this is not what we believe here in Israel. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=371.08s)]
*  That's not what we believe this war is about. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=373.64s)]
*  You're giving a lot of air time to this war [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=377.35999999999996s)]
*  because of things that are going on [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=380.52s)]
*  on both sides of the border. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=381.76s)]
*  People think it's Israel versus Palestine [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  or Jews versus Muslims. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=385.56s)]
*  This is and has always been a fight [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  between people who believe in life and who choose life [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=390.24s)]
*  and who choose a ceasefire that'll bring the hostages home [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=393.32s)]
*  over the people who believe in death and choose death. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=396.76s)]
*  And I know that the organization that kidnapped Karmel [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=400.20000000000005s)]
*  and that murdered her mother chose death. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=403.72s)]
*  They believe that death is sacred, but I can't believe, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=406.68s)]
*  I still can't believe that my government chose death. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=410.56s)]
*  And I urge you, Benjamin Netanyahu, choose life. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=413.48s)]
*  Please sign the deal, seal the deal, go to ceasefire [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  and save the hostages that you can still save. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=421.48s)]
*  I understand that you, your family, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=424.92s)]
*  had a chance to speak to the president over the weekend [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  that he reached out to you and wanted to talk, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=431.0s)]
*  but you refused. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=434.64000000000004s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  And what do you make of Benjamin Netanyahu's actions [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=437.24s)]
*  in all of this? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=441.24s)]
*  Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu has made it public [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  that he's going to approach the families [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  in order to speak to them. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=449.12s)]
*  Then he decided that he gave us the message [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=450.8s)]
*  that he wants to speak to us. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=454.20000000000005s)]
*  We don't want to be a part of this media circus [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=455.8s)]
*  of the Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=459.56s)]
*  who's now using the murder of the hostages [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=461.84000000000003s)]
*  in order to justify staying there and not getting out [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=466.76s)]
*  and going to a ceasefire and signing a deal, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=471.68s)]
*  which is unbelievable to me. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=474.48s)]
*  He's trying to use this, saying, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  if you murdered the hostages, you don't want the deal. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=478.36s)]
*  And I didn't want to take part in this. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=481.68s)]
*  We didn't want to take part in this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=484.12s)]
*  The family, Kamel's family, believe that the Prime Minister [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=485.92s)]
*  of Israel is responsible for her death. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=489.64s)]
*  He is her killer. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=494.64s)]
*  That's the fact. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=496.6s)]
*  He didn't pull the trigger, but he left her there, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=497.72s)]
*  knowing that that means she's in life danger, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=501.0s)]
*  death danger. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=505.48s)]
*  And knowing these risks, this is actually, it's killing. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=506.88s)]
*  And we don't want to talk to him. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=512.4s)]
*  And I don't feel like he could be convinced [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=515.4399999999999s)]
*  by a conversation heart to heart. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=520.64s)]
*  I spoke to him, I saw him and how he reacted [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=523.08s)]
*  to hostages who came back from captivity [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=528.28s)]
*  and spoke about what they went through there. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=530.76s)]
*  It doesn't look like it moved him. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't feel like his heart is open [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=535.72s)]
*  to this kind of conversation. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=538.08s)]
*  I think we only understand the language of politics. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=539.92s)]
*  That's maybe something that happens to you [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=543.4s)]
*  after so many years in your job. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=545.24s)]
*  Everything becomes politics. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  Even the life and death of people becomes pure math [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=551.1999999999999s)]
*  of whether it will bring me more support or less support, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=556.3199999999999s)]
*  where it would let him stay in power or lose power. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  And if that's what it is, then that's the language [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  that we should speak to him, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=567.52s)]
*  which must go out to the streets [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=568.76s)]
*  and protest in our democratic way. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=570.64s)]
*  And this is not an anti-Israeli thing to do. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=573.04s)]
*  The exact opposite. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=576.28s)]
*  This is the most Israeli thing to do. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=577.56s)]
*  We came out with Israeli flags [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=579.64s)]
*  and with hostages' yellow flags [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=582.28s)]
*  to tell him the democratic thing to do [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=584.48s)]
*  if you want to stay in power, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=587.28s)]
*  if you want to have any legitimacy to act in our name, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=589.04s)]
*  save their lives and sign the deal now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLMDQSzUzRM&t=594.28s)]
