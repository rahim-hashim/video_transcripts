# Benjamin Netanyahu disbands Israeli war cabinet
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg)
*  An Israeli official says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has disbanded the war cabinet, which [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=0.0s)]
*  was responsible for key decisions relating to the Israel-Hamas war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=5.76s)]
*  It was formed in the days after the October 7th Hamas attacks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=11.08s)]
*  The decision comes after opposition leader Benny Gantz withdrew from the body last week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=15.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel's military announced a daily tactical pause along a specific route and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=20.92s)]
*  specific times to allow for humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=27.04s)]
*  The IDF later clarified that its troops are still fighting in Rafa and parts of Gaza. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=31.68s)]
*  CNN's Paula Hancocks is joining us now from southern Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=37.92s)]
*  Paula, let's start with Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to disband his war cabinet. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=41.76s)]
*  What's behind that decision? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, Amara, in the war cabinet, there were always three men who were basically making [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=49.2s)]
*  the decisions, which was the prime minister, the defence minister and the opposition leader, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  Benny Gantz. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=60.44s)]
*  Now, of course, since Gantz has resigned, saying he's in protest of the fact there's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=61.44s)]
*  no plan to get the hostages out, no day after plan for Gaza and not a plan to get people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=65.8s)]
*  back to northern Israel as well who've been evacuated, it is now effectively a two-person [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=71.88s)]
*  war cabinet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=77.0s)]
*  So what he has done is he's disbanded that and he has said, according to an official [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=78.0s)]
*  in his office, that the decisions when it comes to the war in Gaza will be made on a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=82.2s)]
*  security cabinet basis, which is a wider cabinet basis. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=88.2s)]
*  Also, saying that, or experts are saying, that this kind of avoids the pressure that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=92.92s)]
*  was coming from the far right of his coalition. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=100.12s)]
*  Some of those far right elements wanted to be part of the war cabinet. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  So by disbanding it, potentially he has got rid of that problem as well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=106.84s)]
*  He doesn't have to accept or reject them because he does have a balancing act when it comes [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=111.2s)]
*  to his coalition at this point. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=115.2s)]
*  But they do say within the prime minister's office this won't make a difference to actually [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=117.64s)]
*  making the decisions on the war in Gaza. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  And if they have to, they will have smaller groups to decide tactical changes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=125.36s)]
*  Amara? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=129.72s)]
*  And regarding that tactical pause, if there is still fighting going on in Rafa and parts [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=130.72s)]
*  of Gaza, as the IDF says, is this tactical pause in effect to allow humanitarian aid in? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=136.68s)]
*  So this is a pause that comes from the Kerem Shalom crossing where we just were, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=145.24s)]
*  and it goes into Gaza and then up the Salah Hadin Road, which is effectively the north-south [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  road that runs through Gaza. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  Now, from the IDF's point of view, they say that they are securing that road so it will be safe [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  for international aid organisations to distribute aid, which they say is stuck on the Gaza side [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=164.04s)]
*  of the Kerem Shalom border. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=171.08s)]
*  They say there's more than 1,000 trucks that are there currently. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=172.68s)]
*  But we've spoken to some of those aid groups, including the UN groups in Gaza, and they say [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=175.96s)]
*  that sometimes it is simply too dangerous for them to be able to get to that crossing and pick up [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=180.84s)]
*  the aid. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  It's not just the fighting that they're concerned about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=187.4s)]
*  It's also the sense of lawlessness in Gaza. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=189.96s)]
*  There is a lot of looting. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=193.56s)]
*  They say it's very dangerous for them to be able to try and distribute the aid. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=195.16s)]
*  I did ask the IDF spokesperson if there would be some kind of military escort with these trucks [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=199.08s)]
*  to try and get the aid in, and that was not answered. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=205.88s)]
*  So at this point, it doesn't appear that that would be the case. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  We've also heard from the Gaza media office saying that as far as they're concerned, there's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  been no tactical pause. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=215.88s)]
*  So they believe that it is Israeli lies in their words. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=217.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, the IDF has been quite clear that the fighting will continue. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=223.0s)]
*  It will continue in Raqqa, which is very close to where this route is for the tactical pause, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=226.44s)]
*  as they will be continuing what they have been doing since last month. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=233.4s)]
*  Amara? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=237.88s)]
*  AMNA NAWAZAN [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  This is Amara. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Paula. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=242.11999999999998s)]
*  Meanwhile, a U.S. special envoy arrives in Israel Monday, as tensions escalate on Israel's [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  northern border with Lebanon. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=248.27999999999997s)]
*  CNN's Ben Wideman is joining us now live from Beirut. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=250.6s)]
*  But U.N. officials are warning that there is a very real danger of miscalculation [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=255.0s)]
*  escalating the conflict along the Israel and Lebanon's border. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=260.76s)]
*  What have you learned? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=265.32s)]
*  BEN WIDMAN, U.N. Secretary of State for Israel and Lebanon [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=266.12s)]
*  What we have been seeing is that, certainly in the last few weeks, things on the border [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=269.08s)]
*  have gotten much hotter in terms of the daily back and forth between Hezbollah and Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=273.96s)]
*  Although I must add that it's currently a Muslim holiday, and yesterday, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=280.04s)]
*  on the at least from Hezbollah's side, they didn't fire anything at the Israelis, as far [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  as we can tell. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=290.04s)]
*  But this envoy, Amos Hochstein, who is the senior energy adviser at the White House, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=290.92s)]
*  and he's really the point man in dealing with sort of the Lebanon-Israel file for the United [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=295.64s)]
*  States, he's in Israel now. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=302.12s)]
*  We assume, although it has not been officially announced, that he's going to be coming [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=304.28s)]
*  to Beirut in the coming days. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=308.68s)]
*  Nonetheless, what is obvious, certainly from statements made by senior Israeli officials, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the signs we're getting from Hezbollah, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=318.52s)]
*  is that both sides are primed for escalation. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=324.12s)]
*  Every day, the message goes out from south Lebanon in slick propaganda videos accompanied [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  by a stirring soundtrack. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=337.8s)]
*  Hezbollah is ready to go from daily skirmishes to full-scale war with Israel. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=340.6s)]
*  Meierd in what appears to be an unwinnable war in Gaza, Israel has vowed to turn its [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=346.36s)]
*  military might on Hezbollah. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=353.88s)]
*  Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the border, saying, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=356.92s)]
*  we are prepared for very strong action in the north. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  But the Iranian-backed group is by far the most formidable, battle-hardened foe Israel [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=366.2s)]
*  has faced on its borders since the 1973 October War. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=376.68s)]
*  After its guerrillas forced Israel to pull out of south Lebanon 24 years ago, in 2006 [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah fought Israel to a standstill. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=389.64s)]
*  Although the war left parts of Beirut and much of southern Lebanon in ruins. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=393.23999999999995s)]
*  Retired Lebanese Army Brigadier General Elias Hanna knows the militant group well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=400.11999999999995s)]
*  Hezbollah is an exclusive club, well-disciplined, monitored, and they have, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=406.59999999999997s)]
*  which is the most important issue, a charismatic leader, Sayed Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  Since October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=418.91999999999996s)]
*  including last week, high-ranking commander Taleb Abdullah, given a hero's farewell in Beirut. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=423.64s)]
*  At the funeral, senior Hezbollah leader Hashem Safiadeen warned, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=431.4s)]
*  we will increase our operations in intensity and force, in quantity and quality. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=436.2s)]
*  Analysts believe Iran has provided Hezbollah with an arsenal of sophisticated long-range [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=441.24s)]
*  missiles capable of reaching Tel Aviv and beyond. Until now, Hezbollah has mostly [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=451.32s)]
*  limited its strikes to military targets along the rugged mountainous frontier, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=459.08s)]
*  hitting Israel's extensive network of surveillance posts. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  It also says it has taken out an Iron Dome battery, the backbone of Israel's missile defenses, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=469.32000000000005s)]
*  and has used ground-to-air missiles to shoot down three top-of-the-line Hermes 900 drones, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=475.32000000000005s)]
*  in the process forcing tens of thousands of Israelis to flee their homes in the north. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=484.20000000000005s)]
*  Hezbollah is learning faster than Israel can adapt, says Hanna. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=490.6s)]
*  You know, they are learning. It's like learning process. It's like trial and error. So, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=495.08s)]
*  as far as you go in time, you are seeing more intensity, more combined use of weapon, and then [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=500.59999999999997s)]
*  more in-depth and more in effectiveness against the Israelis. And what is the problem? That the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=510.28s)]
*  Israelis have no answer for that. Since October, Israel has bolstered its forces on the border [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=515.64s)]
*  and held exercises to prepare for war. Hezbollah is also ready for war, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=522.52s)]
*  a war that is just one miscalculation away. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=529.16s)]
*  Now, Mr. Hochstein is probably trying to convince the Israelis now is not a good time, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=536.4399999999999s)]
*  given the situation in Gaza, to jump into a war with Lebanon. And, of course, in Lebanon, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=542.68s)]
*  given Hezbollah's strength and abilities to strike well inside Israel, the price for Israel [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=549.72s)]
*  would be very high. But Prime Minister Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the public in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=556.2s)]
*  Israel to allow those people who fled the north to go back home. So, they're really in a bind. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=562.52s)]
*  Now, the one solution on what has been seen before is that, in late November of last year, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=570.0400000000001s)]
*  when there was an eight-day halt in the fighting in Gaza and there was a release of hostages in [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=576.04s)]
*  exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees, the border along between Lebanon and Israel was [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=582.28s)]
*  quiet. Hezbollah's made it clear, if the fighting stops in Gaza, the border will be quiet. So, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=589.88s)]
*  probably a ceasefire is the best solution all around. Amara? Ben Wiedemann and Beirut for us, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=596.28s)]
*  thank you so much. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRQaFxADQjg&t=603.0s)]
