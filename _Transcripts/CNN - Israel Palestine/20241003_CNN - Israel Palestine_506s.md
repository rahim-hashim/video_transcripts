# See where Israel may strike in Iran, and hear how Iran will defend themselves
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM)
*  I want to go to Jomana because she's in Beirut and that's where the the bounding has been so relentless. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=0.0s)]
*  Jomana, when we show those images that Nick and I are looking at of the skies behind you that you are actually standing there seeing and hearing, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=5.2s)]
*  what do you even know about the target of these strikes and how relentless do they feel? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=12.32s)]
*  Well, you know, Erin, a couple of hours ago, you had these massive strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut that our team here witnessed the state news agency saying that there were about 10 consecutive strikes describing them as some of the biggest since the start of the war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=22.64s)]
*  Now, our colleague Jeremy Diamond is told by an Israeli official that the target of that strike was Hashem Safiadeen, one of the top commanders of Hezbollah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=39.84s)]
*  He was seen as a successor for Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, who was killed in an Israeli strike last Friday. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Now, it's unclear right now if Safiadeen was killed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=60.8s)]
*  We have not heard from Hezbollah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=65.12s)]
*  We know that the Israelis will need time to make that assessment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=67.2s)]
*  But, you know, it's really notable, Erin. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=72.32s)]
*  It's been tomorrow, marks a week since Nasrallah was killed. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  No successor has been named and his funeral has not yet been held. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=78.16s)]
*  The leadership, the command structure of Hezbollah has been decimated in a matter of days. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=83.36s)]
*  And there's been many questions about their capabilities right now. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=90.64s)]
*  But, you know, as you were showing there earlier, they are still carrying out attacks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=94.6s)]
*  Hezbollah today claiming that they carried out 32 attacks, they say, on Israeli forces. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=99.24s)]
*  Those trying to make advances, according to Hezbollah, they say that they were trying to make advances into southern Lebanon, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=105.12s)]
*  as well as carrying out attacks across the border as well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=111.24s)]
*  I mean, in the past 24 hours, Erin, we have seen real intensification in Israeli bombardment here in Beirut, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  and as well as in southern Lebanon and in the east of the country as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=124.32s)]
*  And clearly, from what we have seen, it has had a devastating impact on Hezbollah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=130.0s)]
*  They have hit Hezbollah targets. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=136.68s)]
*  But at the same time, it's also having a devastating impact on the civilians in the country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=138.68s)]
*  The death toll continuing to rise. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=143.52s)]
*  More than a million people displaced in a matter of days. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  And as you mentioned, we've had the Israeli military's Arabic language spokesperson in the last few hours [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=149.72s)]
*  putting out multiple evacuation orders for different neighborhoods in the southern suburbs, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=156.84s)]
*  including one where you have a hospital, the Sant Tere's Hospital, which is within one of those evacuation zones, Erin. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=162.84s)]
*  All right, Jamana, obviously, incredibly tense and for many a dire situation in Lebanon tonight. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=172.8s)]
*  Thank you very much. Jamana is live in Beirut. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  She continues to be up because as we have seen over these hours and last night in these hours when, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=183.96s)]
*  if anyone who was watching here, there were drones that the Houthis have taken credit for at this point, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=189.0s)]
*  responsibility for just exploding off the coast of where we are in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=194.64s)]
*  Jonathan Konrikis is with me now here in Tel Aviv, former spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=198.32s)]
*  And Jonathan, we are in this moment where the escalation, the relentlessness in the north, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=204.32s)]
*  the conflict continues in Gaza. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=210.44s)]
*  You have strikes in the West Bank. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=211.88s)]
*  You have Israel making a decision on exactly what it is going to hit in Iran. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=213.16s)]
*  This is not an if. This is a what. And it is a when. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=217.92s)]
*  You obviously have been in the IDF throughout the war. You were there on October 7th. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=221.0s)]
*  So I know you've got some maps of what you think exactly could be happening here in these next hours [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  of where Israel could choose to strike. What's first? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=230.12s)]
*  Well, first of all, as you say, I think it's a matter of when and where and how strong and in what order. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=233.88s)]
*  And this is based, the maps that we're seeing is based on the experts at FDD, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=242.04s)]
*  Benham Bentaleblu, Andrea Stricker, Saeed Gassiminejad and Mark Dubovitz, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=246.92s)]
*  and the FDD Visual Intelligence Team. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=251.92s)]
*  What we've done is to analyze, first and foremost, the military infrastructure that Iran has in place, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=254.56s)]
*  which probably will be the first target of an Israeli attack. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=260.48s)]
*  There are specific bases where the assessment is that most of the rockets, the 180 missiles that were fired. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  On Tuesday, here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=272.88s)]
*  Exactly. They were fired from specific bases in Iran towards Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=273.72s)]
*  Those are the Arak and Isfahan and Imam Ali bases. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=278.64s)]
*  And I think it's fair to assume that there will be some kind of issue with striking those first. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  Those three. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=288.44s)]
*  Those three, because that is where they struck from. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=289.32s)]
*  Important to mention that the Iranians do have air defenses. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=292.36s)]
*  And in any future scenario, Israel will want to take care of those air defenses in order to facilitate other attacks. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=295.4s)]
*  Are they confident they can do that? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=303.36s)]
*  Because one thing they don't or that you don't want to have happen is what happened to the Iranians, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=304.64s)]
*  I mean, a lot of things came through, but they didn't hit the targets. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=309.96s)]
*  They didn't do massive destruction everywhere. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=312.24s)]
*  Israel can't afford for that to be the outcome of what you do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=315.44s)]
*  No, no, no. And that's not how Israel operates. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  That's also one of the differences between having a plane with the pilot and fifth generation capabilities [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=319.92s)]
*  versus a missile that is fired from hundreds of kilometers away and only has limited ability to actually pinpoint the strike. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=326.08s)]
*  When there's a pilot in the cockpit and very good intel, the chances of striking, yes, are much higher. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=333.92s)]
*  All right. So you talk about those three sites where the missiles were launched from that you think there would definitely be strikes there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=339.56s)]
*  Right. President Biden, we heard a moment ago say he's open to strikes on oil facilities. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=344.48s)]
*  Some believe that that's deeply escalatory, but I know you believe that should be on the table. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  And you have gone through specific infrastructure that you think right now, if you're in the Israeli war cabinet, that they are targeting for this strike. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=353.16s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, what we're talking about is there's about 14 major oil refineries and oil related locations spread all over Iran. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  Some of them are most of them, of course, along the sea. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=370.88s)]
*  That is where they export from. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=375.32s)]
*  Many people are familiar with Hajj in the western part of the coast and, of course, Bandar Abbas. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=376.8s)]
*  But there's many other locations that are very vital to the economy of the Islamic Republic. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=384.32s)]
*  But if you look at Tehran and you can see the really the abundance of important regime targets in Tehran, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=391.84000000000003s)]
*  we're talking about, you know, the Supreme Leader's office where he runs Iran from the Ministry of Defense, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=399.32s)]
*  the intelligence security, which is where they do internal oppression and external operations from the IRGC and many other locations. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=405.88s)]
*  So I would look very strongly at Tehran. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=414.32s)]
*  The Supreme Leader does his work and rules the country from if Israel strikes that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=417.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=422.67999999999995s)]
*  Many hear that and say, OK, that that is a whole new thing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=423.2s)]
*  Is that is that do you telegraph ahead so you make sure he's not there? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, what do you how would you suggest something like that? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  So that very executed. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=434.8s)]
*  Yeah. So that very much depends on what Israel wants to achieve, what strategy Israel has and what the end game is. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=436.12s)]
*  If Israel only wants to deal Iran a severe military blow, then the first slide we spoke about military targets that will send that message. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=443.48s)]
*  If Israel wants to go further. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=451.6s)]
*  And many say that this is the best opportunity that Israel will have. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=453.36s)]
*  They say go for the nuclear facilities. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=457.16s)]
*  Go for the nuclear or go for regime. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=458.64s)]
*  And Israel has collected a lot of intelligence over the years. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=461.4s)]
*  It has, I think, a very good understanding of where the targets are in terms of nuclear sites. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=464.76s)]
*  It becomes a little bit more complex with the nuclear sites because if Israel there's a lot of sites there, there's about 15 sites. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  But there's four specific sites that are new and probably more related to weaponization. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=476.64s)]
*  Foreign experts, they indicate that they have enough fissile material for 15 bombs already. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=482.92s)]
*  So it's kind of a double edged sword. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=489.48s)]
*  But bottom line, where we really are now, this could happen in a matter of days. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=490.84s)]
*  And I think that there's an abundance of targets. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=495.08s)]
*  We'll see what Israel decides to do. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=498.12s)]
*  Well, days and hours. And as we have learned, they know where people are. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=499.36s)]
*  If they want to take out individuals, they can. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=501.8s)]
*  It is a decision that will impact the whole world. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q46fhkpLKfM&t=503.68s)]
