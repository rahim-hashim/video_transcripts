# IDF spokesman says military working with officials to evacuate remaining hospital patients
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs)
*  IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrikis joins us now from Tel Aviv. Colonel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=0.0s)]
*  thanks very much. I want to ask you about what's taking place right now with the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=5.12s)]
*  What can you tell us about what's being done to make sure some of these innocent civilians [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=10.08s)]
*  can get out of there, the babies that have been talked about and so on? What is going on there [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=15.6s)]
*  with this hospital? What can you share? Hi Jim, thank you for having me. We are on day 36 of the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  war and 239 Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza. Regarding the hospital, we are in contact [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=28.16s)]
*  with local authorities in Gaza with the manager and others and assisting them and informing them [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  where they can go in order to evacuate from the area and we are also trying to coordinate the safe [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=44.64s)]
*  removal and transport of the remaining patients that are still inside the hospital. I want to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=51.92s)]
*  emphasize we haven't struck the hospital and we are not surrounding it or applying any pressure [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  on it. We have troops in the vicinity but we have not been engaging with the hospital or any parts of it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=64.88s)]
*  And so I guess maybe you can help us clear this up. Why is it that the health ministry there [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=73.28s)]
*  claims that the hospital is completely surrounded? We've also heard from a spokesperson from the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=78.24s)]
*  Israeli military, I guess one of your counterparts, that a wing of that hospital is still open for [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=85.2s)]
*  people to safely evacuate. Help us sort that out. What's going on? Yeah, indeed. That is what we've [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=89.76s)]
*  told the Palestinians as well, that the eastern wing is open and that all of the people that are [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=96.4s)]
*  there, the displaced persons that have been seeking shelter as well as others who are in the compound [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=103.84s)]
*  can move safely and we have instructed them even by the names of streets and locations [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=109.92s)]
*  where they should go when we will do the next humanitarian window. As you know, we've been [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=115.28s)]
*  doing that for the last five days in various locations in the Gaza Strip where we've been [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=121.04s)]
*  stopping our fire, calling Palestinians and telling them to evacuate. The main road is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=127.04s)]
*  Salah Hadin, the main throughfare of the Gaza Strip, but then also Al Rashid Street, the coastal [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=133.68s)]
*  road. We've opened that up as well during select hours of the day, daytime hours, which allows [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=139.12s)]
*  Palestinians to move and to go to relative safety in the south, again under our commitment not to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=146.48000000000002s)]
*  strike civilians and out of a respect for the sanctity of human life, which is much more than [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=153.76s)]
*  what Hamas is doing at this time. And so what can you tell us about these reports that we're seeing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=158.8s)]
*  about tanks surrounding the hospital? Is that happening? And are you conducting an operation [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=164.16s)]
*  in that area? I know you said in the past, Colonel, that you don't target hospitals [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=169.12s)]
*  and that sort of thing, but you've also said and others have said with the IDF that sometimes the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=173.92s)]
*  hospitals and these kinds of civilian facilities are used by Hamas for their operations. And so [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=178.56s)]
*  is there an IDF operation going on in that area to find them in and around that facility, that hospital? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=184.96s)]
*  Yeah, our troops are definitely nearby. We have troops that have approached that area from various [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=192.08s)]
*  locations. We have to understand that the viewers who may not have been following or just joining, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=199.44s)]
*  that the Shifa compound is indeed a hospital, but underneath are layers and layers of Hamas [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=205.68s)]
*  military activity that they have established underneath the hospital, whereby they are using [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=213.36s)]
*  the hospital for military needs, which is a war crime. It's against the Geneva Convention. They [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=219.12s)]
*  are endangering the protected status of the hospital by doing so. And what we have done, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=224.16s)]
*  first and foremost, is to inform the Palestinians and also the world that we know that Hamas is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=230.88s)]
*  using the hospital for military purposes. We know that it is full of Hamas combatants that are seeking [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=237.76s)]
*  shelter and trying to hide away from our forces underneath the hospital. That is also one of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=244.64s)]
*  reasons why we are trying to evacuate it, because we don't want Hamas to continue to use these people [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=250.32s)]
*  as their human shields in the future. I mean, that sounds like a very difficult and complicated [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  operation that you're trying to undertake then. What happens to the hospital at the end of all of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=263.76s)]
*  this? Does the IDF seek to control it, take it over? I mean, if you have to get at Hamas terrorists [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=269.68s)]
*  who are hiding inside tunnels underneath the hospital, one would think at some point you have [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=277.6s)]
*  to take over the hospital or take over the area around that hospital. Is that something that you're [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  seeking to do? Well, I agree with you totally that it is a very complex situation and one that we [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=288.64s)]
*  would rather not find ourselves in. But ever since October the 7th, we are in this situation [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=296.0s)]
*  where we have to fight inside Gaza and we have to strike Hamas wherever they are hiding underneath [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=301.36s)]
*  civilians in their tunnels and also underneath hospitals. And our aim is to dismantle all of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=307.84s)]
*  Hamas military infrastructure. And Hamas has embedded a significant portion of their military [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=314.4s)]
*  capabilities specifically under Shifa. And it is our aim to dismantle all of their military [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=320.96s)]
*  capabilities. I cannot go into further details about what, when, and where will be done. I can [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=326.56s)]
*  say that it would be best for everybody involved, including those who will need the hospital the day [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  after the war, for Hamas to come out of their hideings and stop abusing civilian infrastructure [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  for military purposes. If they don't, of course we will have to respond accordingly and implement [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=344.0s)]
*  our military plans. And Colonel, I'm sure you saw this, that the Secretary of State Tony Blinken, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=349.36s)]
*  of course he's a part of the Biden administration, and they've been very supportive of the Israeli [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  government, of the IDF throughout all of this. But the Secretary of State did say in the last day or [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=360.32s)]
*  so that there have been too many Palestinians killed in the Israeli operation in Gaza. What's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=365.76s)]
*  the response to that? Well, I agree that there are many people that have been killed [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=373.04s)]
*  and I am sad about civilians that have nothing to do with fighting, who are killed or wounded [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=378.8s)]
*  or displaced by fighting. That is not our goal. And I think that the Israeli government and the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=385.76s)]
*  military has been very clear and forthcoming that we are not fighting against the civilians. We try [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=390.64s)]
*  to do everything we can to get them out of the battlefield so that we can focus on fighting Hamas. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=396.8s)]
*  And I think that the government and the military, and we're talking, you know, at the military level, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=402.88s)]
*  we're communicating with our military counterparts. We're not only telling them what we're doing, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=407.52s)]
*  we're showing them what we are doing and what Hamas is doing, their violations and how they [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  are using the civilians as human shields. And we are showing what we are doing, the measures that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  we are implementing in order to minimize the damage to civilians. I definitely hope that, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, these numbers can calm down. And what we are achieving is basically we're emptying [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  northern Gaza of civilians temporarily, exactly in order to minimize and lower the amount of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=435.44s)]
*  civilian casualties. That is our aim because we seek that operational freedom to be able to go [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=442.0s)]
*  after Hamas. And Hamas is under pressure. You know, they're under pressure now. They're indicating [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=447.52s)]
*  that they're under pressure. There have been reports of them shooting at evacuees and all [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=453.04s)]
*  kinds of efforts by Hamas to stop evacuations in various locations. We understand that they're [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=457.84s)]
*  under pressure because they want these civilian casualties. Colonel, to that point, because of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=463.92s)]
*  the difficulty in dealing with these humanitarian pauses and opening them up and opening up these [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=470.48s)]
*  corridors and so on, the President of the United States, President Biden, did say in just the last [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  couple of days that he thinks that these pauses need to be longer. Are you open to that? Longer pauses? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=480.72s)]
*  Yeah, you know, already on the ground, these pauses, they have an effect on our combat [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=486.8s)]
*  rhythm and the ability to conduct our missions. Because, you know, when you apply [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=494.48s)]
*  pressure on your enemy, you want that pressure to be relentless. And the fact that we stop during [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=499.04s)]
*  many hours of the day has a price for us, a combat price. What we already have done, also responding [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=504.72s)]
*  to those requests and statements made by the President and others, is to add hours. It started [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=512.4s)]
*  with four hours and now it's five. Maybe it will be expanded more. We added another route, right? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  It was only the central route and now we've opened up a northern route as well along the coast, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=525.04s)]
*  Al Rashid Street, in addition to Salah Hadid. So we are definitely listening. We're definitely trying [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=529.68s)]
*  to find good ways of evacuating civilians, to minimize the effect on them, while still [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=536.4s)]
*  doing what we need to do. And this is important. We're not in Gaza for the amusement of it. We are [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=542.8s)]
*  there because we are fighting Hamas. They need to be dismantled. Otherwise, we won't be able to live [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=548.72s)]
*  safely in southern Israel and we need to get our hostages back. And I understand that. But [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=554.56s)]
*  you brought up hostages. One of the items that has been discussed in all of this is, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=561.52s)]
*  and you're probably aware of this, there are multiple parties involved in these kinds of talks, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=566.5600000000001s)]
*  that the longer the humanitarian pauses, potentially that could lead to the release of hostages. There [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=570.72s)]
*  have been negotiations going on to that end. Are you open to that? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=576.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not entirely sure that that is the correct working assumption. I think that what [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=581.76s)]
*  Hamas is trying to do, both its internal leadership and its overseas or external [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=586.96s)]
*  leadership, they're basically trying to play for time and they're trying to force Israel through [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=592.64s)]
*  international pressure while using the hostages, the poor women, children, babies and elderly [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=599.0400000000001s)]
*  people that they've been holding for more than 36 days. They're using them as leverage in order to [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=604.72s)]
*  get the IDF to back off and relent in our military pressure. I think that Israel has been clear, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=611.28s)]
*  there won't be any kind of ceasefire before we get hostages back. Talking can be done, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=618.24s)]
*  that's all fine, but there needs to be continuous pressure on Hamas that is the only thing that is [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=624.16s)]
*  effective. And by the way, maneuvering on the ground, creating that kind of friction on the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=629.52s)]
*  ground between us and enemy forces creates intelligence and creates other opportunities [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  that hopefully we will be able to leverage in order to get our people home. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=639.68s)]
*  Okay, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conrigas, thank you once again for your time. We appreciate it [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  this evening. Thank you. Thank you for having me. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1S3BsnflMs&t=648.4s)]
