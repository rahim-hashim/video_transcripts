# CNN presses IDF spokesperson on the ratio of civilian casualties. Hear his response
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s)
*  According to the AFP, senior Israeli military officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=0.0s)]
*  have said around two civilians have been killed [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=3.2600000000000002s)]
*  for every Hamas fighter that you have successfully killed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=5.68s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=9.88s)]
*  So that's two civilians for every terrorist. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Can you confirm that? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=15.72s)]
*  Yeah, I can confirm the report [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=19.16s)]
*  and I can say that if that is true, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=21.44s)]
*  and I think that our numbers will be corroborated, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=24.82s)]
*  if you compare that ratio to any other conflict [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=29.48s)]
*  in urban terrain between a military [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=33.76s)]
*  and a terrorist organization using civilians [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=36.8s)]
*  as their human shield and embedded [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=39.8s)]
*  in the civilian population, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  you will find that that ratio is tremendously positive [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=43.74s)]
*  and perhaps unique in the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=49.2s)]
*  I understand that there are civilian casualties [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=52.2s)]
*  and I understand that footage and coverage [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=54.84s)]
*  goes towards emotions and to cover those civilian casualties. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=56.96s)]
*  But what I want to say is that we will get those figures out [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  and they will be official and on record by the IDF [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=65.68s)]
*  with the name behind it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  And then we will be able to say [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=70.0s)]
*  and to back up afterwards with names and numbers [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=73.08s)]
*  that we are indeed targeting the terrorists. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=76.64s)]
*  We are not after the civilians [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=79.6s)]
*  and we're going into great efforts [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=81.1s)]
*  in order to keep it that way. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=83.48s)]
*  It is of course hard to comprehend two for one, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=86.16s)]
*  but when you say you're going to great efforts, Colonel, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=90.8s)]
*  one of those efforts is those IDF directions, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=93.0s)]
*  which I don't know when you actually plugged in, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=95.06s)]
*  but I had shared with anyone watching at the top of the show [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=96.88s)]
*  the directions for evacuation that you've put out. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=99.0s)]
*  Yeah, I saw what you spoke about. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=100.84s)]
*  All right, so you know there's the QR code, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  And then if you click on it, you can't right now [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=104.96s)]
*  because there's a blackout. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=107.44s)]
*  But if you were to click on it [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=108.92s)]
*  and you were to see where to go in this urban area, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=111.0s)]
*  tiny little parcels block by block, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  numbers I suppose, it's hard to even read it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  How do you really expect anybody to get that, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=120.76s)]
*  to click on it, to see it, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=124.56s)]
*  which they can't do right now again, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=126.36000000000001s)]
*  because the blackout. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=127.64s)]
*  And then to follow the directions [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  and to get somewhere safely. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=130.0s)]
*  I mean, is that reasonable? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=131.18s)]
*  I think, Aaron, that it may not be perfect, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=136.4s)]
*  but it is the best thing that we can do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=139.42000000000002s)]
*  The situation is that for weeks [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=142.72s)]
*  we have designated a humanitarian zone [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=145.16s)]
*  and we have been asking civilians to go there. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=148.36s)]
*  Unfortunately, civilians for various reasons, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=151.44s)]
*  because they're under the control of Hamas, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=154.26s)]
*  because international aid organizations [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=156.72s)]
*  have channeled them there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=158.68s)]
*  Many other reasons have not yet gone to the humanitarian zone, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=159.96s)]
*  which I think is very unfortunate. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=163.8s)]
*  The reason why we made that, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=165.6s)]
*  or designated that humanitarian zone [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=167.72s)]
*  is because it's one of the few areas [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=169.98s)]
*  where Hamas isn't embedded above and below ground, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=172.38s)]
*  and therefore a relatively safe area, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=176.17999999999998s)]
*  because we would have no interest in fighting there [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=178.38s)]
*  because Hamas isn't there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=180.88s)]
*  And that's what we've been asking all along. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=182.94s)]
*  The attempt or what you showed on the map, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=185.26s)]
*  and I can agree that it's not perfect, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=187.48s)]
*  but by the way, I contest the fact [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=189.33999999999997s)]
*  that there's a blackout, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=191.38s)]
*  because I saw lots of cameras out [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=192.33999999999997s)]
*  when our hostages were being returned [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=195.1s)]
*  and I saw lots of live footage [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=196.78s)]
*  from those occasions as well. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=198.7s)]
*  Well, tonight though, there is. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=200.26s)]
*  I was actually gonna interview the spokesperson [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=202.1s)]
*  for the Red Cross. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=203.98s)]
*  We were unable to get communications, Colonel, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=204.82s)]
*  for 45 minutes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=207.14s)]
*  I mean, there is a widespread blackout tonight. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=207.98s)]
*  I've seen the spokesperson of UNICEF on CNN [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  and every other living network, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=214.33999999999997s)]
*  and I think that there isn't really such a blackout, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  because evidently he has service, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=218.66s)]
*  and many others have, and there's video coming out. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=220.76s)]
*  Listen, I understand that it's not perfect, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=223.33999999999997s)]
*  but this is what we are trying to do. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=225.82s)]
*  We're trying to reach out to Palestinians. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=228.06s)]
*  We're trying to inform them ahead of time [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=230.62s)]
*  where fighting is going to be [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=233.72s)]
*  in order for them to be able to take precautions [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=235.34s)]
*  and move from where there's going to be fighting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=237.82s)]
*  I don't know how else we can square that circle [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=240.56s)]
*  of defeating Hamas where Hamas is [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=244.82s)]
*  and minimizing civilian casualties. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=247.62s)]
*  If anybody with military experience has an idea, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=249.62s)]
*  we're open for suggestions, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=252.74s)]
*  but it has to square in defeating Hamas, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=254.04s)]
*  not seizing operations and letting Hamas win, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=257.3s)]
*  but defeating Hamas and minimizing collateral [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=260.3s)]
*  or damage to civilians. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  Colonel, one final point on the blackout [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=265.58s)]
*  that has been going on the past few hours, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=267.78000000000003s)]
*  and the Red Cross was there earlier. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=269.88s)]
*  There was video earlier, and that's actually why [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=271.22s)]
*  we had the interview scheduled with the Red Cross. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=273.94s)]
*  Then the blackout affecting most of Gaza has been in effect. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=275.82s)]
*  Do you know if it's been resolved? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=279.02s)]
*  Do you know why it's in place? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=280.76s)]
*  I am not aware of a blackout. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=285.22s)]
*  I am aware of problems with coverage in local areas. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  There have been reports of it, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  but I see live streaming by Palestinian propagandists [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=292.5s)]
*  from various areas, including from 20 minutes ago, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  I watched it live of a very known, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=299.74s)]
*  notorious Palestinian propagandist. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=302.54s)]
*  He was live on TikTok. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  So there is Wi-Fi, maybe not specifically [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=305.82000000000005s)]
*  with the Red Cross that you were speaking with, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=309.3s)]
*  but I am factually aware that there is live [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=311.78000000000003s)]
*  internet services in Gaza. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=314.66s)]
*  Not perfect and not 5G Manhattan speed, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=316.36s)]
*  but there definitely is international internet service. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=319.0s)]
*  All right, well, Colonel Konrykos, I appreciate your time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=322.38s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=324.56s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFrJSRbQM8s&t=326.78000000000003s)]
