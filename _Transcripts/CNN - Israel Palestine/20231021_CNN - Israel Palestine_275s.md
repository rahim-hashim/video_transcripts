# Ret. US general predicts Israel’s strategy for a ground battle in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI)
*  with me now, CNN military analyst, retired Major General James Spider Mark Spider. Great to see [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=0.0s)]
*  you here. This is the restricted area right now where the Israeli military is massing. We have seen [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=4.88s)]
*  satellite images of tanks lining up, literally lining up here, preparing to go. I can show you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=11.76s)]
*  where that is. This is not privileged top-seeking information. The Israelis have made very clear [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=18.72s)]
*  where this is happening. Those pictures were taken from up here. We can also assume there might be [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=22.8s)]
*  tanks preparing elsewhere in this restricted zone. So, Spider, what are they doing now and what are [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=28.32s)]
*  they getting ready to do? Yeah, at this particular point, John, what they're doing is what we call [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  pre-combat checks. Individuals and teams are getting ready to go. There's a lot of silence. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=39.52s)]
*  There's a lot of focus. This is business. Nobody's messing around. They're also doing rehearsals. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=44.24s)]
*  What's going to take place on the ground? They've got a scheme of maneuver. They have a plan. They're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=49.6s)]
*  using what we call sand tables and they're trying to figure out what they're going to do. They're [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=54.4s)]
*  going to refine that, but simultaneously they're doing intelligence collection. Well, talk to me [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=59.12s)]
*  about the intelligence collection right now. What different types of intelligence they're using? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=63.6s)]
*  What they're probably using, I would imagine, is they're probably using drones. They want to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=66.96s)]
*  get the drones up in the air. They want to get the very latest because those plans will be altered [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=71.2s)]
*  based on the intelligence. Imit means drones? Yeah, imagery, imagery, intelligence, and the thing that they can do at their level. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=76.0s)]
*  The individual operators can fly drones. They can get intelligence that's going to affect them in a [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=82.72s)]
*  very tactical way. They're also probably putting special ops teams, very small teams, across into [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=87.44s)]
*  Gaza. There's lots of chaos. There's a lot of smoke. There's a lot of haze. There's a lot of stuff going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=94.0s)]
*  on so they can infiltrate folks to put eyes on targets as best they can. I would imagine that's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=99.12s)]
*  taking place as well. They're also tracking the cell phones of all the Hamas leaders. Signals [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=105.28s)]
*  intelligence. Signals intelligence, exactly correct. And that's why there's targeting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=111.12s)]
*  taking place right now in southern Gaza because that's where a lot of the Hamas leadership phones [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  are located. Yeah, we were talking about that right here. This is the imagery from Rafa. You can see [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=121.2s)]
*  where some of those things were taking place. We have some video here also of the trucks coming over [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  right there. But as you were looking at that, you think that they made those strikes because they were [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=130.32s)]
*  following signals intelligence. Absolutely. And you look at where Hamas is located. Look, they're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=135.36s)]
*  not completely and exclusively focused in the north. They're throughout Gaza. Let's go back. I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=140.0s)]
*  want to talk about these tanks that we see preparing to go in. When they do make that decision to go [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=144.88s)]
*  in, whether it's this weekend or a few days from now, what paths do you think they'll take? Yeah, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=150.72s)]
*  I think what's going to happen, and it's more than just tanks, these are combat arms teams. So you've [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=156.4s)]
*  got infantry that's mounted. You've got armor forces. You've got artillery, etc. And it's going [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=160.16s)]
*  to be preceded by good intelligence. I think what they would probably do, look, the Wadi Gaza [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=165.92s)]
*  comes through here. That's a river, a marshland. That's the wetlands. I think what they would do [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  is they would enter in from here. They'd come in on multiple axes of advance. They'd come in from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=176.32s)]
*  the north, of course. They'd come in here. And also Israel has a navy. They've got what's called [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  corvettes, which are small, smaller attack ships. They've got 45 patrol boats. They've got 10,000 [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=186.0s)]
*  sailors on active duty. I would also anticipate activity that would look like this because what [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=191.6s)]
*  Israel wants to do, you want to secure this combat zone. You want to secure the perimeter. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=196.72s)]
*  And then you go, all these units will link up, go to the same place, link up. Then you begin the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=203.68s)]
*  operation to go after very specific targets. And those targets, John, are really the political and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=209.2s)]
*  military leaders of Hamas. People. The people. They want to go after them. And I think they [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  would probably have either a kill or capture mission. In this particular case, I would imagine [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=221.44s)]
*  it's a kill mission. Second thing they want to go after is the tunnel complex, which is extensive. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=225.52s)]
*  As you realize, I can show you that we're going to lose this, but this is a map of what the tunnels [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  looked like in 2021. That is some time ago. They probably expanded and redone it, but you can see [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=236.32s)]
*  some of the tunnel imagery that was there then. That is the most difficult task that they have [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=242.56s)]
*  to take on. This is urban terrain with a subterranean piece. And Israel has got to [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=246.96s)]
*  identify. They have to deny and they have to destroy those tunnels. That is a man [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=253.84s)]
*  combat suck. That's going to draw people into it. This is going to be a difficult, difficult fight. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  All right, Spider, thank you so much for explaining all this. Don't go far because obviously, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=266.08s)]
*  you know, more things could be happening very, very soon. Thank you very much. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3bTGgCfNyI&t=271.36s)]
