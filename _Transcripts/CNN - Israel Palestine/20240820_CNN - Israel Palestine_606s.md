# She says Israeli military killed her husband and daughter. Then soldiers took her to Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I)
*  Five-year-old Shams eyes are a portal to the past she cannot forget. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=0.0s)]
*  There are the streets and homes scarred by war. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=8.0s)]
*  This building where she recited her final prayers. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=11.6s)]
*  And then there is the indelible sight of her father and sister shot dead before her eyes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=15.52s)]
*  Shams mother Sanaa, who suffered burns as a child, will never forget that day. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=25.6s)]
*  But there's more to their story than tragedy and loss in war-torn Gaza. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=39.04s)]
*  Shams and Sanaa's story is unlike any other we have come across in ten months of war. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=44.08s)]
*  It's because Sanaa doesn't just accuse Israeli troops of killing her husband Akram and daughter [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=50.24s)]
*  Yasmine. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=55.92s)]
*  An Israeli soldier may also have saved her life. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=56.92s)]
*  On November 24th, the week-long truce between Israel and Hamas begins. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=63.0s)]
*  Thousands of people begin heading back to their homes in northern Gaza. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=68.08s)]
*  Sanaa and her family are among them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=72.16s)]
*  But as they approach the Salatine neighborhood where they lived, they find themselves walking [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=75.62s)]
*  and then shots ring out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=80.96s)]
*  Her husband soon decides to crawl away to try to find help. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=104.76s)]
*  But moments later, he is shot again, fatally. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=108.92s)]
*  Sanaa lies on the ground, bleeding, cradling her eldest daughter Yasmine. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=113.16000000000001s)]
*  As a mother, you must have felt absolutely helpless in that moment. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=118.2s)]
*  Yasmine soon died in her mother's arms. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=148.2s)]
*  For hours, Sanaa lies here with Shams, unable to move, until she finally finds the strength [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  to crawl down the street and into this nearby home. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  We obtained footage from that house after our first interview with Sanaa. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=173.0s)]
*  This is the first time she and Shams are seeing it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=177.32s)]
*  And Shams begins to tell my colleague, Abir Salman, what happened to her. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=184.28s)]
*  An explosion then rocks the bathroom. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=188.6s)]
*  Israeli soldiers enter the house and call out in Arabic. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=208.44s)]
*  What happens next is captured on muted body camera footage provided by the Israeli military. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=212.2s)]
*  Two soldiers treating Sanaa's gunshot wound. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=217.8s)]
*  The medic soon realizes her condition is serious. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=243.96s)]
*  She needs to get to a hospital. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=247.56s)]
*  Israeli soldiers carry Sanaa out of the building on a stretcher, her hands clutching Shams. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=261.24s)]
*  Nothing about this footage should be extraordinary. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=267.8s)]
*  Militaries must protect and care for wounded civilians when possible under international law. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  But in this war, this sight is exceedingly rare. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=277.16s)]
*  For eight months, Sanaa and Shams have lived in this Jerusalem hospital. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  Their journey here was no less traumatic. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=287.88000000000005s)]
*  Interrogation and strip searches came before treatment at an Israeli hospital. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=290.44000000000005s)]
*  Israeli authorities are now planning to send them back to Gaza next month, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=295.72s)]
*  unless another country takes them in. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=300.20000000000005s)]
*  The Israeli military for its part told CNN in a statement that Sanaa and her family were caught [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=302.35999999999996s)]
*  in the crossfire. The IDF says its soldiers issued verbal warnings after the family stumbled upon a [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  concealed military position, drawing a militant attack. The four people who entered in the area [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=315.55999999999995s)]
*  were caught in the intense exchange of fire between the terrorists and our troops. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  The troops did not open fire at the four people, nor did they aim at them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=326.91999999999996s)]
*  I wonder what would you say to that one soldier if you could see him again? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=332.28s)]
*  Sanaa's pain is as raw as ever, and seeing her home again in footage filmed this spring [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=343.72s)]
*  brings a flood of emotion. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  Mundane objects are transformed into relics. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=374.68s)]
*  And Sanaa is taken back in time to the life she will never get back. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  And Jeremy is joining us now from Tel Aviv. Jeremy, very, very powerful story. I want to know [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=397.88s)]
*  whether there is any update to the fact that you report the IDF says they're going to send her back [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=401.24s)]
*  with her daughter. Is that really possible? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=406.12s)]
*  As of now, Israeli authorities are planning to send Sanaa and Shom back to Gaza at some point [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=411.72s)]
*  early next month. But as I understand it, if a third country comes in and says that they will [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  take them in, then there is an option here for them to not go back to Gaza. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  And I do want to stress what that could mean if they were sent back to Gaza. I spoke with Shom [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=432.12s)]
*  actually just in the last, sorry, I spoke with Sanaa in just the last hour, and she told me that [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=436.84s)]
*  she is terrified of going back to Gaza, terrified of what life would be like if she were living with [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=441.8s)]
*  her family who are currently living in makeshift shelters. They've been displaced four times in [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=447.8s)]
*  Gaza already so far during this war. But most of all, she is terrified about what going back to [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=452.6s)]
*  Gaza could mean for her daughter, Shom. I first met Shom five months ago, and the girl that she [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  is now is very different from the girl she was five months ago. She has opened up so much more, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=464.68s)]
*  and her mother is terrified that should they go back to Gaza, all of the progress that she has [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  made since then could effectively be erased in an instant. It is incredible how resilient children [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=475.0s)]
*  can be given half the chance. But I want to know what about the bigger picture in terms of a ceasefire [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=481.56s)]
*  for everybody's sake, transfer of hostages and prisoners. There's all sorts of leaking, as you [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=487.0s)]
*  know, and reporting of blaming and finger pointing at the Netanyahu government for [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=493.72s)]
*  not pushing these ahead. Even within this Israeli establishment, there are criticisms for the way [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=499.96s)]
*  this is going. And even Egypt has been leaking that they don't think the Israelis want a ceasefire. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=505.72s)]
*  What do you think is going on? How much do you, how much store do you set by what the Americans [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=512.76s)]
*  are saying that it's so close? It is so hard to know who or what information to believe at this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=519.72s)]
*  stage, and so I think we have to just kind of keep an open mind about various different [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  possibilities. There's no question, though, that it very much seems like the Americans are the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=531.48s)]
*  most kind of optimistic, the most gung-ho about this current negotiating process. And at times, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=535.56s)]
*  it really does feel like they are almost trying to will this ceasefire agreement into existence. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=540.5999999999999s)]
*  Yesterday, we heard the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, saying that Israel has accepted this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=547.56s)]
*  bridging proposal, which is intended to bridge the gaps between the Israeli position and the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=552.3599999999999s)]
*  Hamas position. But at the same time, we are still hearing doubts in the Israeli government [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=556.8399999999999s)]
*  about Israel's full commitment to the current version of the ceasefire proposal. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=561.56s)]
*  And in addition to that, Hamas is saying that they believe this bridging proposal is effectively [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=566.52s)]
*  caving to a series of Israeli demands, which they view as total non-starters. So right now, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=571.4799999999999s)]
*  it seems difficult to imagine how a deal could come together this week, which is what the United [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=578.5999999999999s)]
*  States has said their goal is. But it is clear that at least negotiations are continuing, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  and we expect the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, as he arrives in Doha, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=589.64s)]
*  Qatar, to get a better sense from the Qataris, who are the key interlocutors with Hamas, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=594.28s)]
*  about exactly where their head is at behind the scenes. So these negotiations are certainly [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=598.76s)]
*  continuing. Very hard to see where they go from here. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX2ECFueF-I&t=603.0s)]
