# Qatar announces when Israel-Hamas truce will begin
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0)
*  The beginning of the pause will be 7 a.m. Friday, the 24th of November, and it will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=0.0s)]
*  last, of course, as agreed, for four days. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  And the first patch of civilians to be released from Gaza will be around 4 p.m. of the same [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=11.16s)]
*  day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=18.64s)]
*  There will be 13 in number, all women and children, and those hostages who are from [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=19.64s)]
*  the same families will be put together within the same patch. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  CNN's Becky Anderson, who was in that press conference, asked multiple great questions. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  Becky, I think one of the key ones that you asked was what happens if one side breaches [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=33.64s)]
*  this agreement? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  What is the result of that? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  What stood out to you about the answer from the Qatari official? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=41.04s)]
*  It was an interesting answer, wasn't it? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=46.8s)]
*  He said this has to be a secession of hostilities completely on both sides, on the ground, and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=48.68s)]
*  for periods of time in the air. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=57.6s)]
*  And he made it very clear when asked about drones in the air, surveillance drones in [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=60.6s)]
*  the air, he said specifically during the period of the hostages being released, there would [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  be no surveillance drones flown. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=70.68s)]
*  And we know because we've had two what we might call proof of concept episodes where [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=75.16s)]
*  we've seen two sets of hostages released, of course, the American mother and her 17-year-old [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=82.2s)]
*  daughter some weeks ago and then two elderly Israeli citizens. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=88.28s)]
*  We know that there were drones in the air at the time. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=91.92s)]
*  And what he suggested is that can be very confusing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=94.76s)]
*  It can make people feel that there may be some hostile activity in the air. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  So certainly during the periods of time when the hostages are being released, the air, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=104.88000000000001s)]
*  the skies will be clear, the airspace over those hostages will be clear. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=110.88s)]
*  Let's just be very specific, I think, about what we learned today, Kaylin. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=115.92s)]
*  This truce starts at 7 a.m. local Gaza time, that is 12 a.m. or midnight Eastern time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=121.56s)]
*  And at some point after, 4 o'clock in the afternoon, so 9 a.m. Eastern time, we will [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=130.48s)]
*  see the first 13 hostages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=139.44s)]
*  The names of those 13 hostages have now been shared with both the Mossad on the Israeli [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=142.88s)]
*  side and the reciprocal arrangement, as it were, the release of Palestinian prisoners [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  into the Palestinians' hands will happen around the same time, although Mershid Al-Ansar, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here, couldn't say exactly how many [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=166.0s)]
*  hostages would be exchanged. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=170.48s)]
*  And then after that, every day, there will be a list shared with both sides on those [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=173.2s)]
*  who will be released every day at around the same time. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=181.28s)]
*  So let's assume for it to be around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, Gaza time, for four days. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=186.0s)]
*  That would take us up to effectively 50 hostages, women and children. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=193.68s)]
*  After that, Mershid Al-Ansar reminded us that the proposal, the deal includes an opportunity [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=199.84s)]
*  for Hamas to come good on its agreement. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=208.88s)]
*  And for every 10 extra hostages released, and the understanding is that they are holding [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=213.36s)]
*  as many as 70 to 80, there will be an extra day of this pause, this secession of hostilities [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  for this brief period of time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=228.08s)]
*  So lots of good detail from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here today, an important detail, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  because although we knew that this deal had been agreed to, there were lots and lots of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=236.96s)]
*  things that were still unclear until we heard from Mershid Al-Ansar at this press conference [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=243.36s)]
*  today, Caitlin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  CLAIRE SILVERMAN Yeah, that was key there, Becky, a sense of optimism that, from the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  Qataris at least, that this could potentially go on for longer than the planned four days. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=258.24s)]
*  We'll see, of course, there is a good reason to be skeptical here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=262.4s)]
*  We'll see what this looks like once it's actually put into effect. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=264.96s)]
*  Thank you, Becky Anderson and Kate. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, this is the news that so many of these families have been waiting for, that at [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=269.84s)]
*  midnight Eastern tonight, this temporary truce is going to go into place, and that based on what [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  we just heard, if everything goes according to plan, 24 hours from now, we will see 13 women [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=278.88s)]
*  and civilian hostages released by Hamas and Gaza Kite. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=284.32s)]
*  KATE LEONARD CAYLIN Thank you so much. To remind everyone of the breaking news, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=289.2s)]
*  which is this is a big moment that we're looking at right now. As of the news is, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=293.12s)]
*  midnight tonight Eastern time, 7 a.m. local, the truce sets in. 4 p.m. local, 9 a.m. Eastern [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=298.32s)]
*  around, the hostages will begin to be released. And Israel has confirmed that they have a list [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=306.56s)]
*  in hand of the 13 hostages to be first released. 13 women and children are now just hours away, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=314.24s)]
*  hopefully from ending a week's long nightmare. Joining us now on this news, finally, some more [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=322.0s)]
*  detail that we have gotten about what this exchange will look like is former Deputy Director of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=329.12s)]
*  National Intelligence, Beth Sanner, CNN Global Affairs Analyst, Kim Dozier, and retired Army [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=334.24s)]
*  Brigadier General Mark Kement. Thank you guys for being here. Beth, what's your reaction to all of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=339.12s)]
*  what we just heard laid out by Qatari officials of what this process is going to look like now? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=344.56s)]
*  BETH SANNER Well, I guess I'll skip ahead a little bit because I think that, you know, tomorrow looks [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=351.68s)]
*  very good. But as each day progresses, it gets harder and more challenging. And it's clear from [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=357.12s)]
*  the way the Qatari's laid out this plan that their goal is very, very divergent from where the Israeli [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=364.08s)]
*  goal is in the end. The Qatari's want to extend this indefinitely and lead this lead to a peace [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=371.84s)]
*  agreement or full ceasefire. And Israel is absolutely in a different place. And so I think that, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=379.2s)]
*  you know, this does become much more complicated as each day goes by. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  It's an excellent point because we just heard from the Prime Minister himself definitively saying [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  the war continues last night, that the mission remains to demolish Hamas. In general, in terms of [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  what this truce means and how it holds. So midnight tonight Eastern is when the truce is set in. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=402.4s)]
*  And our Becky Anderson, our colleague over there, she asked Qatari officials, what would constitute [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=408.64s)]
*  a breach of this agreement, a break in that truce by either side? And the Qatari visual [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=413.52s)]
*  definitely did not answer the question. What do you think would, is it clear what would constitute [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=419.28s)]
*  a breach and what happens if they do? Well, I think what would happen is there would be [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=424.64s)]
*  some undisciplined fire from perhaps a individual Hamas soldier that may or may not agree with what [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=431.76s)]
*  is going on. He may be trying to lure the IDF into firing back. That happens so often in these [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=440.0s)]
*  tentative ceasefires around the world. I think that that would not return the situation to a full [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=446.72s)]
*  combat operation. But as they said in the press conference, they would do everything they could [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  to contain that type of violation. I think at this point, both sides want this pause to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  stay in place during the duration of the hostage exchange. And what the pause does a pause beget [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  a pause is kind of a question, Kim, because a former head of Mossad told me last night [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=477.59999999999997s)]
*  that it will be for the IDF much harder to start the fighting in the military operation back up [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=483.76s)]
*  once this truce sets in. For one, because he believed the mounting international pressure [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=491.12s)]
*  that would start building to at least bring about a slowdown. The IDF and the prime minister [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=497.44s)]
*  have assured, though, that they are going to return to operations. The mission continues. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=502.64s)]
*  What do you think of this? Well, Israel has said that this agreement expires after 10 days, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=508.64s)]
*  and the White House is hoping that if the first four days go well, each of those additional days [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=516.16s)]
*  could lead to more hostage exchanges, possibly up to 10 days. But turning the war back on is [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=523.36s)]
*  going to be really hard for the Israeli government because there will be pressure from the hostage [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  families to keep this going, to keep the exchanges going, because Hamas militants, they're not going [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=538.24s)]
*  anywhere. They're stuck inside Gaza. So what's the difference between waiting another 10 or 20 days [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=545.44s)]
*  to prosecute the war versus starting it earlier? Beth Netanyahu, the role of the Red Cross was [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=551.12s)]
*  brought up in this press conference with Qatari officials, and he essentially said that the Red [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=563.36s)]
*  Cross has a role in accepting the hostages and facilitating that. But there is also then Netanyahu [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=569.2s)]
*  saying yesterday that the Red Cross, he said, the expectation is, will be allowed to visit the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=578.08s)]
*  hostages who remain behind, remain in Gaza, and even offer medical support to those hostages. But [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  the Red Cross, you know, the confusion sets in because the Red Cross says this morning they aren't [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=591.84s)]
*  aware of that agreement at all, though ready to help in any way. Do you see Hamas letting the Red [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=596.32s)]
*  Cross in? What do you see as the role here? Well, Hamas will do what it sees in its interests [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=602.48s)]
*  and how it views that in terms of its broader interests of extending the ceasefire indefinitely, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=612.48s)]
*  giving itself time to regroup, trying to present itself as the good guys here, you know, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=620.64s)]
*  which is very hard for us to see, right? But I think when you are looking at it from the Arab [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=630.4s)]
*  world, it looks different. So, yeah, I can see it actually happening in a way that Hamas tries to [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=636.48s)]
*  twist it into something positive for them. In the end, you know, getting IRC in there is absolutely [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=643.04s)]
*  the right thing and the good thing to do. So we'll have to see how this goes. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnzeS6Nb8z0&t=650.48s)]
