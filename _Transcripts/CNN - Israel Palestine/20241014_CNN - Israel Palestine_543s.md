# 'Tacit approval': CNN analyst on what US sending defense system to Israel signals
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI)
*  The United States sending U.S. troops to Israel. A U.S. defense official tells CNN that about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=0.0s)]
*  100 troops are deploying there to operate one of the United States' most advanced [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  missile defense systems. The Pentagon's announcement comes as Israel faces unprecedented attacks from Iran. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=10.08s)]
*  What we're seeing is a massive increase in the number of missiles and drones that Hezbollah is [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=18.8s)]
*  firing into Israel. The first 10 months of this war they were firing anywhere from 30 to 50 per day. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=24.72s)]
*  Over the last three days they fired somewhere around 300 per day. This is the best system in [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=31.28s)]
*  the world and there's only six of them, six batteries of these in the United States inventory. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=37.2s)]
*  So loaning one and deploying a group of soldiers to Israel is a pretty big deal. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=42.64s)]
*  Just yesterday a Hezbollah drone entering into Israel's airspace without triggering an alert [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=49.04s)]
*  killed four soldiers, injured more than 60 people. The attack was one of the bloodiest [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=53.92s)]
*  against Israel since the war began over a year ago. Joining us now with more CNN global affairs [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=58.64s)]
*  analyst Kim Dozier. Kim, good morning. Always grateful to have you. So help us understand what [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=64.0s)]
*  this system adds to the defenses that the Israelis already have and how concerned [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=69.2s)]
*  potentially Americans should be about U.S. troops deploying there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=79.2s)]
*  It adds another layer of air defense in that what it does is it knocks ballistic missiles, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=82.96s)]
*  mid-range and long-range, out of the sky. With Iran in its last volley of missiles it fired at Israel, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=89.84s)]
*  it switched up to mostly ballistic missiles. This will counteract that or help counteract that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=98.56s)]
*  So it's a look ahead to what might happen after Israel does some sort of retaliation against Iran's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=104.72s)]
*  last volley of ballistic missiles. But it does put roughly 95 to 100 troops on the ground in Israel, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=111.92s)]
*  which the U.S. hasn't done before. And it's also a signal to people in the Middle East and really [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=120.4s)]
*  throughout the world that while Israel is stepping up its attacks in Lebanon, in Gaza, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=128.16s)]
*  that the U.S. is making statements about that but then acting by sending this missile defense [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=135.84s)]
*  system. It's tacit approval of everything Israel is doing. At least that's how it will be seen [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  by many in the Arab world. So you see this as, I mean, there is, it does seem to be a distinction [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=148.16s)]
*  between this is something that is designed to defend Israel from attacks, right? As opposed to, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=155.2s)]
*  I mean, one of the major criticisms certainly the left has for politicians here is providing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=159.84s)]
*  the bombs that are falling on Gaza. How does the Biden administration separate these two things, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=164.32s)]
*  if at all? Well, the important thing is that what it does is by protecting Israel, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=170.48s)]
*  the U.S. is hoping to keep Israel from stepping up to the next kind of response. By sending this now [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=177.68s)]
*  before Israel has responded to Iran's last volley of ballistic missiles, it's saying, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=185.35999999999999s)]
*  we will be here to protect you. You don't have to do as big a strike as you may be planning on Iran, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=192.4s)]
*  on all of their ballistic missile sites because we're going to provide another way to protect [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=199.68s)]
*  your population from this. Really interesting. All right, Kim Dozier for us this morning. Kim, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  thank you very much for being here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=208.56s)]
*  The U.S. announced Sunday will send an advanced anti-missile system to Israel to help bolster the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=213.12s)]
*  country's air defenses, along with about 100 U.S. troops to operate it. It comes as the aerospace [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=219.04s)]
*  commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps says his country is ready to respond to any action or [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=225.04s)]
*  quote misstep by Israel. CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger explains [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=230.88s)]
*  the significance of the Pentagon's announcement. I think what what else we're learning here is that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  the president's tolerance for having American troops in the way here, in even in defensive [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=242.56s)]
*  positions in Israel, is increasing a little bit. That he is thinks it's a relatively small risk [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=251.44s)]
*  to have 100 Americans there. Obviously, there are thousands of Americans on board [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=259.6s)]
*  the ships and in nearby bases to try to help defend Israel as well. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  Israeli officials say Hezbollah launched a drone attack on Sunday, killing at least four soldiers [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  and wounding more than 60 people. It's one of the bloodiest attacks on Israeli soil since the war [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=280.56s)]
*  broke out last year. The drones targeted an army base about 40 miles from the Lebanese border. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=285.44s)]
*  The IDF says it will investigate why the attack didn't trigger an alarm. Hezbollah called the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=291.12s)]
*  retaliation for Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Thursday, which continued into the weekend. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=295.68s)]
*  Lebanese health officials say Israeli strikes on Saturday killed 51 people and wounded more than [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=301.2s)]
*  170 others. And while concerns continue over a wider conflict, Israeli strikes on targets in Gaza [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=305.52s)]
*  go on. This was the scene inside the Al Aqsa hospital courtyard early Monday, where four people [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=313.76s)]
*  were killed and dozens wounded. Tents were in flames with people trying unsuccessfully to put [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=319.44s)]
*  out the fires. The Israeli military says it conducted a precise strike on a Hamas command [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=325.36s)]
*  center inside the compound. And we have to warn you that the video we're about to show you is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  disturbing. On Sunday, more than 40 people, at least 13 children, were killed in another Gaza [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=335.44s)]
*  strike, according to hospital officials. At least 22 were killed when the al-Mufti school in the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=341.6s)]
*  Nisirat refugee camp was hit. But remarkably, today, in the middle of all this destruction, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=348.0s)]
*  the UN is set to begin the second phase of its emergency polio vaccination campaign. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=354.4s)]
*  The World Health Organization hopes to provide more than half a million doses of the vaccine [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=359.76s)]
*  after a successful first round in September, when 95 percent of eligible children were [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=364.64s)]
*  inoculated. Joining me now to discuss all of this is CNN's Nada Bashir. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=371.76s)]
*  Nada, a lot of important points to get through here. But I just want to start first with the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=375.84s)]
*  increased military presence that the U.S. announced they were sending on Sunday. Troops on the ground, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=380.8s)]
*  also a deployment of this advanced anti-missile system to Israel. Talk to us a bit more about [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=386.08s)]
*  the significance of this decision at this time when Israel is weighing and preparing for a response [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=392.0s)]
*  militarily to Iran. Well, Christina, we know that the Biden administration has been in close [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=398.08000000000004s)]
*  contact and coordination with counterparts in Israel. The tone from the White House is one of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=403.68s)]
*  de-escalation. They want the response by Israel to be proportional in order to prevent this from [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=408.88s)]
*  spiraling out of control into an even more broader regional war than what we have already seen [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=415.2s)]
*  escalating in parts of Lebanon and Syria, of course. But clearly, what we've been also hearing [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=421.12s)]
*  from the Biden administration is that continued steadfast support for the state of Israel. And [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=426.64s)]
*  this support in the form of air defense system support and, of course, U.S. troops as well to [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=431.92s)]
*  operate them comes amid those mountain tensions, amid concern that there could be yet a further [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=436.72s)]
*  response from the Iranian regime targeting Israeli territory, if indeed we do see an attack by Israel [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=442.24s)]
*  targeting Iranian territory. Now, this specific defense system is focused on defending against [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=448.48s)]
*  ballistic missiles. The hope would be that this would support Israel in its defense against any [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=455.68s)]
*  future attacks from the Iranian regime. And, of course, we have been hearing from Iranian officials [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=460.4s)]
*  suggesting that that attack, that that response could well be likely if indeed we do see Israel [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=466.96s)]
*  taking action. Take a listen to this statement from the Iranian foreign minister. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=472.88s)]
*  We are prepared for any kind of circumstances. We are ready for war, but we are also ready for [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=481.52s)]
*  peace. This is the definitive stance of the Islamic Republic. We are entirely ready for [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=486.64s)]
*  a military conflict. We are not afraid of war, but we do not wish for war. We want peace, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=492.24s)]
*  and we will seek a just peace in Lebanon and Gaza. Now, of course, the Israeli government and cabinet [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  has not yet come to a conclusive decision as to what that response by Israel will look like with [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=505.28s)]
*  regards to retaliation for Iran's attack on Israeli territory on October 1st. Again, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=510.0s)]
*  the Biden administration has been calling for the response to be proportional. They do not want to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=516.88s)]
*  see Israel targeting Iran's nuclear facilities or oil fields. That is certainly a huge concern with [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=521.36s)]
*  the potential for that to trigger an even broader war in the region, particularly with regards to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=528.16s)]
*  Iran's regional proxies. And we've already seen the effects of the broadening of the conflict in [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=532.88s)]
*  Gaza, in Lebanon, in Syria, with disastrous impact for civilians there as well. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIrwGowgzI&t=537.6s)]
