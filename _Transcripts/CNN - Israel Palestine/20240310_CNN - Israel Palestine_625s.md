# Retired colonel says this move could be a sign of a rift between US-Israel relations
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [March 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4)
*  President Biden had said in an interview on MSNBC on Saturday that, look, his red line [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=0.0s)]
*  would be Israel going into Ra'a, which even Israel's closest allies and many other countries [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=4.44s)]
*  in the international community would be a catastrophe because you have well over a million [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=9.78s)]
*  people there who are sheltering and frankly there is nowhere for them to go. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=14.36s)]
*  Israel has said that they would evacuate them elsewhere, but there is fighting and bombing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  taking place in virtually every other part of the country. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=23.1s)]
*  And yet despite that warning from President Biden of not crossing that red line, we have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=26.1s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that that offensive in Ra'a will in fact go ahead, saying [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=31.040000000000003s)]
*  that his red line is October 7th and making sure that that doesn't happen again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=36.92s)]
*  And he said that an IDF incursion into Ra'a to root out Hamas there could take two months, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=42.46s)]
*  perhaps even less than two months, and that there would be no pause in the fighting until [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=48.58s)]
*  there is some kind of a deal made to bring the hostages home. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  He also left open the possibility of expanding military operations into southern Lebanon, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=57.92s)]
*  where of course there have been many back and forth fires, firing between Hezbollah [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=64.66s)]
*  and the Israelis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=70.14s)]
*  In fact, you have hundreds or you have tens of thousands of Israelis who've been forced [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=71.14s)]
*  to leave their home in northern Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=75.0s)]
*  And this is what Netanyahu said about ensuring those people can go back home. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=78.10000000000001s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=82.54s)]
*  So we will do whatever we can to restore security for them and bring them home. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=85.18s)]
*  And I hope we can do that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=90.18s)]
*  If we have to do it with military means, we'll do so. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  If there's a diplomatic way to achieve it, fine. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=95.56s)]
*  But ultimately we'll do it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=99.22s)]
*  It is worth pointing out, Erika, that Hezbollah is a much more formidable fighting force that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=103.66s)]
*  really dwarfs the capabilities of Hamas. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=110.08s)]
*  The Israelis themselves estimate, at least before the war, estimated that there were [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=114.28s)]
*  hundreds, maybe thousands of rockets stored in people's private homes near the border [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=118.32s)]
*  within firing range of Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=123.36s)]
*  When it comes to the negotiations to get those hostages back in any kind of a potential ceasefire, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=127.02s)]
*  the hopes of that happening anytime soon are pretty dim at this stage of the game. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=133.26s)]
*  You had President Biden pointing out that the CIA director was in Israel to meet with [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=137.64s)]
*  his Mossad counterpart. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=142.92s)]
*  But the problem is that the Israelis and Hamas are not actually talking to each other, at [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=144.6s)]
*  least not publicly. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=149.2s)]
*  You had Hamas leaving the last round of talks in Cairo on Thursday, and the Israelis were [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  never there in the first place because they say that Hamas has failed to address its latest [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  demands, which include providing a list of hostages which are alive and which hostages [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=159.64s)]
*  are dead. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  Hamas says that it cannot provide. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=166.4s)]
*  Hamas is also digging in on its key demands of a permanent ceasefire and a full withdrawal [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=168.68s)]
*  of the IDF from Gaza, both things that are going to be very difficult for the Israelis [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  to agree to because they continue to insist that the war will only end, as you heard the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=178.84s)]
*  prime minister saying there, until Hamas is completely destroyed. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  And that means going into Ra'afe, whether that's before or after any kind of a ceasefire [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=186.96s)]
*  deal is made. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  They also say that the day after the war, the IDF will have full control, free reign [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=193.56s)]
*  to go wherever they want inside of Gaza, and the IDF will also continue to control the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=198.32s)]
*  borders of everything going in and out of the territory. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=203.92s)]
*  We also heard from the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, who gave a televised address saying [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=207.32s)]
*  that Hamas is still open to talks, but he says that it is Israel who is to blame for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=211.48s)]
*  the lack of progress. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  And he also insisted that there would be no hostages released until there's a deal. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=218.98s)]
*  Erica? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=223.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=224.98s)]
*  And as we watch all of that, a lot of really important developments tonight, Scott. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=225.98s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=228.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=229.38s)]
*  I also want to bring in now CNN military analyst, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Layton. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=230.38s)]
*  Colonel, always good to see you. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  First, I'd just love to get your reaction as we start to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  comments about invading Ra'afe, which of course come on the heels of what we heard [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=240.98s)]
*  from President Biden in that interview yesterday. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=245.62s)]
*  Yeah, Erica, I think this is really setting things up for a showdown between President [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=248.82s)]
*  Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=254.45999999999998s)]
*  It looks as if both sides, both U.S. side and the Israeli side, are basically digging [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=256.38s)]
*  in in their respective positions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=262.62s)]
*  The Israelis have that military imperative of basically destroying Hamas and doing it [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=264.82s)]
*  at Ra'afe because everybody seems to be concentrated in that area there in the southern part of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=275.41999999999996s)]
*  The problem with that, as Scott pointed out in his reporting, one million plus people [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=276.66s)]
*  are right there because they have to flee to that location. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=282.42s)]
*  And to get them out of there, to get them out of harm's way is going to be really difficult [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  to do under the best of circumstances. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=289.9s)]
*  And in these conditions, those circumstances are certainly quite difficult. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=292.38s)]
*  So it's one of those areas where we're going to see a lot of difficulty, a lot of problems. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=297.7s)]
*  This could portend a rift in the U.S.-Israeli relations, at least to some extent. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=304.14s)]
*  And that could be really dangerous for any peace prospects for this area. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=310.14s)]
*  Were you surprised at all at how far we saw the president go in those comments yesterday? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=315.38s)]
*  So saying that Ra'afe would be a red line. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  When asked about other specific red lines, he was a little less committal, if you will, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=322.14s)]
*  but said there can be another 30,000, another 30,000 Palestinian civilian deaths, for [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=328.41999999999996s)]
*  example, the fact that the rhetoric is now ramping up. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=333.18s)]
*  And to your point, the impact that this could have moving forward, especially given the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  U.S.'s role in these talks, in these efforts to try to get to a ceasefire, to try to get [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  some of the hostages home, how damaging could this be at this point? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=348.94s)]
*  This could be very damaging. It could be damaging for the Israeli hostages that are still being [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=354.5s)]
*  held by Hamas. It could be damaging for all the Palestinian civilians that are caught [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=358.78s)]
*  in this, in Gaza, especially in Ra'afe. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=365.05999999999995s)]
*  And from a political standpoint, I think what you're seeing here is, on the one hand, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=368.05999999999995s)]
*  domestically, President Biden is trying very hard to placate concerns from the Arab-American [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=373.82s)]
*  community. And on the other hand, he still wants to show himself as being a strong supporter [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=379.5s)]
*  of Israel. But there are certain things that Israel is doing that make it very difficult [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=383.94s)]
*  for the U.S. to, in essence, sell those policies or defend those policies in international [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=389.3s)]
*  forums like the UN or with European allies, the European Union, and with international [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=395.54s)]
*  public opinion at large. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=402.82s)]
*  And so this is where the United States finds itself. And it's going to be really difficult [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=404.18s)]
*  for them to be with the United States to be in lockstep with Israel at this particular juncture. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=409.82s)]
*  Let's talk about the aid situation. So news today that some of the equipment for this new floating [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=415.5s)]
*  pier is actually on its way to Gaza. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=419.38s)]
*  So the Pentagon has said that pier is going to take probably at least a month to construct. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=421.90000000000003s)]
*  It would require as many as a thousand troops to get that completed. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=426.78000000000003s)]
*  That's a long timeline. When we look at just how acute the needs are today, what do you [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=430.5s)]
*  make of that timeline? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=436.5s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a long timeline. I do think that it is possible to do some things [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=438.62s)]
*  a lot quicker than that timeline. For example, we know that there's a barge that's on its [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=444.62s)]
*  way from Cyprus right now to Gaza, or at least it's supposed to be on its way sometime today. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=450.14s)]
*  If that is the case, then that will help alleviate some of the things that are plaguing the population [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=456.86s)]
*  in Gaza in terms of hunger and possible famine. But the fact is that the military, the U.S. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=463.86s)]
*  military is going to have to move very quickly to install this floating pier and to make [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=471.06s)]
*  sure that the requisite number of ships can actually come in to provide the kind of support [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  that's necessary. I think it is something that should have been done a bit earlier, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=483.46000000000004s)]
*  but sometimes we just don't know how difficult a situation is or how dire a situation is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=488.82s)]
*  until we start seeing the pictures from places like Gaza. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=493.82s)]
*  One Qatari official said that this new Marine Corridor would bring some 200 truckloads of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=497.82s)]
*  aid via barge from Cyprus to Gaza each day. Do you think that is a realistic number? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=502.54s)]
*  I did a little quick math just based on how many containers can fit on barges and how [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=509.5s)]
*  many shipping containers can fit on trucks. And it does seem a realistic possibility, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=514.54s)]
*  assuming that all of the floats from places like Cyprus are going to be interrupted and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=520.26s)]
*  there are not going to be any security issues once everything gets to Gaza. So assuming all [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=527.46s)]
*  of that works perfectly, it is realistic that somewhere around the order of 200 truckloads [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=532.8199999999999s)]
*  of foodstuffs and other necessary equipment can get into Gaza using this method. Of course, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=538.58s)]
*  the other thing is I think before this crisis occurred on the 7th of October, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=546.42s)]
*  there were somewhere around 400 to 500 trucks that were needed just to sustain [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=552.18s)]
*  the Gaza population. So this is about a little less than half of what they really need in order [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=556.26s)]
*  to sustain themselves. Really quickly before I let you go, we have a scene analysis of satellite [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=562.42s)]
*  images which show Israel building this road that runs across the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEMZU2isSu4&t=568.02s)]
