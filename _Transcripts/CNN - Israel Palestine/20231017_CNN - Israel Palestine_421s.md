# Who is the leader of Hamas in Gaza?
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow)
*  I want to tell you about a man who is said to be the Hamas leader who is central to this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=0.0s)]
*  war and the release of hostages. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=3.74s)]
*  He's also a key target for Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Sam Kiley has more on the leader of Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=7.36s)]
*  SAM KILY, Israeli Prime Minister, Hamas, Gaza [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=10.6s)]
*  Israel wants this man dead. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=12.48s)]
*  Yahya El-Sinwa, the leader of Hamas in Gaza. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=14.24s)]
*  YAHYA EL-SINWA, Israeli Prime Minister, Hamas, Gaza [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=17.32s)]
*  In the face of evil, in the end, is Yahya El-Sinwa. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=18.32s)]
*  That man is in our sights, all his team are, and we will get to them. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=23.72s)]
*  He was first convicted in 1988 for the murder of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=28.88s)]
*  suspected of collaboration with Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=34.379999999999995s)]
*  And he spent two decades in an Israeli prison, studying his enemy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  The founder of Hamas' internal security force, he had hunted alleged collaborators with zeal. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=42.8s)]
*  And was among the movement's biggest prizes when over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners were [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=50.44s)]
*  released in 2011 for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held hostage in Gaza for five years. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=55.8s)]
*  He said, there is no doubt that this is a nationalistic moment par excellence. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=62.48s)]
*  It is one of the big strategic monuments in the history of our cause. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=69.08s)]
*  He quickly became head of Hamas' military wing and, on election to the Gaza leadership [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=74.6s)]
*  in 2017, effectively abolished its civilian branch. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=79.38s)]
*  Ostracized by Egypt over its support for political Islam, he repaired friendships with Cairo [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=84.36s)]
*  and built regional relationships that entrenched Hamas' power. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=90.36s)]
*  It really needed to have also good relations with the key Arab state that also shares the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=94.44s)]
*  only Arab border with the Gaza Strip and with Iran that could supply Hamas with military [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=100.88s)]
*  and logistical support. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=109.26s)]
*  Iran has poured military support into Hamas under him, and Qatar has been a major backer [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  of civilian projects. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  He was soon in Israel's crosshairs, quite literally. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=118.6s)]
*  The IDF tried to kill him in May 2021. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=121.91999999999999s)]
*  Ten days later, he laid out his strategy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=125.8s)]
*  He said, if the world doesn't take action to stop it, meaning Israel, there will be [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  a religious war in the region. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=134.2s)]
*  And he soon appeared in Gaza alongside Egypt's intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=137.17999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. is now relying on Egypt and Qatar as key players to try to secure the safe release [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  of Hamas' 200 captives. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=149.14s)]
*  Their main point of contact is likely Sinwa, unless Israel fulfills its promise to kill [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=152.29999999999998s)]
*  him. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=159.33999999999997s)]
*  Sam Kiley, CNN. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=160.33999999999997s)]
*  Well, a major unanswered question here is what was Hamas thinking with their terror [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=162.34s)]
*  attack? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=169.58s)]
*  That is the headline for an article by a journalist at The New Yorker who recently asked that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=170.58s)]
*  of a senior political Hamas official who is living in Doha in Qatar, David Kirkpatrick, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=173.7s)]
*  who co-authored that piece, has covered the region extensively. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=182.86s)]
*  David, the article you wrote is fascinating. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=183.86s)]
*  What were they thinking? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=187.82s)]
*  You know, the picture that emerged was desperation. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=192.29999999999998s)]
*  I should tell you that when my colleague, Adam Ragsdon, and I spoke to Moussa Abu Marzouk, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=195.98s)]
*  he was in pain to say, no, we have not despaired. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=204.98s)]
*  We're strong. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=207.22s)]
*  But the takeaway was that they basically feel like their backs are against the wall. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=208.42s)]
*  It was a familiar litany of grievances about the occupation, about Israeli settlements [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=213.66s)]
*  in the West Bank, about the management of the Al Aqsa Mosque, which is very important [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  to Palestinians and Muslims everywhere. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=222.86s)]
*  But added to that was an increased sense of desperation because of the right-wing government [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=226.38s)]
*  around Netanyahu, because of the messages that it's conveying about its lack of receptivity [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=231.06s)]
*  to any kind of Palestinian political entity alongside Israel, and also a sense of betrayal [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=236.10000000000002s)]
*  as the other Arab states more and more accommodate themselves to Israel, you know, begin to recognize [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=242.58s)]
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia, the most important of those, the latest in line to make an agreement [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=250.14s)]
*  like that. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=254.54s)]
*  So it's really a time when I think from his point of view, a little choice. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=255.54s)]
*  So for Hamas, it would be a success if you can talk about the murder of so many civilians [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=262.84s)]
*  as a success in their sick calculus. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=268.96s)]
*  If that Saudi deal does not go through, Saudi Arabia does not recognize the state of Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=272.6s)]
*  And also, they have these hostages who they have wanted to trade in the past and I assume [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=279.52s)]
*  want to trade now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=284.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's all true. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  And we pressed him on the sort of intelligible strategic reasons. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  Did you do this because of Saudi Arabia? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=293.52s)]
*  Did you do this for prisoner exchanges? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=295.2s)]
*  And there wasn't a clear answer because he was very frank that he didn't think they could [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=297.28s)]
*  dissuade Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=300.28s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is going to do what Saudi Arabia is going to do. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=301.28s)]
*  And yeah, I'm sure they'll want to exchange these prisoners. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  But at the same time, this attack has brought an enormous, enormous degree of pain on the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=307.56s)]
*  Gazan population, the Palestinians living in Gaza. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=314.64s)]
*  And when we pressed him about how the strategic advantages, the practical strategic advantage [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=318.2s)]
*  of this attack could justify that sacrifice, his answers were very abstract, very nebulous. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=322.88s)]
*  He was really looking towards a very, very distant horizon. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=328.76s)]
*  All he could say was, you know, for years they've been fighting on our territory and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=331.84s)]
*  killing us. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=336.04s)]
*  This time we're fighting on their territory for the first time, which is a, you know, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=337.04s)]
*  it's a symbolic victory of sorts, but it's not much. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  We should point out and you point this out in the article in The New Yorker, which I [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=347.32s)]
*  encourage people to read. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=350.66s)]
*  He lied to you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  I mean, he denies that civilians were targeted. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  He denies that the women and children were slaughtered. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=355.48s)]
*  He did say some things which we found unconvincing about that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=361.04s)]
*  He said, you know, after the Hamas fighters came in, others came in afterwards, and it [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=364.52s)]
*  was those others who did these misdeeds. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=371.08s)]
*  I didn't find that very convincing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=372.08s)]
*  He's certainly not the first military leader to try to spin in that way. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  Is it clear to you if Hamas expects Hezbollah to open up a second front in this war? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  It was clear from what he said that they do not. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=387.11999999999995s)]
*  You know, obviously this is a war. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  There's lots of misinformation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=391.52s)]
*  But he was he seemed very candid. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=393.08s)]
*  We said, you know, what if Hezbollah enters this war? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=395.0s)]
*  What if it becomes a regional conflict? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=397.44s)]
*  And he said, quite frankly, we wish, you know, if only it could become a regional conflict, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=398.84s)]
*  we would love that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=403.0s)]
*  But we don't see any sign of it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=404.12s)]
*  Hezbollah is going to more or less abide by its ceasefire with Israel, he said. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=406.08s)]
*  And he did not expect this war to expand on that other front. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=411.53999999999996s)]
*  David Karpatri, thank you so much. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=418.12s)]
*  It's good to have you on the program again. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfmV0qOQow&t=419.44s)]
