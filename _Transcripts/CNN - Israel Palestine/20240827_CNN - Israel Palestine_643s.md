# Israel rescues 52-year-old hostage held by Hamas in Gaza in ‘complex operation’
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE)
*  Breaking news to CNN, the Israeli military has just announced a hostage has been rescued from Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=0.0s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond is following the story. Jeremy, what do we know? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=5.76s)]
*  Yeah, we've just learned that a hostage who has been held by Hamas since October 7th has been [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=11.84s)]
*  rescued in an Israeli military operation. Israeli military just released the details that Kaid [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=17.68s)]
*  Farhan Al-Khadi, a 52-year-old Bedouin man from Israel, was rescued in an operation, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=24.0s)]
*  a joint operation, by the Israeli military and the Israeli intelligence service, the Shin Bet. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=32.64s)]
*  They say that he was rescued by Shayetet 13, that's the Israeli equivalent of the Navy Seals, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  as well as by Yahalom and Shin Bet forces under the command of the 162nd Division. This happened [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=45.6s)]
*  in the southern Gaza Strip and that is the extent of the details that we have for now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=53.6s)]
*  He is only one of a handful of Israeli hostages who have actually been rescued in Israeli military [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=60.56s)]
*  operations in Gaza. I believe that there have been at least six others so far who have been rescued [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=67.44s)]
*  by the Israeli military, most of the hostages of course, who have actually gotten out of Gaza, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=73.44s)]
*  got out during that November week-long truce. But no doubt that this is incredible news for [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=78.08s)]
*  his family, this 52-year-old man, Kaid Farhan Al-Khadi, he was actually working as a security [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=84.0s)]
*  guard near the Gaza border on the morning of October 7th and that is when he was taken captive [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=89.6s)]
*  by Hamas and whisked away into the Gaza Strip. He has been there now for the last 10 and a half [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=95.84s)]
*  months as a captive of Hamas, so obviously some very rare and very good news today for him and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=104.24s)]
*  his family. Ten and a half months in captivity, it's just incredible and of course we'll, you know, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  are awaiting the details of this operation as to how they were able to pinpoint where he was. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=116.08s)]
*  In terms of, you know, the ongoing, the hostage release and ceasefire talks that remain ongoing, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=122.96s)]
*  do you see this rescue operation impacting the talks in any way, Jeremy? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=130.8s)]
*  It is really difficult to know the extent to which this will actually impact the talks. I mean, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  anytime something happens on the ground, whether it is a strike in Gaza, rescue operation, anything [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  else, it can have some kind of an impact, if not on the talks themselves, then certainly on the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  psychology of the populations that are being represented by the different parties at the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  negotiating table. And this will be a boost, of course, for Israeli morale to see that another [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=159.52s)]
*  hostage has indeed been rescued from captivity. But I think that all of the families of the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=164.96s)]
*  hostages are pretty clear-eyed at this point, that they are not counting on additional Israeli [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=169.92s)]
*  rescue operations to get all of their loved ones out of Gaza. They know and certainly a big portion [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=174.72s)]
*  of the Israeli government knows that it is ultimately a deal with Hamas that will lead to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=181.2s)]
*  the release of the remaining hostages. And the question is, can that happen quickly enough for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=186.32s)]
*  more of them to come home alive rather than dead, as we have seen a number of the bodies of Israeli [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=191.84s)]
*  hostages, some of whom died only in recent months, being brought back to Israel in body bags, sadly, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=197.84s)]
*  rather than coming home alive. We know that those negotiations are still ongoing at a technical [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=205.84s)]
*  level in Cairo right now. The United States has said that there has been significant progress over [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=210.56s)]
*  the weekend towards a deal, but it is still very difficult to know whether or not these talks will [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  actually lead to an agreement that would see dozens more hostages released. Yeah, the last [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=222.64000000000001s)]
*  rescue that we saw happened in June where we, four captives were released and that came [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=227.12s)]
*  in June. We have seen a major Israeli air and ground offensive where dozens of people [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=232.8s)]
*  were killed as a result. Are we getting any more information about this hostage rescue operation, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=239.68s)]
*  Jeremy? As of now, no. I mean, we are looking, one of the things that I will be looking for as well [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=245.28s)]
*  is to see, you know, how heavy was this Israeli military operation in terms of collateral damage [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=252.88000000000002s)]
*  and casualties on the ground. We have seen in the past that when the Israeli military [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=258.88s)]
*  does carry out these rescue operations, they tend to do quite a bit of damage on the ground, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=263.12s)]
*  bombing the area in order to try and send their special forces in safely to rescue these hostages. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=268.64s)]
*  But as we saw in the previous instance, of course, of those four hostages who were rescued back in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=274.8s)]
*  June, dozens of Palestinians on the ground were killed, including a number of civilians who were [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=280.16s)]
*  part of that death toll. All right, Jeremy Diamond, I know this is a developing story. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=287.12s)]
*  We have Gideon Levy with us now from Haaretz to talk more about this. Jeremy, thank you so much [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=293.2s)]
*  for getting up quickly for that report. First off, Gideon, please give me your reaction [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=299.12s)]
*  to this latest hostage rescue operation. What do you know? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=304.24s)]
*  First of all, it's a very happy news. I mean, on a humanitarian basis, everyone is something, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=308.48s)]
*  and in this case, it's a Bedouin of 53, I think. He got a granddaughter by the time that he was [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=318.24s)]
*  in captivity. And, you know, each hostage is a whole world, but it shouldn't change our minds. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  The hostages will not be released by such operations here and there, here and body, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=335.44s)]
*  there, a living hostage, but the hostage will be released only in a deal which will end this war. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=341.92s)]
*  There are no shortcuts. And I'll ask you the question that I asked Jeremy about, you know, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=349.52s)]
*  how do you see these rescue operations? The last one in June, we saw quite a high number of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=357.12s)]
*  casualties on the Palestinian side. How do you see these hostage rescue operations potentially [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=363.12s)]
*  impacting the ongoing talks where we know there are huge sticking points? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=369.36s)]
*  First of all, the ongoing talks are leading to nowhere, so it's not much to put in risk. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=375.76s)]
*  But what is in risk obviously are lives of innocent Palestinians in those operations. I [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=382.72s)]
*  don't know about this one. The last operation in which there were only bodies brought to Israel, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=388.48s)]
*  dozens of Palestinians paid in their lives. And this is obviously unacceptable, especially when [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=394.8s)]
*  it is about bodies, dead bodies and not living hostages. In this case, I don't know the details [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=401.76s)]
*  yet because they are not very clear, but I hope that not too many Palestinians paid in their lives. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=408.16s)]
*  They don't deserve it. If you were just joining us, we're following breaking news. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=413.68s)]
*  We have just learned that a hostage who was abducted by Hamas on October 7th has been rescued, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=418.56s)]
*  not released, rescued by the Israeli military. This happened today. His name is Kaid Farhan Al-Khadi. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=425.2s)]
*  He is 52 years old as we understand it, and he was rescued by the 401st Brigade and the ISA forces. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=435.28s)]
*  Moments ago, we heard from a spokesman from the Israeli government. Listen. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=445.52s)]
*  He's in a stable medical condition and is being transferred for medical checks right now [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=451.84s)]
*  at an Israeli hospital. His overjoyed family has been updated with the details, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=459.28s)]
*  and the IDF is accompanying them at this crucial moment. Israeli security forces will [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=467.68s)]
*  continue to operate with all means necessary, all means necessary to bring home all of our hostages. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=474.8s)]
*  This is truly uplifting news for everyone that cares about the lives of our people here in Israel [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=483.12s)]
*  and I think right-thinking people around the world. It's incredible to hear he is in stable [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=490.16s)]
*  condition. This is the 52-year-old man who was rescued. Jim Shutow is in Tel Aviv with the latest. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=497.36s)]
*  What do we know? I know it's early days and we're just getting the information and a lot of questions [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=504.71999999999997s)]
*  about the rescue operation itself, but what do we know about the man who is now a free man? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  Listen, some rare good news in this conflict given that we're close to 11 months out since [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=516.48s)]
*  the attacks on October 7th and so many families in Israel suffering, waiting for news of their [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=520.64s)]
*  loved ones. Here's what we know about this rescued hostage, 52 years old, Kaid Farhan Al-Khadi. He was [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=525.84s)]
*  a Bedouin and according to the hostages family forum, he was abducted on October 7th [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=533.36s)]
*  from a security job at Kibbutz Magen down in the south of course, close to Gaza. You heard [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=540.08s)]
*  the Israeli government spokesman there saying that his family has now been given the good news [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=546.64s)]
*  that he is in stable medical condition and they are continuing to do medical checks on him at a [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=551.44s)]
*  hospital. It is, as I say, rare news to speak of a live rescue of a hostage all these months later. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=558.0s)]
*  The last one was on June 8th when four hostages were rescued from central Gaza. This operation [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=564.8s)]
*  taking place in southern Gaza involving both regular military units and Israeli special forces. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=570.56s)]
*  They have not released further details as to exactly how they managed to gain his safety, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=576.08s)]
*  but again you have to go back to June 8th, so a number of months to a successful rescue operation. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=582.72s)]
*  Of course, just last week six hostages' bodies were recovered from Gaza. Of course, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=587.36s)]
*  not the good news that these hostage families want to hear. That leaves the total at 108, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=594.64s)]
*  108 that are still remaining there and Israeli government officials have acknowledged that many [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=599.52s)]
*  of those 108, though they have not specified a number, are no longer alive. The hostage [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=604.0s)]
*  forum has released a statement saying that this is nothing short of miraculous. They go on to say [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=610.16s)]
*  that military operations alone cannot be expected to gain the freedom of all these hostages. Of [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=616.24s)]
*  course, that speaks to the tension ongoing here between hostage families and the government [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=621.84s)]
*  because hostage families have been quite impatient for a deal, a ceasefire and hostage release deal, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=626.8s)]
*  to gain the release of the other remaining hostages or at least a large number of the [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=632.48s)]
*  other remaining hostages. But at least today for one family there is good news. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmnQ8h7aVyE&t=638.72s)]
