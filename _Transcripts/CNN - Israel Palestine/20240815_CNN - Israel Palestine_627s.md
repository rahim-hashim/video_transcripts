# Her daughter was killed by Hamas on October 7th. Hear why she hasn’t visited her grave
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y)
*  We have a powerful interview to share with you now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I first spoke with Gali Edan when I was in Israel last November. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=2.64s)]
*  Her 18-year-old daughter Mayan was murdered by Hamas on October 7th in front of her family. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=7.0s)]
*  Hamas then held the Edans at gunpoint on the floor of their kitchen for hours, live streaming [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=12.76s)]
*  the whole thing on Facebook. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=18.64s)]
*  The ordeal ended with Hamas kidnapping Gali's husband, Tzachi. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=20.82s)]
*  Gali and I spoke again in northern Israel this week. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  We talked at length about the pain she's endured, her plea for officials to reach a hostage [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=28.4s)]
*  deal and her hope that she will see her husband alive again. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=33.12s)]
*  Thank you very much for talking to us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=37.76s)]
*  It's been almost a year since we last had this conversation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=41.44s)]
*  First of all, how are you doing? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=45.64s)]
*  Good question. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  In my worst nightmares, I wouldn't believe that we are meeting in this situation where [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=51.64s)]
*  nothing changed actually. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=58.88s)]
*  Tzachi is still in the Hamas. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=61.44s)]
*  Tzachi Edan, your husband, 50 years old, he was kidnapped by Hamas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=63.88s)]
*  And your daughter Mayan, 18 years old, she was murdered that day. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=69.68s)]
*  And you've been living with both of those enormous, enormous tragedies all this time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=74.2s)]
*  Yes, it's been 313 days of hell. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=80.68s)]
*  We are out of breath, just like them, in captivity and being hostage by Hamas, which are terrorists [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=87.68s)]
*  and murderers. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  He was kidnapped and taken to Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=101.5s)]
*  What's the latest you've heard about his condition? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=104.56s)]
*  The latest was at the end of November, when the release of the hostages, the last release [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=108.24s)]
*  of hostages from Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  I had an eyewitness say that she was with him for a few, for a day or two, and she talked [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=122.28s)]
*  to him and he was really emotionally down and thinking about Mayan and what happened [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=132.48s)]
*  and that he misses all. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=143.44s)]
*  I don't know if he knows if we're okay. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=146.32s)]
*  And it was a really long time ago that day that she told me that she saw him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=150.16s)]
*  It's unimaginable that we are sitting right now after this time and nothing changed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=156.64s)]
*  He's not back. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=164.55999999999997s)]
*  They are not back. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=165.55999999999997s)]
*  They are not all back. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=166.55999999999997s)]
*  It's unthinkable. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=169.44s)]
*  It's unthinkable and unbearable. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=171.92s)]
*  And we live in this in this in this audacity every day, every hour, thinking about our [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=174.08s)]
*  loved ones in in hostage conditions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  You have any hope that these negotiations which are taking place and are about to resume [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=188.72000000000003s)]
*  will result in a ceasefire and be the release of the hostages, including your husband? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=194.12s)]
*  Most definitely. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  The only way that Tzachi and 114 other hostages can come back, some alive, some dead for a [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=204.2s)]
*  proper barrier is the only way is in a deal. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  The only way is in a deal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=221.2s)]
*  You cannot make an army and you know, a mission to save them all. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=222.32s)]
*  You cannot do that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=233.22s)]
*  Well, further complicating this whole situation now is the possibility that Iran might attack [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=234.5s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=240.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=241.14s)]
*  And that could happen within days. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=242.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=243.14s)]
*  And presumably that would undermine whatever negotiations might be taking place for a ceasefire [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=244.14s)]
*  and a hostage release. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=249.1s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=250.38s)]
*  It's like it's it's I'm trying not to be I'm trying to filter the ongoing threats from [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=251.9s)]
*  all over and keep my eye on the hostages and on Tzachi, my husband, my loved one, my better [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=261.28s)]
*  half. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=269.4s)]
*  The threat is here and I think it's been ongoing for a few months. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=273.4s)]
*  It's not a new thing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=280.46s)]
*  I think they need to close this deal so all the all the Middle East can be relaxed from [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=282.68s)]
*  this situation because the situation is burning. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  And if the Middle East will become a battle zone, it will be a third world war. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=299.0s)]
*  I don't see it. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=306.22s)]
*  It will take all the allies into the situation. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=308.62s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=314.46000000000004s)]
*  What do you miss most about Tzachi, your husband? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=316.5s)]
*  I miss his voice. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=320.5s)]
*  And I miss his hugs. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=324.66s)]
*  And I miss the time that we have together and I miss him joking with the kids and laughing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=328.84s)]
*  and making dinner with him and watching a movie, taking a walk. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=341.08s)]
*  I miss every little thing. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=348.44s)]
*  It's been too long. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=351.17999999999995s)]
*  It's been too long. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=353.08s)]
*  It's unbearable. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  We have no air anymore. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=356.84s)]
*  They have to come back. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  It's part of us. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  And your daughter, Mayan, she was killed, murdered that day. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=365.41999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=369.44s)]
*  You miss her obviously every day too. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=370.44s)]
*  I'll tell you something. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=372.96s)]
*  I tell you something that is I cannot grieve about Mayan yet because I'm in an ongoing [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=377.86s)]
*  war to save my husband. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=389.3s)]
*  I didn't want to see her grave. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=393.1s)]
*  I couldn't. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=396.42s)]
*  And it's going to be a year. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=397.42s)]
*  And I need to go and see her. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=400.1s)]
*  And I can't. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=404.02000000000004s)]
*  I need Zachy to be here and we need to do it together. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=405.22s)]
*  He needs to see her grave. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=410.1s)]
*  He needs to grieve with me. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=412.18s)]
*  We need to hold each other through this. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=414.58s)]
*  And as all of us know, October 7th, it's almost a year, was the worst day of Jews being murdered [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=419.94s)]
*  since the Holocaust. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=429.66s)]
*  It's interesting that you are saying, because today I thought that I think the mark, the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=430.66s)]
*  horrific marks of Jewish is the Holocaust and the 7th of October. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=436.98s)]
*  You're so right. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=443.86s)]
*  This is, I think it will be staying in Israeli history and it will be worse if the hostages [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=446.70000000000005s)]
*  will not come back. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=458.58000000000004s)]
*  And I will not, I will not allow them to sacrifice my husband for the sake of war. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  How are your other children dealing with all this now? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=468.42s)]
*  They're young kids. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=474.42s)]
*  They are young. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=476.42s)]
*  Sharon is 16. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=477.42s)]
*  She turned 16. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=479.3s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=481.42s)]
*  This year it has passed. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=482.42s)]
*  And Ye'el is 12 and Shachar is 10. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=484.94s)]
*  There are some good days and some bad days. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=490.42s)]
*  We are all talking about Maayan all the time. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=495.42s)]
*  They have some times that are breaking down and crying and missing their sister. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=500.42s)]
*  And a few days ago, Sharon came to my room crying in the middle of the night and said, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=506.42s)]
*  I want my daddy. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  I want dad here. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=514.4200000000001s)]
*  I miss Maayan and I want dad here. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=516.4200000000001s)]
*  And you need to hug her. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=520.42s)]
*  Just what can I say to her? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=524.42s)]
*  What can I say to her? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=527.42s)]
*  What answer is there? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=529.42s)]
*  I can't bring her her dad. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=531.42s)]
*  I wish I could. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=534.42s)]
*  I would have in any means. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=536.42s)]
*  I need the government and everybody that are in the doing of this deal to bring Tzachi [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=539.42s)]
*  home alive like he was taken. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=548.42s)]
*  He was taken alive. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=551.42s)]
*  He needs to come back alive. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=554.42s)]
*  I hope he does. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=557.42s)]
*  I hope he comes back soon. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=559.42s)]
*  And when he does, I hope to come and meet him. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=560.42s)]
*  I promised you that when he comes back, we'll do a recap. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=562.42s)]
*  Good. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=568.42s)]
*  I'd like to talk to him. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=569.42s)]
*  I'm keeping the hope. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=570.42s)]

*  Yeah, I know. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=575.42s)]
*  And we are 313 days after. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=576.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's a long time. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=579.42s)]

*  It's unbearable. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=583.42s)]

*  running toward him and Jay running toward him. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=603.42s)]
*  And it's going to be a strong reunion. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=608.42s)]
*  And we need this circle to be closed. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=612.42s)]
*  Let's hope it ends in the heart. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBgdGMsrY_Y&t=616.42s)]
