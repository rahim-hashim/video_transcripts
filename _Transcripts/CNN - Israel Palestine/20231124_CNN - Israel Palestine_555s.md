# Young girl exits ambulance at Rafah crossing amid hostage release
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8)
*  The number of ambulances there shows you obviously the concern for the well-being of each of these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=0.0s)]
*  individual hostages being released right now. There's Rafa. Hang on. There's a little girl. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=6.24s)]
*  These are live pictures. This is the first time we're seeing that right now and for the first time [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=22.8s)]
*  we just saw a little girl getting out of one of those ambulances and walking into a building there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=26.64s)]
*  Could have been that that was one of the Israeli hostages, the young children, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=33.44s)]
*  released not long ago as part of this deal. Yeah, John, as we're watching all of this play out and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=38.24s)]
*  waiting for the identities of these hostages to be confirmed by Israel, which they say that they'll [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  do once they're safely back in Israel, though we're watching several of them get out of these [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=51.28s)]
*  emergency vehicles, we're also learning more about who they are. And I'm told by an Israeli [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=55.68s)]
*  source that most of these hostages, not all of them, we don't know that exactly, but a majority [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=61.12s)]
*  of the hostages that have been released just now by Hamas from Gaza are from kibbutz near Oz. And [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  on October 7th, that was a kibbutz that saw a lot of devastation in the October 7th attack. I believe [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=73.76s)]
*  it was estimated that a quarter of the population of the several hundred people who lived there [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=80.24s)]
*  were either murdered or kidnapped into Gaza. And they saw, I mean, it was the kibbutz where they [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  burned basically the kindergarten to the ground. They went into homes. You heard the testaments [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  from the people who did survive that attack about just how devastating it was that day and how it [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  saw some of the worst violence on October 7th. John, we're now seeing as we're hearing that they [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=102.24s)]
*  are from kibbutz near Oz, the majority of these hostages right now, we are watching [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=108.8s)]
*  a line of people now boarding. They'd gone inside after getting out, now getting onto a bus. You can [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=113.28s)]
*  see an elderly woman. She is stepping into that white bus with assistance right here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=118.08s)]
*  And you see a line of people behind her, some men, another woman. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=124.08s)]
*  We believe we saw a child at the beginning of the line. It's unclear if it was the same child [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=133.76s)]
*  that we saw earlier. We know that we have heard from Egyptian sources that several of the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=138.96s)]
*  hostages who are being released today, not just those 13 Israeli hostages, also several [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=145.44s)]
*  Thai nationals as well who were kidnapped by Hamas on that day. And they appear to be boarding this [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=149.44s)]
*  bus right in front of us, John. Yeah. So again, the question is, what's next? Yeah, 13 Israeli [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=155.84s)]
*  hostages, 10 Thai hostages, one Filipino hostage. We saw a number of them, but by no means all, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=162.48s)]
*  boarding that bus right there. Presumably some are also receiving medical care, might be in the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  ambulances there. We are told that the young girl that we had seen earlier was at the front of the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  line. We're going to try to get a look at that again. But boarding that bus, we did clearly see [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=177.2s)]
*  one child, some older women, and then men. Okay, let's see. We're going to see those pictures again. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=182.32s)]
*  Let's take a look at those pictures again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=189.68s)]
*  At the front of the line there, you saw a younger girl, an older woman. Here's a different vantage [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=200.8s)]
*  point there. A couple older women there. And now what appeared to be a number of the Thai hostages [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=205.76s)]
*  there, 10 Thai hostages and one Filipino hostage, perhaps boarding this bus that is the Rafa crossing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=212.48s)]
*  We can't be sure where that bus will go, but it's possible it will head not far. We're talking about [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  a mere number of a small handful of kilometers south to the Kerem Shalom crossing. And from there, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=227.6s)]
*  it would enter Israel. They're in Egypt right now. This group of hostages there, apparently the Thai [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=234.16s)]
*  men and also perhaps one Filipino hostage boarding that bus, Kaitlyn, were earlier. We did see the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=241.04s)]
*  first person to get on was that girl, that young girl that we saw now free after 48 days in captivity. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=248.0s)]
*  What's next for this bus? We are not sure, but within the next several hours, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=259.36s)]
*  all of those people we presume will be back inside Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=265.2s)]
*  Yeah, we believe the next stop for that bus is going to be here in Israel where there's a number [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=268.96s)]
*  of hospitals that are preparing to receive them. I mean, they are this reintegration process that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=276.64s)]
*  these hostages are going to have to go through isn't just about their physical well-being, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  these medical checkups, but also meeting with therapists and officials here to talk about what [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=287.12s)]
*  they've seen, what they've experienced in these 48 days that they have been held. These people have [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=294.88s)]
*  not known freedom since October the 7th, since they were kidnapped by Hamas into Gaza, where [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=300.08s)]
*  we know from at least two of the hostages who were previously released, they were in a complex [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=306.08s)]
*  tunnel system underground. And they had been underground for so long that when they were [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=311.36s)]
*  released on light, natural light, sunlight shocked them because they just hadn't seen it in so long. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=315.92s)]
*  And so that's the kind of mindset that so many of these people that you're seeing now have gone [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=322.72s)]
*  through, where I mean, there are major questions about what else those conditions looked like, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=327.6s)]
*  but we do know what we've heard from other hostages who have been released. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  One thing that we were told is as soon as these hostages, the Israeli hostages at least made it [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=336.32000000000005s)]
*  to the border, they were going to try to facilitate a phone call with their family members. They [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=341.68s)]
*  weren't able to immediately be reunited with them, but they at least wanted them to have that moment, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=345.68s)]
*  to have that first conversation with a loved one that they have not been able to have for so long. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=350.4s)]
*  And it's just a huge sigh of relief for so many of these families to see this actually unfolding [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=356.08s)]
*  and obviously still waiting for them to actually get here into Israel. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  One of the places that we do expect the hostages to go soon, and that's the Hatzareem Air Base you [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=368.4s)]
*  can see inside Israel. So Rafa here and then presumably they'll move somewhere back into [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=374.64s)]
*  Israel, either crossing here or here, and then travel to the Hatzareem Air Base. That's where [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  our Matthew Chance is with the latest on what you're seeing. Matthew. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=385.68s)]
*  That's right, John. Here at the Hatzareem Air Base preparations have been underway for some time [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=392.0s)]
*  to cater for this arrival, this first stop in the arrival of these 13 Israeli hostages, perhaps the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  nationals from Thailand and the Philippines as well, although it's unclear whether they'll be [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=404.48s)]
*  coming directly here as well. We're trying to get clarification on that. But yes, it's going to be a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=408.32s)]
*  sensitive operation. You saw those people heading towards the bus in the live video that we've been [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  watching. And our understanding, according to Israeli military officials on the ground here at [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=420.48s)]
*  the air base that have been speaking to us, are saying that the plan at the moment is for these [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=425.68s)]
*  hostages to be driven, these freed hostages to be driven by road in those buses to this air base. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=431.52s)]
*  The reason they're doing that, they said, is because helicopter flights can be scary and they [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  don't want to further traumatize anybody who hasn't been on a helicopter before. That's the reason they [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=445.35999999999996s)]
*  said they're going to drive them by road. And so we'll see how that develops. Obviously this is a [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=449.76s)]
*  fast changing situation on the ground and that plan could change. But whether they come here by [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=455.44s)]
*  bus or whether they're flown here in helicopters, this is the place where we understand they will [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=461.52s)]
*  be received by, you know, get initial checkups. They'll be able to make phone calls to their [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=467.2s)]
*  family members. They'll be properly looked at medically and psychologically to assess [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=473.28s)]
*  what their immediate needs are, given food and drinks, a change of clothes if that's necessary [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=478.24s)]
*  as well. It's not clear whether they're still in the same clothes, for instance, that they were in [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=483.28s)]
*  when they were abducted so violently back on October the 7th. So they're going to be looked at [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=487.52s)]
*  here. They're also shower facilities, things like that. After that they're going to be loaded onto [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=492.4s)]
*  helicopters and taken to various hospitals around the country, particularly close to Tel Aviv, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=497.44s)]
*  depending on what their exact medical needs are. Now in terms of the timing on that, once the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  the hostages, if they come by road, once they get to the border of Israel, it's going to take [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=512.16s)]
*  about an hour because it's about 30 miles away, a bit longer than that perhaps, to the border, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=516.64s)]
*  depending on where they come across to this base. And then they're going to be processed for between [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=521.44s)]
*  half an hour and two hours, depending on their specific needs. And so we're bracing ourselves [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=526.56s)]
*  for several hours now before these people arrive here, are processed, and then finally board those [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=535.12s)]
*  helicopters that are waiting for them here and choppered to the hospitals elsewhere in the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=542.08s)]
*  country. But again, a very sensitive, delicate, anxious period underway right now. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvYqPJeFUV8&t=548.64s)]
