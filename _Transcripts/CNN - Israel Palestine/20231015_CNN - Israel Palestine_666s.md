# 'You don't compliment any of them': Haley responds to Trump's Hamas comment
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM)
*  81% of Americans over the age of 65 feel the response by the Israeli government is fully justified, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=0.0s)]
*  but just 27% of Americans 18 to 34 years old feel that way. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=6.1000000000000005s)]
*  The humanitarian crisis is also top of mind for many Americans. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=12.06s)]
*  71% of Americans feel a lot of sympathy for the people of Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=14.9s)]
*  41% feel a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=19.06s)]
*  Former UN ambassador and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=22.36s)]
*  Ambassador Haley, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  If you were president right now, would you consider using the U.S. special operations [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=29.6s)]
*  to rescue American hostages being held in Gaza? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=36.6s)]
*  You just heard Jake Sullivan say that one of the complications with that is we don't [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=40.08s)]
*  know exactly where the hostages are, but I'm wondering how much you would consider such a thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Jake. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=50.0s)]
*  You know, I think it's important you have to tell hard truths to Americans. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=51.2s)]
*  And when you're talking about this, you know, when you showed those percentages of what [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  people think and what they think we should do, you have to be honest with them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  This is messy, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we desperately want to get those American hostages out. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=63.6s)]
*  But if you saw those kids in the hands of those terrorists, like with a mom heart, it [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=67.4s)]
*  made me sick to my stomach for all those parents having to see their children in those terrorists' [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=73.08s)]
*  hands. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=77.84s)]
*  So of course we want them out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=78.84s)]
*  But why isn't it so easy that we can do that? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  It's because we don't know where they are. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=83.4s)]
*  And I have been in those tunnels that are massive, that are sophisticated, and that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  Hamas uses to hide equipment and ammunition and to do their dirty work and maybe to have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=91.12s)]
*  those hostages. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=96.56s)]
*  But where are those tunnels? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=97.56s)]
*  They're underneath hospitals. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  They're underneath schools. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=100.4s)]
*  They're in hard-to-find places. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=101.98s)]
*  So this is incredibly tough. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  I feel for the Israeli families. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=105.2s)]
*  I feel for the American families. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=108.04s)]
*  And I feel for any other families who've lost a loved one or have someone in a hostage situation [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=110.12s)]
*  because it's really bleak right now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  And it's hard for anyone to feel good about this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=117.36s)]
*  Yeah, we just showed images that your office gave us of when you visited Israel in 2017 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=119.28s)]
*  and the IDF took you to those tunnels near the Kibbutz in Ashdod. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=124.8s)]
*  You said that because those tunnels in Gaza are near civilian sites, it's going to get [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=128.8s)]
*  bad. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=131.76s)]
*  It's already pretty bad, obviously. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=132.76s)]
*  There are more than 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=134.08s)]
*  More than half of them are children. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=137.4s)]
*  Do you think the U.S., Israel, Egypt needs to be doing more to help these innocent Palestinian [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=139.44s)]
*  civilians get out of harm's way? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=145.44s)]
*  Although you just heard Jake Sullivan say one of the problems is Hamas is keeping the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=146.76s)]
*  civilians in Gaza. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=153.2s)]
*  They don't want them to leave. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=154.6s)]
*  There are a couple of things at play here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is going to do everything they can to not have them leave because guess what? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=160.52s)]
*  They want them all to die. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=165.0s)]
*  One, they want to use them as human shields, but two, they want to blame Israel and show [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=167.2s)]
*  images of dead children and say look at what Israel did. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=169.72s)]
*  But don't ever forget what Hamas did. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=173.23999999999998s)]
*  Don't ever forget those girls running for their life. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=175.28s)]
*  Don't ever forget those babies that were killed in cribs. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  Don't ever forget the people that they were dragging through the streets. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=181.06s)]
*  And what were they saying, Jake? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=183.76s)]
*  They were saying death to Israel, death to America. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=184.76s)]
*  That's who we're dealing with. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=187.92s)]
*  But I dealt with this at the United Nations. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=189.1s)]
*  You're going to hear all of those Arab countries vilify Israel for what's about to happen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=191.64s)]
*  You're going to hear all of them say how dare you not do more for the Palestinian people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=202.32s)]
*  We should care about the Palestinian citizens, especially the innocent ones, because they [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=203.32s)]
*  didn't ask for this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=207.16s)]
*  But where are the Arab countries? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=210.6s)]
*  Where is Qatar? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=211.6s)]
*  Where is Lebanon? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=212.6s)]
*  Where is Jordan? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=213.6s)]
*  Where is Egypt? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=214.6s)]
*  Do you know we give Egypt over a billion dollars a year? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=215.6s)]
*  Why aren't they opening the gates? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=218.83999999999997s)]
*  Why aren't they taking the Palestinians? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=221.0s)]
*  You know why? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=222.0s)]
*  Because they know they can't vet them and they don't want Hamas in their neighborhood. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=223.28s)]
*  So why would Israel want them in their neighborhood? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=227.88s)]
*  So let's be honest with what's going on. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  The Arab countries aren't doing anything to help the Palestinians because they don't trust [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=233.16s)]
*  who is right, who is good, who is evil, and they don't want it in their country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=237.68s)]
*  So they're going to come and blame America. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=242.42s)]
*  They're going to come and blame Israel. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=244.68s)]
*  And don't fall for it because they have the ability to fix all of this if they wanted [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=246.64s)]
*  to. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=251.56s)]
*  They have the ability to go in and tell Hamas right now to stop what they're doing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=252.56s)]
*  They have the ability to tell Hamas to let those people out. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=257.2s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=260.32s)]
*  Qatar is going to continue to work with Hamas and their leadership. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=261.32s)]
*  Iran's going to continue to fund all of this and not say anything. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=265.0s)]
*  And who's silent? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=267.96s)]
*  Every one of those Arab countries are going to be silent. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=269.28s)]
*  So expect for the finger to point to Israel and the finger's going to point to America. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=272.16s)]
*  I want you to take a listen to this statement that Governor Ron DeSantis made about all, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=277.72s)]
*  I guess he's talking about all of the 2.3 million Palestinians. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=284.8s)]
*  He said this on the campaign trail in Iowa yesterday. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=289.76000000000005s)]
*  If you look at how they behave, not all of them are Hamas, but they are all anti-Semitic. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=293.92s)]
*  None of them believe in Israel's right to exist. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=300.56s)]
*  Now just for our viewers at a vacation, according to recent polling earlier this year from the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=303.6s)]
*  Washington Institute, which is a pro-Israel group, using the polling of a Palestinian [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=309.4s)]
*  Center for Public Opinion, 62% of Gazans wanted the ceasefire with Israel to stay in place. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=314.84000000000003s)]
*  50% of Gazans want Hamas to stop calling for Israel's destruction, want Hamas to accept [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=321.52s)]
*  a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=326.76s)]
*  70% of Gazans wanted the Palestinian Authority from the West Bank to take over Gaza. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=330.44s)]
*  So I'm not really certain that Governor DeSantis has a real read on the difference between [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=336.12s)]
*  Hamas and the people of Gaza. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=340.64s)]
*  What was your response when you heard what Governor DeSantis said? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, I dealt with this every day for two years. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=349.32s)]
*  And what I can tell you is you have to realize that whether we're talking about Gazans and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=353.0s)]
*  Palestinians, all of them don't, you've got half of them at the time that I was there, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=358.08s)]
*  didn't want to be under Hamas' rule. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=364.44s)]
*  They didn't want to have terrorists overseeing them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=366.52s)]
*  They knew that they were living a terrible life because of Hamas. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=368.72s)]
*  You had the other half that supported Hamas and wanted to be a part of that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=372.52s)]
*  We see that with Iran too. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=375.84s)]
*  The Iranian people don't want to be under that Iranian regime. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=377.62s)]
*  We saw what happened to Hamas, Amini. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=381.88s)]
*  We saw how they treat them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=383.64s)]
*  There are so many of these people who want to be free from this terrorist rule. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=385.8s)]
*  They want to be free from all of that. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=390.12s)]
*  And America's always been sympathetic to the fact that you can separate civilians from [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=391.88s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=396.84s)]
*  And that's what we have to do. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=397.84s)]
*  But right now, we can never take our eyes off of the terrorists. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=398.84s)]
*  I mean, what Hamas did was beyond thuggish, brutal and sick. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=401.56s)]
*  What the Iranian regime is doing to help them is terrible. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=406.72s)]
*  Let's look back at what did Biden do. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=411.0s)]
*  Biden turned around and fell all over himself to get into the Iran deal. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=414.24s)]
*  Obama did it before that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=417.24s)]
*  You gave all of this money. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=418.64000000000004s)]
*  And what did you do? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=420.0s)]
*  You empowered Iran to go and strengthen Hamas, strengthen Hezbollah, strengthen the Houthis [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=421.0s)]
*  to spread their terrorist activity. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=426.48s)]
*  We went and strengthened those sanctions and decimated Iran's economy. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=428.48s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  Biden has loosened the sanctions. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  Now we've got the fact that he gave $6 billion in hostage money. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  OK, now you've frozen it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=438.0s)]
*  But we have all these American hostages. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=440.04s)]
*  Guess what they're going to want? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=442.04s)]
*  If you gave them $6 billion for five people and released hostages, guess what they're [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=443.48s)]
*  going to be asking for all these others that we have? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=448.04s)]
*  So we've created this scenario where you've given Iran, the Iranian regime, too much power [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=450.84s)]
*  and too much pull and to be able to do this. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=456.2s)]
*  We've got to be strong. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=458.68s)]
*  We've got to have Israel's back. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=459.68s)]
*  And remember, as awful as these images are, and we have the back of Israel because they've [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=461.2s)]
*  been hit terribly. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=466.04s)]
*  We have to have the back of them when they hit back as well. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=467.70000000000005s)]
*  So speaking of having Israel's back, I want you to take a listen to what Donald Trump [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=470.70000000000005s)]
*  had to say about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a few days ago. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=474.64000000000004s)]
*  He has been hurt very badly because of what's happened here. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=480.26000000000005s)]
*  He was not prepared. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=484.06s)]
*  He was not prepared. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=485.62s)]
*  And Israel was not prepared. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=486.62s)]
*  And under Trump, they wouldn't have had to be prepared. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=489.1s)]
*  He went on to call Hezbollah, which the U.S. classifies as a terrorist group, very smart. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=492.5s)]
*  He called the defense minister a jerk. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=498.14s)]
*  And he went on and on. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=500.34s)]
*  This was, I think, Wednesday, so four days after the deadliest day for the Jewish people [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=501.88s)]
*  since the Holocaust. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=506.28s)]
*  What was your response when you heard that? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=507.28s)]
*  It's why I continue to say it is time for a new generational leader. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=511.09999999999997s)]
*  We've got to get past the headlines of the past. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=514.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, he congratulated the Chinese Communist Party not too long ago. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=516.9399999999999s)]
*  He's saying Hezbollah's smart. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=521.54s)]
*  I can tell you at the United Nations, when I was there and I dealt with all of them every day, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=524.18s)]
*  you don't go and compliment any of them, because what that does is that makes America look weak. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=528.18s)]
*  It doesn't make America look strong. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=535.18s)]
*  It doesn't make America have friends with them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=537.18s)]
*  What you do is you show strength. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=539.18s)]
*  You let them know what we expect of them. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=541.18s)]
*  So complimenting Hezbollah and going and complimenting the Chinese Communist Party [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=543.18s)]
*  is not just about criticizing a leader who has just watched so many of his citizens brutally murdered. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  It's the wrong place at the wrong time. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=555.0999999999999s)]
*  This isn't about Trump. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=557.0999999999999s)]
*  It's not about him. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=559.0999999999999s)]
*  It's not about what happened in the past. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=561.0999999999999s)]
*  We've got to look forward. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=563.0999999999999s)]
*  This is going to be tough days ahead for everyone involved. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=565.0999999999999s)]
*  This is not the time to sit there and bash a leader. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=567.0999999999999s)]
*  This is a time to sit there and give him the support he needs, give the Israeli people the support they need, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=569.0999999999999s)]
*  and to help us get through this in the best way possible. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  Before you go, the House still doesn't have a speaker for the first time in American history. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=579.02s)]
*  This is nearly two weeks after Kevin McCarthy was stripped of his leadership. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=582.02s)]
*  They still can't even pass a resolution condemning the Hamas attacks. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=585.02s)]
*  It's starting to look like there is not one House Republican who can get 217 votes. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=589.02s)]
*  Republican Congressman Austin Scott said the chaos, quote, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=594.02s)]
*  makes us look like a bunch of idiots, unquote. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=597.02s)]
*  Is he right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=599.02s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what's right is under the Biden administration, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=603.02s)]
*  we've seen chaos with inflation and the fact that people are hurting themselves. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  You can't blame that on Biden. You can't blame this on Biden. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=609.9399999999999s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=612.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, you have to let me finish. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=614.9399999999999s)]
*  We have seen chaos with inflation. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=616.9399999999999s)]
*  We've seen chaos with the lack of transparency in education. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=618.9399999999999s)]
*  We've seen chaos on the border. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  We've seen chaos with crime on the streets. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=622.9399999999999s)]
*  And now we're seeing chaos around the world. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=624.9399999999999s)]
*  What I am saying is you can't fix Democrat chaos with Republican chaos. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=626.9399999999999s)]
*  They need to get it together. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=630.9399999999999s)]
*  They need to get in a room and figure out who this is going to be and come out unified. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=632.9399999999999s)]
*  That's what Republicans need to do. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=636.86s)]
*  This is not a good look. This is not good for our country. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=638.86s)]
*  We saw what happened to Israel when they were distracted. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=640.86s)]
*  America looks so distracted right now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=643.86s)]
*  When America is distracted, the world is less safe. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=645.86s)]
*  We can't sit there and act like this is September 10th. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=648.86s)]
*  We better get it together and remember what it felt like September 12th. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=651.86s)]
*  Because we've got a lot of threats around us and a lot of chaos around us. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=654.86s)]
*  And we need some strength. We need some stability. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=658.86s)]
*  And again, I'll say we need a new generational leader to write this show. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=661.86s)]
*  We need a new generational leader to write this shit. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs_hCX_JmyM&t=664.86s)]
