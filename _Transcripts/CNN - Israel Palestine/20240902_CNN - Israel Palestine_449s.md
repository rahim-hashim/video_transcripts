# Gaza needs 640,000 polio vaccines. This is how the World Health Organization plans to do it
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I)
*  The United Nations-led polio vaccination campaign kicked off on Sunday, giving shots to around 87,000 children. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, the UN's Agency for Palestinian Refugees says the second phase of the campaign will be [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=8.4s)]
*  focused on the south of the Strip. All of the initial shots are scheduled to be administered by [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=14.0s)]
*  September the 12th. And remember, the promise is to immunise 640,000 kids in the enclave. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=21.04s)]
*  To give us an update on what is this enormously difficult logistical challenge, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=28.96s)]
*  Rick Peppercorn, the World Health Organisation representative for the West Bank and Gaza, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=33.84s)]
*  not just organising but actually involved in the administering of these vaccines. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=38.56s)]
*  It's good to have you, Rick. Thank you for joining us. Firstly, this vaccination drive can only happen [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=43.6s)]
*  if these temporary ceasefires hold, correct? So tell us, how's that going at present? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  Well, definitely and indeed an daunting task for all of us. Greetings from WHO in Gaza, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  which is also the Polio Emergency Operations Centre. So the task is to indeed reach 90 per cent, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=69.6s)]
*  90 per cent vaccination coverage of 640,000 children every round, for two rounds. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=77.52s)]
*  And we welcome this commitment, as you rightly said, from area-specific humanitarian policies. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  And that's why we divided Gaza in three zones. So in a central zone, in a southern zone and a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  northern zone. Each zone, we will vaccinate for three days, most likely another day, three plus [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=100.72s)]
*  one. And then we shift to the other zone. And then four weeks later, we do the same. So we [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  started yesterday with a southern zone. And the southern zone, the target population is 156,583. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=113.68s)]
*  Then we moved to the south, target population 340,000 kids and north 150. So yesterday was a good [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  day. It was actually a successful day. I was not completely surprised because in the Gaza population [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=130.0s)]
*  there's a high acceptance for vaccination. But I think they came out in their droves, families, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=137.76s)]
*  fathers, mothers, children. I visited six, seven of those centres and happy children showing their [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=143.76s)]
*  left little finger that they were vaccinated. And we vaccinated more than 86,000, almost 87,000 [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=150.64s)]
*  children in one day. This is a remarkable challenge and a remarkable feat that you've [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=160.16s)]
*  been able to get these Jebs into the arms of, or this vaccine into so many kids at this point. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=169.12s)]
*  Tell me, where were these kids coming from? Who were they coming with and what kind of state were they in? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=176.16s)]
*  Well, they're coming forever, with their fathers, with their mothers, etc. So today, for example, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=183.2s)]
*  was the second day and I went with a few mobile teams and we went and maybe you know that from the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=188.64s)]
*  television road, from the TV, there's this endless coastal roads with this endless makeshift camps [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  all over. We went all over in those camps with one of these mobile teams and everywhere, you know, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  where we met mothers and fathers with groups of children. I mean, in those camps, almost every [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  child was vaccinated. So we reached a high target and I think maybe we even underestimated the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=213.04s)]
*  target in the central zone because with the recent evacuation orders, the Gaza population is constantly [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=220.0s)]
*  in flux. But I think there is a real appetite for this vaccination. People realize why and how. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=227.04s)]
*  And again, we should not forget that Gaza always has a very high coverage in routine immunization [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  before this crisis. Coverage over 90-95%. You are absolutely relying on these temporary ceasefires [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=242.72s)]
*  holding in order to get as many of these vaccines into kids as you can. What's your message [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=254.64s)]
*  to Israel and Hamas as we speak and what are the consequences for Gaza and Israel and indeed [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=261.52s)]
*  surrounding countries if this polio outbreak is not brought under control? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=270.48s)]
*  Well, I think it's the message, of course, that we have a plan and all this is incredibly complex. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I cannot even describe to 513 teams operational, etc. And every day from six till [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=285.12s)]
*  two and all the other teams, the manages their work to midnight actually analyzes monitoring, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=292.16s)]
*  independent monitoring. I can't even describe how complex it is. I've done the things in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=297.36s)]
*  Afghanistan. This is way more complex. So the request is very clear. All these pieces of the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=301.6s)]
*  puzzle have to fit together. And the most important piece is, of course, this area specific [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=307.68s)]
*  humanitarian policies, which the parties have to stick to because otherwise, if it wouldn't happen, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=313.92s)]
*  we will not never reach this target. The children, their parents, everybody will lose their [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=321.04s)]
*  confidence with the risk that we do not stop the transmission within Gaza and indeed like the risk [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=329.04s)]
*  of polio spread out of Gaza. And with the World Health Organization, all member states, we are [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  working to eradicate polio of the world. We have only two countries where you have the wild polio [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  virus of Pakistan. You see this vaccine derived outbreaks always in areas of strife and war. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=348.56s)]
*  Children are under vaccinated. So we have to tackle this problem right on. I want to say one [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=355.44s)]
*  more point. There is a bit of a vibe, a positive vibe about this polio campaign. We only in day [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=361.12s)]
*  two, we have 10 more days to go and then four weeks later and the others, the rest of the health [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=366.24s)]
*  situation is deeply concerning. Only yesterday I had another WHO team going to the north, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=372.32s)]
*  bringing a few medical supplies and taking patients out together with PRCS from Indonesian [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=379.52s)]
*  Hospital, Kamalat 1, et cetera. This was the third mission only approved out of eight missions over [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  the last week and they came back at one o'clock in the morning, highly dangerous, highly risky [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=391.92s)]
*  and completely unnecessary. This has to improve. And my other request, of course, is for everyone, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=397.76s)]
*  this would work much better if there would be a ceasefire and we can make other arrangements. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=404.32s)]
*  I mean, this is not an ideal campaign. In an ideal situation, you want to go house to house. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=410.48s)]
*  There's very few houses left. So we make compromises but we have a war to block both. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=416.08s)]
*  Understood. Well, you've delineated very eruditely just the sort of challenges that your [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=421.36s)]
*  organization and others supporting you are facing. But the numbers at present, as you say, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=431.12s)]
*  bode well, which is a small ray of light in what has been such a dark, dark, dark 10 months. Thank [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=438.72s)]
*  you very much indeed for your own work and for joining us today. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI0wh2Gml9I&t=445.52s)]
