# Palestinian men and boys describe abuse during detention by Israeli forces
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc)
*  The breaking news, Israel accidentally killing three of its own hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=0.0s)]
*  A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces saying the three men, Yotam Chaim, Samer Talalka, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  and Alon Shemrez, either managed to escape or had been abandoned by Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=9.96s)]
*  And they likely believed they were on their way to freedom. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=15.08s)]
*  And then according to the IDF, they were confronted by Israeli forces, a moment that for them [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=18.2s)]
*  maybe they thought, oh my gosh, finally. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=21.56s)]
*  But the Israeli Defense Forces mistakenly viewed them as a threat and they shot and killed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=24.6s)]
*  them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is calling this a quote, unbearable tragedy. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=29.4s)]
*  I want to go straight to Jeremy Diamond and Jeremy, the IDF is taking full responsibility [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=33.12s)]
*  tonight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=37.92s)]
*  There's no no ambiguity about what happened here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=38.92s)]
*  What more are you learning? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=40.8s)]
*  Well, tonight, Aaron, three Israeli civilians who were being held hostage by Hamas since [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=43.4s)]
*  October 7th are dead and they were killed by Israeli forces who believe that they were [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=49.36s)]
*  militants killed mistakenly as those soldiers appeared to believe that these men were a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=54.88s)]
*  threat. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=60.24s)]
*  The three men are all in their 20s. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=61.24s)]
*  28 year old Yotam Chaim and 26 year old Alon Shemrez were both from Kibbutz Kfar Aza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=63.92s)]
*  25 year old Samer Talalka, he was kidnapped from Kibbutz near Am. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=69.68s)]
*  All of them kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=74.04s)]
*  The Israeli military says that they were either on the run or that they were abandoned by [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=77.36s)]
*  their captors. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=81.28s)]
*  It's important to note that where they were killed has been the scene of very heavy fighting [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=82.28s)]
*  over the last week. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  The Shishaiya neighborhood of Gaza City is one of Hamas's last remaining strongholds [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=88.44s)]
*  in northern Gaza and the Israeli military has been targeting them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=94.08s)]
*  Now, the Israeli prime minister for his part called this an unbearable tragedy and he said [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  that the whole state of Israel is grieving. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=101.0s)]
*  But tonight, Aaron, dozens of Israelis in Tel Aviv are also protesting, demanding that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=102.84s)]
*  the Israeli prime minister reach a deal immediately to free the 100 plus remaining hostages still [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=107.52s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=113.08s)]
*  Horrible, horrible tragedy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=114.08s)]
*  Well, the IDF, I know, also under criticism tonight for their treatment of Palestinian [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=115.08s)]
*  men and even boys who've been identified by their relatives. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  They say they're civilians. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=124.12s)]
*  These men though have been blindfolded, stripped of their clothes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=125.52s)]
*  What can you tell us about your investigation into what's happening here, Jeremy? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=128.84s)]
*  Well, Aaron, we've watched over the last week and a half as images have surfaced on social [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=134.92s)]
*  media of dozens of Palestinian men and boys stripped, blindfolded, hands handcuffed behind [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=140.2s)]
*  their backs, detained by Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  We were actually able to get firsthand testimony from about 10 of those men and boys who were [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  held by the Israeli military for five days. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Here's the abuse and the mistreatment that they described. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=157.64s)]
*  Bruised, lacerated and swollen. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=162.04s)]
*  These are the hands of Nimr Abu Ras after he was detained for five days by Israeli forces. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=164.96s)]
*  These are from the plastic wires. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  We were handcuffed behind our backs. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=173.16s)]
*  His wounds are not unique in this corner of Gaza's Al Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=175.52s)]
*  Here six boys and four men, their hands numbered with red marker, were being treated hours [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=180.72s)]
*  after Israeli forces released them without charge. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  Mahmoud is just 14 years old. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=190.64s)]
*  This is from the boots. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=194.48s)]
*  He and his father were detained by Israeli soldiers in the Al Zaytoun neighborhood of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=196.68s)]
*  Gaza City, where the Israeli military has been engaged in heavy fighting with Hamas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=201.24s)]
*  They would tie your hands behind your back and drag you like a dog. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  Plastic handcuffs scars on your arms. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Depending on the mood of one of them, they would come kick you with their boots. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=213.92s)]
*  I didn't do anything to him. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=218.48s)]
*  He just decided to come and kick me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=220.4s)]
*  Mahmoud and his father are among hundreds of Palestinian boys and men, many of them [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=224.8s)]
*  identified by their relatives or employers as civilians who have been blindfolded, stripped [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=229.56s)]
*  and detained in recent weeks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=235.0s)]
*  They put us on the floor and put their feet on our heads. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  They would ask, are you Hamas? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=241.88000000000002s)]
*  And beat us. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=244.0s)]
*  When we wanted to sleep, we couldn't because it was so cold. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=245.24s)]
*  And when we asked for something to wear or cover ourselves with, they would beat us. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=248.44s)]
*  The 10 boys and men who spoke to CNN described nearly identical accounts of abuse. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=254.64s)]
*  Several said they were not allowed to go to the bathroom, made to sleep on grains of rice [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=261.12s)]
*  spread on the floor and given little to no food or water. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=265.6s)]
*  A day after he arrived at the hospital, 40-year-old Mahmoud Isleem can barely stand. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=271.48s)]
*  His relatives say he is diabetic and had no access to insulin during his five-day detention. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=279.08s)]
*  All arrived physically and psychologically exhausted. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=285.8s)]
*  There were signs of torture on their arms and signs of beating all over their bodies. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=288.84s)]
*  In a statement, the Israeli military said it was detaining individuals suspected of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=295.32s)]
*  involvement in terrorist activity and that those who are found not to be taking part [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=299.8s)]
*  in terrorist activities are released. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=304.28s)]
*  The IDF said the individuals detained are treated in accordance with international law [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=306.68s)]
*  and that it strives to treat any detainee with dignity. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=311.8s)]
*  Any incident in which the guidelines were not followed will be looked into. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=315.8s)]
*  A spokesman for the Israeli military declined to address specific allegations of mistreatment [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  or provide an explanation for the detention of the 10 boys and men interviewed by CNN. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=326.24s)]
*  International law is quite clear that you can only detain civilians when absolutely necessary [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=332.12s)]
*  for imperative reasons of security. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=338.68s)]
*  Whether the detention is of a civilian or a combatant, the law protects those in detention [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=341.4s)]
*  and custody against degrading and humiliating treatment and outrages upon personal dignity. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=347.16s)]
*  For 14-year-old Ahmed, the trauma is not just physical. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=353.32s)]
*  I don't want to speak. I'm afraid. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=357.16s)]
*  I'm scared of the Israelis. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=360.36s)]
*  I don't want them to do something to us. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=361.8s)]
*  With his father's permission, he adds his story to the allegations of abuse. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=364.36s)]
*  And now the State Department has said that Israeli officials have committed to returning [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=373.56s)]
*  the clothing to these detainees as soon as they are strip searched, but so many more questions [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=378.04s)]
*  still remain, Aaron, about the practice of detaining these large groups of men and boys [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=383.32s)]
*  in areas of Gaza and also their treatment as we heard from them firsthand. Aaron? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=387.64s)]
*  Absolutely. I used to hear from so many young men and teens at Palestinians in the West Bank [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=393.24s)]
*  as well, these frustrations. All right. Thank you very much, Jeremy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=399.8s)]
*  And I want to go now to Israeli-American Jonathan Dekelchen. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=402.76s)]
*  His son, 35-year-old Saghi Dekelchen, is still being held in Gaza. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=406.12s)]
*  Saghi is the father of two young children. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=411.08s)]
*  Jonathan, I know you wait and wait, and every day is that agonizing wait. And then today, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=413.64s)]
*  the IDF says that three Israeli hostages in Gaza were killed mistakenly by IDF forces, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=420.68s)]
*  that it appears that they'd either tried to escape or been abandoned by Hamas, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=427.4s)]
*  but there they were, and they see the IDF, and surely they think that this is it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=431.32s)]
*  And then this horrific, horrific thing happens. I can't even imagine for you [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=436.92s)]
*  what your reaction could be when you heard this today and how terrified you must be that this [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=441.56s)]
*  could happen to your son if he tried to escape or something. Well, that is certainly a thought that [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=445.32s)]
*  goes through my head, and surely every other person who has a loved one in Hamas' captivity. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=452.84s)]
*  As far as this tragic, tragic incident today, it's tragedy upon tragedy. These three young men [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=461.72s)]
*  probably did think that they were on their way to freedom after 70 or so days of a living hell, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=469.47999999999996s)]
*  and having somehow survived the massacre on October 7th. It's also tragic because [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=476.67999999999995s)]
*  their families now will never see them again. They are victims of, delayed, but victims of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=482.84s)]
*  October 7th as well. And as an ex-soldier, as any old soldier would be able to say, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  I feel terrible for the soldiers themselves, the Israeli soldiers who clearly made a fatal error, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=497.64s)]
*  and they're going to have to live with that for the rest of their lives. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=503.8s)]
*  It is just so horrible. I know you had a chance, Jonathan, to meet with President Biden at the [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=507.96s)]
*  White House this week. We've got some images of that, and I know that much of that conversation, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=512.84s)]
*  of course, was private. It was you and other Americans, Israeli Americans, who have family [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=518.68s)]
*  members who are held hostage by Hamas right now. But what can you share about that meeting? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=524.2s)]
*  Well, it was indeed a meeting. There were representatives from nine, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=531.08s)]
*  actually 10, of the American families who had, or most of them still have, hostages being held by [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=535.08s)]
*  Hamas. We indeed met with President Biden and Secretary Blinken for about two hours in the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=542.6s)]
*  White House, and it was really a reassuring experience. And we went into it having really [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8hM29eU2Gc&t=549.48s)]
