# Retired IDF general criticizes Israeli military: We failed to defend civilians
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348)
*  The tension at the border of Israel and Gaza is palpable tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=0.0s)]
*  You can hear where Nick Robertson is. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=3.84s)]
*  You can even hear the thuds of the explosions in Gaza from here in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  It comes as we are learning tonight about the incredible bravery of a retired Israeli [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=9.42s)]
*  general who headed straight into Nahal Ouz Kibbutz, which is just a few miles from Gaza, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=13.14s)]
*  as it was under attack on Saturday morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=18.72s)]
*  And along the way, General Ziv, armed only with a pistol, encountered Israeli soldiers [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  who were outmanned and outgunned. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=26.060000000000002s)]
*  And I spoke with him. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=28.64s)]
*  He was deeply emotional as he told me about the horrors he witnessed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=29.88s)]
*  General, that morning, Saturday morning, you... [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=35.6s)]
*  Was this the gun? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=41.64s)]
*  What gun did you have? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  This is new. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  This is new. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=45.84s)]
*  The gun that I had was a little bit more simpler. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=46.84s)]
*  This one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  That was your pistol. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=54.0s)]
*  So you were about to go for a bike ride. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=54.8s)]
*  Correct. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=56.64s)]
*  Take your pistol with you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=57.64s)]
*  No. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=58.64s)]
*  I live next to Kfar Saba. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=59.64s)]
*  It's like an hour and a half from here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=62.64s)]
*  I was biking my bike at six o'clock, like every Saturday. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=65.64s)]
*  And we had the alert. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=70.64s)]
*  And I thought it might be some racket or something simple that we already know. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=73.64s)]
*  And then I had the call that something very serious and very heavy is happening. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=81.64s)]
*  So I took that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=86.64s)]
*  The uniform that are waiting for such occasion in the cabinet. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=87.64s)]
*  And took my car and ran to Gaza to engage, to meet the forces. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=91.64s)]
*  So then what did you do? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=99.64s)]
*  We had very few forces, very few units. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=103.64s)]
*  So I engaged with the units and we went to a place to a place to see what's going on. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=107.64s)]
*  Along the way we had a lot of engagements. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=111.64s)]
*  There were huge amounts with the Hamas, yes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=114.64s)]
*  A lot of close contact engagements. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=117.64s)]
*  So I was with the soldiers. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=121.64s)]
*  I was shooting with that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=123.64s)]
*  When a soldier was injured next to me, I took his gun and shot. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=124.64s)]
*  And we progressed from place to place all day long until that night. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=131.64s)]
*  And then later on that evening, Saturday night, more units came in. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=135.64s)]
*  So I had to engage them into the situation and help them to manage with the battle in some of the kibbutzim. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=141.64s)]
*  And General, what did you see? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=148.64s)]
*  What did you see them doing in this kibbutzim? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=150.64s)]
*  No, it's terrible. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=153.64s)]
*  In my whole military career, I haven't seen such horrifying and terrible things of killing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=154.64s)]
*  I saw women holding their children and being shot by holding them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=162.64s)]
*  People were hiding under furniture and got murdered. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=167.64s)]
*  I saw a few people that their heads were trapped. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=172.64s)]
*  Children. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=175.64s)]
*  So it was terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=183.64s)]
*  And we failed, we failed. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=187.64s)]
*  I feel ashamed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=188.64s)]
*  We failed to protect them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=189.64s)]
*  They live here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=191.64s)]
*  They are the first line of all Israel, of our sovereignty. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=192.64s)]
*  And we failed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=196.64s)]
*  We failed to defend them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=197.64s)]
*  It's a personal humiliation and national humiliation at the same time. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=201.64s)]
*  General, it is hard for anyone to hear what you're saying. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=208.64s)]
*  To imagine that you saw, you had to see a mother holding a child, shot. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=211.64s)]
*  People were hiding under furniture. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=216.64s)]
*  Can you even unsee such things? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=218.64s)]
*  Could you even comprehend, as you saw, it happened that it was a human being. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=220.64s)]
*  Doing these things to another human being. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=226.64s)]
*  Nothing of that is human. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=228.64s)]
*  It's animals. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=230.64s)]
*  Only animals can do such a thing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=231.64s)]
*  I've never seen such a thing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=233.64s)]
*  This is really low, as only animals can do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=235.64s)]
*  It's only animals can do. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=240.64s)]
*  There's nothing human that you can see in their act. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=242.64s)]
*  You know, it's burning. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=246.64s)]
*  Burning people. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=249.64s)]
*  I went that afternoon and later to the party, to the festival. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=250.64s)]
*  Hundreds of people, kids, 16, 17, 18, are massacred, are dead. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=257.64s)]
*  And you saw, because I know when you kill somebody from close contact, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=264.64s)]
*  and some of them try to escape. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=269.64s)]
*  So they were waiting for them to get to the car, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=271.64s)]
*  and they start to shoot them when they are in the car, they are trapped. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=274.64s)]
*  And you saw, you know, just overwhelmed the amount of bullets. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=278.64s)]
*  And later on they tried to burn the car with the bodies. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=285.64s)]
*  Animals. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=292.64s)]
*  Real animals. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=293.64s)]
*  And we cannot have them as a neighbor. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=295.64s)]
*  I mean, if they act as a jungle law, we have to act also, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=297.64s)]
*  because we are in the same jungle, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=304.64s)]
*  and we cannot have that jungle in our own homes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=306.64s)]
*  How many Hamas fighters did you see? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=311.64s)]
*  How many did you see? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=314.64s)]
*  Myself, in my own eyes, dozens of them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=316.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=320.64s)]
*  But I think there were much above 1,500 Hamas. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=321.64s)]
*  I mean, I didn't know that by then. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=327.64s)]
*  But what we have learned later is that there were at least 1,500 people [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=329.64s)]
*  or more. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=335.64s)]
*  Some of them, you know, are more commando type, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=336.64s)]
*  the first line of terrorists. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=340.64s)]
*  Some of them are second echelon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=343.64s)]
*  And even civilians, they call civilians to take gun, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=346.64s)]
*  to come over to the kibbutzim and, you know, rob and rape [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=349.64s)]
*  and do whatever they want. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=353.64s)]
*  And we killed many, many of those. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=355.64s)]
*  By the way, all of them came with weapons. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=358.64s)]
*  General, thank you very much. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=360.64s)]
*  Thank you very much for asking and being here with us. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=362.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=366.64s)]
*  General Ziv did not hold back on criticizing his own government [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=370.64s)]
*  and his own military. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=374.64s)]
*  He called what happened Saturday a complete failure. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=376.64s)]
*  It's a total collapse. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=381.64s)]
*  I'm not going to say any excuses. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=382.64s)]
*  It's a total collapse. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=385.64s)]
*  It's a systematic collapse. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=387.64s)]
*  It's the intelligence, it's the whole defense system. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=390.64s)]
*  The defense system has a lot of elements, you know. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=394.64s)]
*  It's defense, it's the technology, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=398.64s)]
*  it's the deployment of the army, it's the backup, so many things. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=401.64s)]
*  It all collapsed. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=406.64s)]
*  So we cannot, you know, saying that any excuses is not acceptable. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=408.64s)]
*  We have to inquire that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=415.64s)]
*  We have to investigate it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=417.64s)]
*  We have to learn very serious lessons. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=418.64s)]
*  By the way, in none of the scenarios, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=420.64s)]
*  we had an idea that the Hamas from a terror organization [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=424.64s)]
*  will act as an army. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=429.64s)]
*  What we think today is that Iran is behind it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=432.64s)]
*  Their plan is a copy paste of the Hezbollah. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=436.64s)]
*  They have a similar plan in the north, you know, take over the center. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=440.64s)]
*  Exactly the same thing that we have seen here. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=444.64s)]
*  But then again, we should have guess or learn [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=447.64s)]
*  or take under a serious assumption that such thing could have happened. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=452.64s)]
*  And we didn't. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=457.64s)]
*  Well, the security lapse prior to Hamas' assault over the weekend [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=458.64s)]
*  has many wondering what will be done to make sure it never happens again. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=461.64s)]
*  Joining us now is former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=464.64s)]
*  Sir, we appreciate your time this morning. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=467.64s)]
*  We want to look forward and kind of what to expect, what you're seeing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=469.64s)]
*  But to start there, I think it's been striking [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=472.64s)]
*  when you listen to Israeli officials, IDF officials, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=475.64s)]
*  as they try and figure out what happened, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=478.64s)]
*  including this from a retired general to our colleague last night. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=480.64s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=483.64s)]
*  We fail, we fail. I feel ashamed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=485.64s)]
*  We fail to protect them. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=488.64s)]
*  They live here. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=490.64s)]
*  They are the first line of all Israel, of our sovereignty. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=491.64s)]
*  And we fail. We fail to defend them. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=495.64s)]
*  It's a personal humiliation and national humiliation, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=499.64s)]
*  humiliation at the same time. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=503.64s)]
*  And sir, I think what stuck out to me, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=506.64s)]
*  you had an interview with Channel 11 News [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=508.64s)]
*  where you were talking about how the international community views Israel right now. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=510.64s)]
*  You said, I don't want their pity. I want them to fear us. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=513.64s)]
*  I want them to understand our strength. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=515.64s)]
*  Are you concerned that kind of how Israel is perceived [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=517.64s)]
*  has been punctured over the course of the last six days? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=522.64s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. And whoever that general is, is correct. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=525.64s)]
*  There's no doubt that the first and foremost duty of a sovereign state [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=531.64s)]
*  is to protect its citizens. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=536.64s)]
*  And factually, 1,500 Israeli citizens were slaughtered by Nazi monsters. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=538.64s)]
*  And we're going to have to fix all of this. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=547.64s)]
*  Okay, military history teaches us that time and again, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=551.64s)]
*  there's a limit to our mistakes like Pearl Harbor, like Barbarossa, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=555.64s)]
*  like 9-11, like the Yom Kippur War. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=563.64s)]
*  We're going to have to fix it. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=566.64s)]
*  But now our view is forward and going to the next stage [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=568.64s)]
*  from collecting ourselves and kicking out and killing all the terrorists [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=572.64s)]
*  that entered Israel to the next stage, which is the offensive stage. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2S4Vi4F348&t=578.64s)]
