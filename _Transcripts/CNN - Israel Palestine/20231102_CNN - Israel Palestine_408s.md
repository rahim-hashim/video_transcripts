# Rabbi confronts President Biden
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg)
*  Hundreds of Americans could be leaving Gaza today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=0.0s)]
*  According to this new deal with Hamas, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=3.88s)]
*  they have been trapped inside the war zone for weeks. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=5.92s)]
*  As Israel continues its unrelenting air and ground [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=8.96s)]
*  assault on Gaza, you are looking at the devastation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=11.84s)]
*  from a second airstrike in two days on Gaza's largest refugee [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=15.32s)]
*  camp. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=19.68s)]
*  The IDF says it was targeting Hamas's command center there, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=20.72s)]
*  but the United Nations Human Rights Office [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=24.32s)]
*  is now warning the high number of civilian casualties [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=26.72s)]
*  from the strikes on the densely populated Jabalah camp [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=29.56s)]
*  put them out to a war crime. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=32.76s)]
*  On the ground, the Israeli military [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=34.16s)]
*  says Hamas's defensive lines are collapsing, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=35.68s)]
*  and militants are retreating into central Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=38.16s)]
*  This is the latest video from the IDF of Israeli tanks [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  and soldiers advancing as bombs rain down. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=43.96s)]
*  President Biden is now saying he supports a humanitarian pause [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=46.76s)]
*  in the war to save hostages who are still in Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=50.04s)]
*  Those hostages, of course, include Americans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=52.76s)]
*  At a campaign fundraiser last night, a protester, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=55.2s)]
*  see some of it here, interrupted the president [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  calling for a ceasefire. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=59.92s)]
*  According to the reporters in the room, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=61.48s)]
*  he responded, quote, I think we need a pause. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=63.04s)]
*  A pause means give time to get the prisoners out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=65.44s)]
*  We have live coverage all morning. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=68.32s)]
*  Priscilla Alvarez is live for us at the White House. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=70.0s)]
*  Let's start with Rafael Romo in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=72.32s)]
*  Rafael, I want to start with the Ra'afah border crossing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=74.56s)]
*  There's the expectation with US officials [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=77.0s)]
*  that more Americans will be getting out today. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=79.08s)]
*  What's the latest in terms of people [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=81.2s)]
*  getting across that border? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=82.84s)]
*  Hi, Phil, Poppy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=84.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=84.96s)]
*  The expectation is that more Americans, indeed, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=85.48s)]
*  and more foreigners in general will [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=87.96s)]
*  be able to pass through a US State Department spokesman. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=90.32s)]
*  Confirmed Wednesday that an initial group [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=93.88s)]
*  of foreign nationals, including US citizens, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=97.48s)]
*  had departed Gaza and had made it into Egypt, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=100.0s)]
*  although he declined to give specifics [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  on the numbers of US citizens who [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=105.48s)]
*  were able to leave Gaza, citing operational security [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=107.28s)]
*  concerns. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=111.2s)]
*  He did say, though, that more Americans would be able to leave [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=111.72s)]
*  today and in the next days, and that the State Department had [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=115.36s)]
*  communicated directly with American citizens in Gaza [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=118.88s)]
*  so that they would be ready to go. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=122.04s)]
*  There was also confirmation from President Biden himself. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=124.92s)]
*  He wrote Wednesday on X that the US [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=128.6s)]
*  had secured a safe passage for wounded Palestinians [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=131.36s)]
*  and for foreign nationals to exit Gaza, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=135.24s)]
*  and were expected to leave Gaza. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=137.6s)]
*  And we're expecting some American citizens [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=139.56s)]
*  to exit right away with more departing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=142.04s)]
*  over the next coming days. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=145.4s)]
*  How many Americans were stuck in Gaza, you may ask? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=146.68s)]
*  Well, at a Senate Appropriations Committee, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=150.28s)]
*  hearing Secretary of State Blinken [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=152.96s)]
*  said there were approximately 400 plus their families, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=154.96s)]
*  about 1,000 people in total. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=159.28s)]
*  He also said that there are about 5,000 other third country [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=161.28s)]
*  nationals in Gaza who want to get out as well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=166.12s)]
*  Poppy, Phil? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=169.68s)]
*  There has been a second strike, Rafael, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=171.16s)]
*  since yesterday morning, since we were on with you last, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=173.88s)]
*  on that refugee camp by Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  How are they explaining it? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=179.68s)]
*  How are they defending it, given they [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=180.88s)]
*  said the first strike took out the Hamas [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=182.24s)]
*  target they were going after? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=185.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  So an Israel Defense Forces commander [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=190.96s)]
*  last night say that the problem here [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=195.08s)]
*  is what they've been facing all along. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  The problem is that Hamas is embedded [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=200.68s)]
*  in civilian communities, building their command centers, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  their infrastructure behind schools, hospitals, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  and other civic centers. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=211.12s)]
*  And it is very difficult to be able to target [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=212.52s)]
*  the commanders and the operatives [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  without any casualties. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  He said that they're trying their best not to go, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=222.4s)]
*  not to harm any civilians, that they do not [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=226.28s)]
*  intend to injure any civilians. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=229.0s)]
*  But it is a reality that they're facing in the ground. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  They also reiterated what they said a couple of weeks ago, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=235.68s)]
*  that they had asked the civilian population [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=238.84s)]
*  to leave those combat zones in the north and go south. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=241.12s)]
*  But again, what we're hearing from relief workers and doctors [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=245.88s)]
*  in the north is that many of these people cannot leave. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=250.2s)]
*  Many of them are sick, are being treated in hospitals. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=253.88s)]
*  We are talking about families with young children. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=257.4s)]
*  It is just impossible for them to get through. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=259.6s)]
*  And then again, there is really no safe place in Gaza [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=261.8s)]
*  at this point, Poppy and Phil. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=265.8s)]
*  Rafael Bromo, thank you for the reporting. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=267.6s)]
*  Let's go down to Priscilla Alvarez at the White House. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=269.64s)]
*  Priscilla, let's show that video from the moment [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  at this fundraiser last night in Minnesota [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  when a protester who identified herself as Rabbi Jessica [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=275.88s)]
*  Rosenberg interrupted President Biden [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=278.28s)]
*  and called for a ceasefire. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=280.23999999999995s)]
*  Watch. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=281.52s)]
*  Mr. President, if you care about Jewish people as a rabbi, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=284.23999999999995s)]
*  I need you to call for a ceasefire right now. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  No. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=290.73999999999995s)]
*  No. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=291.23999999999995s)]
*  No. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=291.73999999999995s)]
*  No. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  Get out! [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=292.73999999999995s)]
*  Get out! [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  Get out! [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=293.73999999999995s)]
*  Get out! [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=294.23999999999995s)]
*  Now, what's interesting is the president, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=296.23999999999995s)]
*  even though she was being shushed and told to leave, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  he did actually stand and answer a couple of her questions. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=300.0s)]
*  The president said he understood the emotion. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=302.76s)]
*  He called for a humanitarian pause. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=304.67999999999995s)]
*  Priscilla, he was careful not to say ceasefire. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  When you look at what he said, what does he mean here? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=309.08s)]
*  Well, in this moment, really captured the delicate nature [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=312.8s)]
*  of the conflict and the heightened emotions [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=315.28s)]
*  that this White House is trying to navigate. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=317.4s)]
*  So the president did acknowledge the protesters' remarks [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=319.71999999999997s)]
*  there about a ceasefire, saying, quote, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=322.52s)]
*  I think we need a pause. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=324.47999999999996s)]
*  A pause means give time to get the prisoners out. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=326.28s)]
*  That referring to the hostages held by Hamas. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=329.52s)]
*  So the president is really extending [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=332.64s)]
*  what US officials have already said, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=335.36s)]
*  which is that they would like to see Israel engage [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=337.2s)]
*  in a humanitarian pause to get aid into Gaza [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=341.16s)]
*  and also to get these hostages out of Gaza. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  But they have always been very, very careful [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=346.88s)]
*  about using the term ceasefire, saying ceasefire, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=349.88s)]
*  and even implying it all, that they are telling Israel [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=352.36s)]
*  what to do and how to conduct its military operation. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=356.0s)]
*  So what President Biden said last night [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  was really an extension of what we have been hearing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  from US officials, but again, it underscores [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=364.04s)]
*  how politically difficult this is for the president, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=366.8s)]
*  that happening at a campaign fundraiser in Minneapolis. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=369.48s)]
*  And also the president reminding the crowd [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=373.16s)]
*  that this is a complicated conflict, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=376.4s)]
*  that Hamas is a terrorist organization, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=378.16s)]
*  and also noting that he is the guy that got aid into Gaza. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=380.92s)]
*  So making quite a few points there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=385.28s)]
*  One, that this is all very fast developing and ongoing, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=387.16s)]
*  but also that he is the person to talk to these leaders [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=389.52s)]
*  and try to arrange for aid to get into Gaza [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=393.44s)]
*  and also work to get those hostages out of Gaza. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  But again, Phil, all of this just underscoring again [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=398.4s)]
*  how complicated and difficult it is [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  as this White House proceeds. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=403.23999999999995s)]
*  Priscilla Alvarez, thank you very much for the reporting. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1itbVmX50Xg&t=405.23999999999995s)]
