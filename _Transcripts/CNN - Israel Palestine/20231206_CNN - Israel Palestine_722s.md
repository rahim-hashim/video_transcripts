# Blinken describes how the Israel-Hamas war affects him personally
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI)
*  We talked to Secretary Blinken to talk about his efforts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=0.0s)]
*  to mediate the war between Israel and Hamas, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=2.48s)]
*  how it's affecting him personally and it has, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=4.96s)]
*  his guiding mantra, he told us that, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=7.24s)]
*  and the ongoing struggle to reunite hostages [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=9.72s)]
*  with their families, and that's where we began [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=12.56s)]
*  the conversation. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=15.0s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=17.68s)]
*  We're very glad that you're on the program tonight. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=19.32s)]
*  We've been looking forward to this conversation, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=21.72s)]
*  haven't we, Charles? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=23.44s)]
*  This is pretty special. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=24.28s)]
*  Yeah, we think it's very special. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=25.12s)]
*  Great to be with both of you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=26.96s)]
*  Gail, Charles, thanks for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=28.04s)]
*  Yes, we feel that too. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=29.32s)]
*  Let's talk about the hostages if we could. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=31.48s)]
*  The talks have broken down, the war has resumed, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=33.72s)]
*  and of course, everybody's concern worldwide [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=35.92s)]
*  is about the fate of the hostages. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=38.68s)]
*  I realize it's all hands on deck, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=40.28s)]
*  all countries are working to secure their hostages [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=42.92s)]
*  to get them home safely, to get all the hostages home, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=45.32s)]
*  but I'm wondering, is the Biden administration [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  doing anything specifically to get the release [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=50.36s)]
*  of the American hostages, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  realizing we want all the hostages home? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, Gail, we're at this every single day, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=57.6s)]
*  and it's my number one responsibility, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=60.92s)]
*  I know the president feels this, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=63.92s)]
*  his number one responsibility, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=65.24s)]
*  to look out for any American who's in harm's way abroad, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=67.22s)]
*  and especially those who are being held hostage, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=70.64s)]
*  being held captive in some way. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=73.4s)]
*  I've met with the families, I've heard directly from them, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=75.4s)]
*  and that's the thing that motivates me the most. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=79.68s)]
*  We will not rest until we get every single one. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=82.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's not enough, all the families. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=85.0s)]
*  I always say this, Mr. Secretary, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=86.3s)]
*  that for all these hostages, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=87.94s)]
*  there are numbers for some people, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=89.7s)]
*  but the family members, they are somebody's everything. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=90.97999999999999s)]
*  So can you share with us, if you can, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=94.3s)]
*  specifically what you guys are doing? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=96.3s)]
*  Look, you'll understand, I can't get into the details, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  because this is literally going on daily [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=102.14s)]
*  and even more than daily, sometimes even hourly, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=104.97999999999999s)]
*  trying to find a way, an angle to get this restarted. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=107.74s)]
*  And you're exactly right, these are not, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=112.2s)]
*  it's not a question of numbers. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=114.58s)]
*  These are real people, real lives, real families, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  whose lives have been torn upside down. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=120.74s)]
*  I've got photographs of all of them. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=125.06s)]
*  It's real for me, it's real for the president, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=127.38s)]
*  and we're on this, unfortunately. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=130.46s)]
*  Hamas gets the vote, and Hamas stopped releasing hostages. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=133.54s)]
*  It reneged on its commitments to Israel [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=139.74s)]
*  and to everyone else concerned. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=142.62s)]
*  They chose to end this process of releasing hostages. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=144.86s)]
*  They need to choose to start it again. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=148.06s)]
*  You know, you asked Israel to take precautions [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=150.26s)]
*  as far as civilians in Gaza. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=153.18s)]
*  Is that actually possible? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  Charles, I think it's important to do two things. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=159.94s)]
*  First, we gotta put this in perspective. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=163.4s)]
*  What happened on October 7th is something I've never seen [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=166.84s)]
*  in the 30 years that I've been doing this professionally, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=170.54s)]
*  and for that matter of the 50 years or so [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=173.42s)]
*  that I've been going to Israel in one way or another. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=175.9s)]
*  Children executed in front of their parents. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=179.82s)]
*  Parents executed in front of their children. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=182.62s)]
*  Families burned alive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=185.29999999999998s)]
*  You heard yesterday about the horrific sexual violence, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  the rapes of so many young women. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=191.16s)]
*  What was done deliberately, intentionally, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=194.14s)]
*  with the brutality that really I've encountered [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=196.18s)]
*  almost nowhere else in the many years [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=198.58s)]
*  that I've been doing this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=200.62s)]
*  So, and then you have this terrorist group, Hamas, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  do that, retreat to Gaza, and intentionally embed itself [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=206.9s)]
*  with civilians, with innocent men, women, and children [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  in and under apartment buildings, in and under hospitals, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  in and under mosques, in and under schools. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=217.9s)]
*  So, it's very, very challenging for Israel [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=220.66000000000003s)]
*  to do what it needs to do to try to make sure [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=224.54000000000002s)]
*  that this never happens again, and getting at Hamas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=226.58s)]
*  But having said that, and as we said from day one, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  they nonetheless have an obligation [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  to do everything possible to protect civilians, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  to distinguish between terrorists [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=237.4s)]
*  and innocent men, women, and children. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=239.68s)]
*  And this is something that we've been on. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=241.74s)]
*  And that part doesn't seem to be going so well, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=242.58s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, about keeping the civilians safe, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=244.06s)]
*  because the civilians are dying, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=247.86s)]
*  including thousands of children, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=249.38000000000002s)]
*  and I think that's what's so heartbreaking [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=251.02s)]
*  for everybody around the world. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=252.44s)]
*  What happens- It's gut wrenching. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=254.08s)]
*  It's gut wrenching for all of us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=255.62s)]
*  But what we're seeing now is we're seeing some, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=257.58s)]
*  I think, important steps being taken [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=260.86s)]
*  as they're beginning to operate in the south of Gaza, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=263.12s)]
*  after operations in the north. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=266.42s)]
*  And in the south, what we're seeing, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=269.26s)]
*  and I said to them very clearly [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=270.62s)]
*  when I was there just a week ago, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  we cannot have a repeat of what happened [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  in the north and the south, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=275.03999999999996s)]
*  in terms of harm being done to civilians, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=276.24s)]
*  and also making sure that humanitarian assistance [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=279.86s)]
*  is getting to people who need it, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=282.46s)]
*  who are in desperate need of food, of water, of shelter. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=283.86s)]
*  So what we're seeing is areas clearly designated by Israel [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  that are safe areas where there's not going to be firing, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=291.3s)]
*  or the military, we've seen efforts [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=294.9s)]
*  to make sure that people know that they need to move, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=297.74s)]
*  and not the entire city, but just discrete neighborhoods. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=300.74s)]
*  So that's positive. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=304.86s)]
*  On the other hand, there's more that has to happen [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=306.74s)]
*  that needs to be done, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=309.74s)]
*  making sure that people have safe corridors [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=310.56s)]
*  in order to get from areas that could be in danger [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=312.88s)]
*  to places where they'll be safe. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  Making sure that those areas where they're going to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=316.52s)]
*  have the proper resources, have the food, have the water, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=318.8s)]
*  have the medicine to care for them [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=321.8s)]
*  while they're in those areas. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=323.18s)]
*  So there are a number of things that need to happen. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=324.52s)]
*  We're on this with them every single day. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=326.96s)]
*  My son-in-law is an amazing man and a great husband. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=329.6s)]
*  He's also Jewish, and you're Jewish. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=334.2s)]
*  He's taken this Israel thing very personally, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=337.76s)]
*  how are you feeling? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=343.44s)]
*  How does it affect you? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=345.86s)]
*  Because he's struggling. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=347.0s)]
*  How do you as a Jewish man, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=348.52s)]
*  how are you handling the entire situation mentally? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=350.36s)]
*  And the stepson of a Holocaust survivor too, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=354.08s)]
*  which I think adds another layer of pain [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=356.6s)]
*  in this particular story. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=359.8s)]
*  Well, of course it's affected me personally, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=362.32s)]
*  and I've talked about that a little bit. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=365.12s)]
*  It's affected me personally because yes, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=368.36s)]
*  my late stepfather survived the Holocaust. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=370.84s)]
*  He was in the concentration camps [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=373.44s)]
*  in Maidanek and Dachau and Auschwitz. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=374.88s)]
*  And then my father's father in a different generation, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=377.78s)]
*  the turn of the last century, got chased out of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  actually what's now Ukraine by pogroms [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=385.28s)]
*  that were designed to kill or chase Jews away. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=388.4s)]
*  So when I saw what happened on October 7th, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=392.08s)]
*  of course it had a personal resonance. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=394.84s)]
*  It had a resonance that goes to the history [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=398.56s)]
*  of the Jewish people, especially by the nature, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=401.52s)]
*  the savagery of the attacks that were committed. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=403.88s)]
*  But having said that, I'm an American. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=406.88s)]
*  I have the awesome responsibility and privilege [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=412.0s)]
*  of being Secretary of State and representing [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=414.26s)]
*  all of the American people around the world [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=416.64s)]
*  on behalf of the President. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  And as I'm doing my job to the best of my ability, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm trying to make sure that I'm reflecting [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  America's interests, America's values, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=427.28s)]
*  and doing what's right for our country. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=429.85999999999996s)]
*  How safe, how safe, two questions, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=432.05999999999995s)]
*  how safe are Jewish students in college? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=435.08s)]
*  And where is the line between hate speech [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=438.97999999999996s)]
*  and freedom of speech? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=443.2s)]
*  Charles, we're seeing this every day [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  play out on our campuses. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=447.79999999999995s)]
*  And while I'm focused on the world beyond our borders, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=448.88s)]
*  like anyone else, I'm reading, hearing about [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=452.52s)]
*  what's happening on some campuses, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=455.4s)]
*  talking to my own relatives who have kids [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=458.24s)]
*  who are college age who've been on the receiving end [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=460.08s)]
*  of this, and it's deeply, deeply disturbing [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=462.68s)]
*  and more to see some of the hate that we're hearing [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  on college campuses, the expressions of vitriol, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  the intimidation of students just for being who they are. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=477.36s)]
*  And that's something that is not entirely new, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=481.92s)]
*  but it's sort of come out from beneath the rock [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=486.8s)]
*  since October 7th. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  And by the way, I'm also deeply disturbed [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  about the same kind of hatred and vitriol [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=494.44s)]
*  being directed against Muslim Americans, Arab Americans. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=496.68s)]
*  We see this in all different directions. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=502.32s)]
*  And we have to get back to a place [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  where people on all of our campuses [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=508.92s)]
*  can feel safe being who they are, what they are, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=511.94s)]
*  and saying what they believe. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=516.6400000000001s)]
*  You know, I think you raise a really good point [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=518.2s)]
*  about feeling safe and being able to speak [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=520.9200000000001s)]
*  because I know so many people are struggling [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  with even how to have a conversation [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=525.0400000000001s)]
*  about this, Mr. Secretary, no matter what you say, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=529.0s)]
*  no matter what you say or how you say it, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=532.08s)]
*  you are immediately slammed by somebody. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=534.4000000000001s)]
*  How can we have this conversation intelligently [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  and respectfully with all these different points of view? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=540.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, my humble opinion is this. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=544.8s)]
*  Here's where it starts. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=548.1999999999999s)]
*  It starts with stopping something. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  And what we need to stop is the dehumanization of the other. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=551.24s)]
*  We have to recognize the humanity in each other. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=555.88s)]
*  We have to try to put ourselves in other people's shoes. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=558.6999999999999s)]
*  We have to have that openness of mind and openness of heart. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=562.3599999999999s)]
*  And when you have that, you can talk about anything, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=566.3399999999999s)]
*  even the hardest things. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=570.76s)]
*  But once you start dehumanizing, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=572.08s)]
*  once you start seeing someone as another [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=575.5600000000001s)]
*  and somehow not human, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=579.8000000000001s)]
*  that takes every guardrail, every check away. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=582.96s)]
*  And then it's open season. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=588.0400000000001s)]
*  I always say that it's very hard to hate up close. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=589.88s)]
*  You know, just having... [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=593.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=594.08s)]
*  I always say that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=594.9000000000001s)]
*  What part do our politicians have they played? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=596.22s)]
*  Because clearly, if you watch television every day, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=601.74s)]
*  the Democrats and Republicans, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=604.82s)]
*  they're not civil to each other. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=606.98s)]
*  What part do you think they played [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=609.46s)]
*  in us losing our civility? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=612.14s)]
*  Well, one of the great things about this job [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=615.98s)]
*  being Secretary of State is I don't do politics. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=617.84s)]
*  And I don't want to start, but you know... [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=620.62s)]
*  What do you mean you don't? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=622.94s)]
*  Wait a second, wait a second, Mr. Secretary. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=623.78s)]
*  Your whole job is politics. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=625.9s)]
*  What do you mean you don't do politics? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=627.4200000000001s)]
*  You have to explain. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=629.3000000000001s)]
*  Around the world, but not here at home. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=631.98s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=633.7s)]
*  What I've heard President Biden say for years, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=634.86s)]
*  because I've had the immense privilege [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=637.46s)]
*  of working for him for more than 20 years. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=638.98s)]
*  And you know, he's constantly said over these years, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=642.38s)]
*  it's totally appropriate [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=645.5s)]
*  to be questioning each other's judgments, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=646.78s)]
*  but let's stop questioning each other's motives. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=648.48s)]
*  Let's assume good motives, good intentions, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=651.88s)]
*  and then we can really have a conversation [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=654.94s)]
*  and we can really try to get to someplace better. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=657.86s)]
*  I think that's what we need to do too. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=661.66s)]
*  Yeah, I like what you said about the conversations [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=663.82s)]
*  that you've had with President Biden [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=666.1s)]
*  about questioning people's... [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=668.02s)]
*  You know, you can have conversations, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=669.7s)]
*  you don't really need to question people's motives. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=671.74s)]
*  But I would like to end with this. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=674.16s)]
*  What's your personal mantra that gets you through? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=675.98s)]
*  Because I think I'm going to adopt whatever you're having. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=678.02s)]
*  What's your personal mantra, Mr. Secretary, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=680.66s)]
*  and then we're going to let you go. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=682.7s)]
*  You know, it's funny because one of the... [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=685.02s)]
*  I had a chance the other night to meet Rob Reiner, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=687.74s)]
*  the great director and actor, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=691.74s)]
*  and he made one of my favorite movies of all time, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=694.4200000000001s)]
*  this is Spinal Tap. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=696.82s)]
*  So this is probably the wrong thing to say, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=697.9s)]
*  but I told him, actually that movie has my mantra in it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=699.46s)]
*  One of the characters says at one point, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=703.94s)]
*  there's such a fine line between clever and stupid. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=706.1800000000001s)]
*  I try to stay on the right side of that line every day. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=709.4200000000001s)]
*  It's been an honor and thank you very much. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=715.54s)]
*  We are very grateful. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=716.9s)]
*  Great to be with you both. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=717.74s)]
*  We are very grateful. Thank you, sir. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=718.56s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCAza8k6CyI&t=720.9399999999999s)]
