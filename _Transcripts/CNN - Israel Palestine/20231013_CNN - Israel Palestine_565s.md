# Israel warns 1.1 million people to leave northern Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc)
*  Let's go straight to CNN International correspondent Ben Wiedemann. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=0.0s)]
*  He is in southern Lebanon. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=2.64s)]
*  Ben, the scale of this evacuation, this call for evacuation by the IDF, it's estimated [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=5.04s)]
*  to be more than a million people. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=12.08s)]
*  What's the plausibility of this actually happening? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=14.32s)]
*  It's going to be very difficult. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=17.52s)]
*  First of all, given the fact that the sheer number of people, perhaps 1.1 million people, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=20.96s)]
*  in a situation where there's very little fuel, the number of people, where are they going [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=27.56s)]
*  to go, where are they going to be housed? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=33.28s)]
*  The UN and other international organizations in Gaza are saying it's simply not possible, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=36.32s)]
*  given the number of people and the circumstances. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=43.08s)]
*  There's an active war. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=46.04s)]
*  People are afraid to just move in the streets. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=48.16s)]
*  So moving 1.1 million people from northern Gaza to the southern part is something that's [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  hard to imagine being done on practical terms. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=56.72s)]
*  Now, I've been in Gaza before, for instance. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=60.08s)]
*  In 2014, the Israelis ordered the evacuation of civilians from northern communities, ones [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=62.6s)]
*  near the Israeli border. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=69.24s)]
*  For the most part, people were able to do that because you could get out by walking, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=71.28s)]
*  you could get out by riding on a donkey cart, perhaps if you could get a car ride out. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=75.68s)]
*  But that was relatively small numbers compared to Gaza City. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=80.72s)]
*  Gaza City is huge. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=85.24s)]
*  Where are you going to put all these people when you move them south, when none of the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=87.2s)]
*  relief supplies, tents, food, water, medicine have been allowed into the Gaza Strip? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=91.32s)]
*  So it's very difficult to imagine how this could possibly be done. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=97.8s)]
*  And Hamas is calling on people to stay in their homes, to stay put. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=101.8s)]
*  So this is going to be very difficult. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=107.52s)]
*  And certainly, if people do not or cannot evacuate those areas the Israelis are calling [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=109.88s)]
*  them to leave and this ground offensive goes ahead, probability is will be a bloodbath. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=116.0s)]
*  Ben Wiedemann joining us in southern Lebanon. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=124.72s)]
*  Ben, thank you very much. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=126.91999999999999s)]
*  And joining us now to get more of these questions answered, IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  Peter Lerner. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=133.56s)]
*  Colonel, thank you for your time again this morning. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=134.56s)]
*  As always, I do want to ask you for confirmation on what Hamas is claiming, that 13 Israeli [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=137.2s)]
*  prisoners taken hostage during the weekend's attack, they are claiming they have been killed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=142.4s)]
*  in Gaza by Israeli bombings. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  Has the IDF confirmed those deaths? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=150.16s)]
*  Obviously, I can't confirm those. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=152.32s)]
*  And we have to be cautious with everything Hamas is saying. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=155.64s)]
*  And their propaganda efforts are extensive. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=159.12s)]
*  This morning we are continuing our activities against the Hamas terrorist organization and [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=163.4s)]
*  their infrastructure throughout the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=168.4s)]
*  Specifically, we are targeting special operations capabilities. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=171.88000000000002s)]
*  We've taken out their drone capabilities. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=176.56s)]
*  They had attack drones that were poisoned and prepared to be launched at Israel, but [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=179.36s)]
*  we've taken some of those out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=185.44000000000003s)]
*  And we are continuing our effort to make sure Hamas can never ever threaten Israel again. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=186.8s)]
*  They cannot be permitted to do so. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=191.88s)]
*  Do you not have confirmation of what Hamas is claiming there? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Do you have any update, Colonel, on the condition of all of the hostages, any of them, that [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=197.72s)]
*  are being held? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=203.28s)]
*  Well, to my knowledge, they've not released any information except for disinformation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=206.28s)]
*  And we're looking into it very cautiously. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=212.16s)]
*  The situation is as such. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=217.72s)]
*  We believe that Hamas are responsible for the well-being of all of the hostages that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=219.22s)]
*  they've taken. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=223.6s)]
*  And they need to return them immediately. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=224.88s)]
*  They need to release them to Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=226.8s)]
*  And they will bear the consequences for their actions. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=229.32s)]
*  The situation on the ground, obviously, is a complicated one. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=231.48s)]
*  And we're taking operating in caution with regard to the hostage situation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=236.48s)]
*  And of course, it is influencing our operational game plan. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=241.48s)]
*  How is it influencing it? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=248.0s)]
*  Is it causing the IDF not to take certain actions at this moment that it would otherwise [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=249.08s)]
*  take? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  I obviously won't elaborate on operational considerations, but definitely it is part [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  of the planning process. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=261.72s)]
*  And we do need to take that into consideration. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=263.44s)]
*  Our priority is to return them home as soon as possible. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=265.68s)]
*  The order from, recommendation from Israel for about 1.1 million people, according to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=269.24s)]
*  the UN, to move out of northern Gaza. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=278.76s)]
*  There have been some reports of a timeframe put on that. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=282.12s)]
*  Is there a timeframe that the IDF has put on that? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=285.2s)]
*  So the order is to evacuate immediately. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=290.2s)]
*  And I would highly recommend that people adhere to that instruction because the military is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=292.24s)]
*  determined to take out Hamas's capabilities. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  They operate from a stronghold within Gaza and Gaza City, and they can no longer be permitted [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=304.44s)]
*  to utilize that area to govern us. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=310.88000000000005s)]
*  So I would say, yes, the idea is in order to minimize and mitigate civilian casualties. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=313.44000000000005s)]
*  And this is what you've been asking us over the last couple of days. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=319.6s)]
*  What about humanitarian corridor? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=323.16s)]
*  This is part of the humanitarian effort so that people will not be influenced more than [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=324.48s)]
*  they have to be in this conflict. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=330.32s)]
*  Hamas, unfortunately, is calling on the other hand, people do not evacuate, stay and sacrifice [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=331.92s)]
*  themselves because that exemplifies exactly what we've been saying. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  Hamas has no regard for human life, Israeli or Palestinian. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=340.0s)]
*  They will sacrifice everybody as they are proving time and time again. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=343.64000000000004s)]
*  The question is, is there a safe window for all of those people, a million plus people, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=348.44s)]
*  to evacuate to the south? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  The United Nations says it is, quote, impossible for such a movement to take place without [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=355.06s)]
*  devastating humanitarian consequences as these airstrikes continue. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=359.98s)]
*  So here's what we do. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=366.66s)]
*  When we saw a threat on the border with Gaza, we evacuated the people from the border with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=368.18s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=372.70000000000005s)]
*  What is Hamas doing? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  They're not doing anything. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  They are sacrificing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=375.78000000000003s)]
*  They're telling them, no, stay put. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  The IDF isn't coming. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=378.22s)]
*  The IDF is operating. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=379.76s)]
*  We are operating extensively. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=381.24s)]
*  When they place their drone, their offensive drones, their strike drones, their suicide [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=383.14s)]
*  drones on the roofs of houses, they are jeopardizing everybody in that house. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=387.66s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=392.36s)]
*  So we're telling people, evacuate this area because we are operating. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=393.5s)]
*  We plan on broadening the scope of our operations in order to achieve our goal. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=396.82s)]
*  Colonel, I'm going to move on. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=401.42s)]
*  But what I'm trying to understand is, is there a window of safety? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=402.82s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=405.34000000000003s)]
*  The UN has said 24 hours, for example. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=406.34000000000003s)]
*  Is there a window of safety when this evacuation of the... [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=408.02s)]
*  I'm really recommending that the evacuation takes place immediately. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=412.78s)]
*  The window of the 24 hours that we're talking about is the highly recommendation, but it [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=418.26s)]
*  could go on beyond that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=423.85999999999996s)]
*  But I would say the instruction is, get up and get out of the north of Gaza and Gaza [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=425.58s)]
*  City and move to the south. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=431.09999999999997s)]
*  And just to be clear, though, move to the south, but there is still no crossing out [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=434.05999999999995s)]
*  of Gaza for them. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, we're directing them exactly where we expect them not to be, where people, in order [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=441.74s)]
*  to safeguard their own lives, should move from. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=448.46000000000004s)]
*  Not to go into Egypt or anything like that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=452.58s)]
*  But they should not be in the area which we designated and have told them specifically. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=455.7s)]
*  Now, this is like a forewarning of where we're operating, forewarning of where is going to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=459.62s)]
*  be more extensive combat, where there are going to be more extensive strikes. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=465.18s)]
*  This is the whole idea of trying to safeguard people's lives. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=470.5s)]
*  The instruction to leave is to save people's lives. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=475.65999999999997s)]
*  So they should leave from the north of Gaza, from the Gaza City. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=478.94s)]
*  They should go to the south of the city, of the Gaza Wadi, and they should set up there. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=482.5s)]
*  If they stay, they are jeopardizing themselves. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=491.14s)]
*  This is what I'm trying to say. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=492.85999999999996s)]
*  I know that there are concerns and considerations. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=494.38s)]
*  There are problems, of course. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=497.38s)]
*  I would say Hamas need to deal with all of those problems of how to shift people from [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=499.3s)]
*  the north to the south, like we did. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=503.3s)]
*  We took people from their houses in the south of Israel and we moved them elsewhere. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=505.34000000000003s)]
*  And Hamas have the responsibility, rather than failing the people of Gaza, they should [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=509.3s)]
*  help the people of Gaza. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=514.38s)]
*  And then Colonel, I think the question becomes, for how long can they remain in the south? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=516.0600000000001s)]
*  Will an order like Israel has given in the north then come to them in the south? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=522.5s)]
*  If there is no crossing, that opens. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=529.4599999999999s)]
*  Our operation is focused towards Hamas, not to the people of Gaza, because the people [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=533.26s)]
*  of Gaza are not our enemy. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=537.9s)]
*  The Hamas terrorist organization has butchered over 1,200 people in Israel, cannot be permitted [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=540.18s)]
*  to govern the Gaza Strip and use it as a staging ground against Israel. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=548.66s)]
*  So when we recommend to the people of Gaza, go to the south, you should listen, go to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=553.54s)]
*  the south. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=557.74s)]
*  Do not stay in Gaza City, do not stay in the north. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=558.74s)]
*  And yes, everybody should listen to that recommendation. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-9-A00vMoc&t=561.94s)]
