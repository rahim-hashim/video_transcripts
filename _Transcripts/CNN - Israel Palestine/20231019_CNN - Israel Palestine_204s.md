# Israel conducts West Bank raids amidst conflict with Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo)
*  Sarah, Israel has been conducting some raids out in the West Bank as it wages this war [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=0.0s)]
*  against Hamas. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=4.84s)]
*  How extensive are these Israeli military operations? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=5.96s)]
*  Very extensive, to say the least. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=11.96s)]
*  The Israeli military says it has been conducting wide-scale, what it calls counterterrorism [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=14.52s)]
*  activity in the West Bank, where they have arrested more than 60 Palestinians in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=19.84s)]
*  last day or so. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=26.48s)]
*  I should also mention that the tensions in the West Bank are very, very high, especially [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=27.88s)]
*  after that blast at the hospital, because the Palestinians basically do not believe [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=33.36s)]
*  the Israeli evidence or Israeli military's intelligence that Israel was not responsible [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=37.92s)]
*  for that blast. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  And they don't believe the U.S. intelligence that seems to, at this point, confirm the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=46.4s)]
*  Israeli intelligence. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=51.04s)]
*  They believe that it was undertaken by Israel, and that is something that they certainly [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=52.84s)]
*  cannot forgive and have been out protesting in very large numbers. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  But there have been smaller-scale clashes that have ended in deaths of Palestinians. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=61.68s)]
*  The Palestinian authorities said that there are about seven Palestinians who have been [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=66.28s)]
*  killed overnight during one of those raids by the Israeli military. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=69.92s)]
*  And so, you know, the Israeli military says in that operation in Tulkarim, they went into [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=77.36s)]
*  a refugee camp and ended up arresting about 10 people there, but seven Palestinians, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=83.04s)]
*  according to the P.A., were killed. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=88.52000000000001s)]
*  That is just ratcheting up the tensions, as you might imagine, in the West Bank, which, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=91.12s)]
*  of course, is not run by Hamas. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=95.56s)]
*  It is run by what the international community recognizes as the leader of the Palestinian [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=97.64s)]
*  people, the Palestinian Authority Wolf. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  Sarah, how fearful are Palestinians over there on the West Bank of Israeli settler violence? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  Look, there has been an uptick, a big uptick of violence by settlers against Palestinians. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=110.48s)]
*  I don't know if the word is fear. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=116.72s)]
*  Yes, that is there, but it's more anger. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=118.56s)]
*  It's more rage in having to deal with that as well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=120.4s)]
*  We do know that there has been an uptick because of this group named Beit Salam and others [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=124.56s)]
*  looking at the activity of settlers in the area, which has always been a flashpoint for [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians everywhere, but specifically and particularly in the West Bank. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=137.76s)]
*  I want to let you see what Beit Salam, this group that tracks settler violence that does not, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  that believes that there is a full occupation by Israel that needs to end. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=149.68s)]
*  They say that the settler violence against Palestinians has risen in both frequency and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  intensity, with soldiers and police officers fully backing the assailants under the cover of war. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  Settlers are carrying out such assaults virtually unchecked. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=166.08s)]
*  That is the group Beit Salam, the Israeli human rights organization. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=170.16s)]
*  I also want to mention there are about 700,000 settlers in the West Bank, but conversely, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=173.36s)]
*  they're terrified as well and they will tell you so. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=179.68s)]
*  And they constantly say, look, we feel like we are just defending ourselves, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=183.12s)]
*  defending our families. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=186.48s)]
*  And so you have this awful back and forth between the two groups. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=187.68s)]
*  But internationally, the settlements are not recognized and are considered [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=191.6s)]
*  illegal, but this is a battle that has been going on long before this major war has started. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  Sarah Seidner reporting from Jerusalem. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtF_tHyPjdo&t=202.16s)]
