# Will Israel strike Iran's nuclear sites? Hear what expert thinks
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw)
*  I want to bring in CNN political and global affairs analyst Barak Ravid right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=0.0s)]
*  Barak, what do you anticipate? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=4.16s)]
*  Because as you know and as I know and as Anderson knows, the Israelis have always suggested [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=7.0s)]
*  that the greatest potential threat to Israel from all over the area would be an Iranian [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=11.56s)]
*  nuclear strike against Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Iran has been working on a nuclear bomb, as we all know, and they're getting closer and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=21.16s)]
*  closer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=25.2s)]
*  How worried should the world be right now about that type of Iranian attack against [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=26.2s)]
*  Israel? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=31.2s)]
*  Hi, Wolf. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=32.2s)]
*  Well, the Israeli Security Cabinet is sitting right now in an underground bunker in the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=35.2s)]
*  mountains near Jerusalem to discuss exactly that, whether there could be another attack [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=42.04s)]
*  from Iran and what's going to be the Israeli response to the attack we just saw. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=48.76s)]
*  The Iranians obviously still do not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=54.76s)]
*  Israeli intelligence services think that it will take them at least another year, between [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=59.56s)]
*  one to two years, to build a nuclear device that you can put on a missile and launch. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=65.52s)]
*  So in that sense, there's no such threat at the moment. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=71.92s)]
*  But I think what we're going to see in the next few hours is a very, very severe response [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=76.8s)]
*  from Israel to this Iranian attack that will not look in any way like the Israeli response [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=83.04s)]
*  to the Iranian attack in April that was just launching one missile at one anti-aircraft [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=90.04s)]
*  battery in an air base near Isfahan. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=96.48s)]
*  I think we're going to see a very, very serious response. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=99.76s)]
*  I think you're absolutely right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=103.28s)]
*  And I asked the question about the nuclear potential there, Barack, because as you well [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=104.88s)]
*  know, and as I know, over the years, the Israelis have always said that they would love an opportunity [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=109.48s)]
*  to preempt and destroy Iran's potential nuclear capability. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=115.6s)]
*  There have been many top Israeli military officials and others who have said that the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=121.08s)]
*  Israelis should do so before Iran actually has a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=125.44s)]
*  What are the prospects, do you think, that even though Iran is not yet capable of launching [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=131.88s)]
*  a nuclear strike in Israel, Israel would use this moment to try to undermine Iran's nuclear [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  capability? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=142.1s)]
*  We know over the past few years Israel has attacked various Iranian nuclear scientists, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=142.9s)]
*  among others. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=148.94s)]
*  I think the Iranian attack today gave all the justification to the Israeli government [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  to go ahead with what you just described. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=159.57999999999998s)]
*  For many years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was thinking about such a move. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=162.58s)]
*  And the conditions right now, I think, are maybe more mature than any time before for [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=169.38s)]
*  an Israeli attack against the Iranian nuclear program, especially that one of the problems [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=177.78s)]
*  Netanyahu had over the years was that the IDF was very hesitant from taking such a step. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=184.78s)]
*  The current IDF leadership is in a different place right now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=191.66s)]
*  And it is, I think, very much willing to consider such a move and to even recommend such a move [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=195.74s)]
*  to the Israeli cabinet. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=204.46s)]
*  Barak, you have excellent Israeli sources and excellent U.S. sources. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=206.3s)]
*  How serious is the tension? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=211.06s)]
*  How serious is the disagreement over what's going on right now between the U.S. and Israel? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=213.1s)]
*  Honestly, I don't think there's a disagreement. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=219.1s)]
*  I think that in the last few days or in the last two weeks since the Pager attacks, I [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=223.62s)]
*  think the U.S. and Israel has been actually getting closer when it comes to their thinking [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=232.22s)]
*  about what's going on in the region. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=237.94s)]
*  The U.S. was definitely unhappy by the fact that the Pager attacks and the walkie talkie [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  attacks and the Nusra'a assassination all happened without a prior notice and without [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=246.1s)]
*  consultation. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=253.1s)]
*  But at the same time, I haven't heard even one senior U.S. official who is involved in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=254.14s)]
*  the decision-making who does not think that those Israeli attacks were at the end of the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=261.62s)]
*  day the right thing to do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=267.62s)]
*  And even when it comes to the ground operation Israel started in southern Lebanon yesterday, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=270.09999999999997s)]
*  I haven't heard from any significant U.S. official who is in the decision-making any [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=275.42s)]
*  criticism about this ground operation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=282.42s)]
*  Quite the contrary. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=285.02s)]
*  So I think that in many ways in the last two weeks the Israeli government and the White [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=286.54s)]
*  House, regardless of the fact that there are personal issues between Biden and Netanyahu, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=293.54s)]
*  but overall I do not think that there are major tensions or crisis right now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=298.1s)]
*  I think actually the opposite. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=305.1s)]
*  I want to go to the White House and Kayla Toushi. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=306.82000000000005s)]
*  So I understand President Biden was in briefings this morning. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=309.54s)]
*  He was in briefings this morning with his national security team and with Vice President [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=313.82000000000005s)]
*  Harris and we've learned Anderson that the Vice President and the President together [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=317.5s)]
*  were in the situation monitoring these attacks as they were carried out by Iran and plotting [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=321.5s)]
*  how the U.S. would continue coming to Israel's defense. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=327.22s)]
*  The national security spokesperson saying that President Biden directed the U.S. to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=330.06s)]
*  continue assisting Israel in shooting down the missiles that Iran was firing and to continue [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=334.42s)]
*  to provide those defenses to Israel. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=340.74s)]
*  But what's interesting Anderson and Wolf is that this comes after nearly a year of ambivalence [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=343.66s)]
*  and handwringing by the administration, fears that there would be escalation that would [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=349.14s)]
*  lead to a wider war. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=353.94s)]
*  And their diplomatic efforts have really had the primary goal of trying to thwart that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=355.58s)]
*  from happening. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=360.18s)]
*  And in recent weeks, they've been bracing for that potential, starting with the targeted [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=361.18s)]
*  strike that killed the political leader of Hamas, Ismael Haniya in late July, then followed [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=366.06s)]
*  by several other attacks that were carried out. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=372.24s)]
*  The pager and walkie talkie attack against several Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon and then [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=374.86s)]
*  of these raids in Lebanon and then the killing of the leader of Hezbollah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=379.82s)]
*  Obviously, this has all reached a fever pitch at a time when the Biden administration has [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=385.58s)]
*  been working feverishly behind the scenes to advance these fire proposals both for war [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=389.54s)]
*  in Gaza as well as the escalating situation in Lebanon. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=394.7s)]
*  And those efforts have continued to remain elusive. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=398.26s)]
*  So now as we await concurrent briefings from the Pentagon, the State Department and the [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=401.62s)]
*  There is still a very large question of how the administration can move forward with its [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  diplomatic efforts at a time when it appears that its potency with the Israeli government [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=411.74s)]
*  and the advice that it's been trying to give behind the scenes has fallen on deaf ears. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=417.94s)]
*  Anderson, Wolf? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=422.26s)]
*  Yeah, the White House. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=423.26s)]
*  We know that the U.S. has pre-positioned more assets in the region, destroyer in the Eastern [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=424.26s)]
*  Mediterranean, carrier strike group in the Arabian Sea as well as fighter jet squadrons. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=430.78s)]
*  Clearly, the desire of the U.S., the intent, the objective of that major deployment of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  troops and equipment by the United States in the Eastern Mediterranean and elsewhere [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=440.02s)]
*  in the region is designed to help Israel if necessary but also designed to try to deter [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=444.18s)]
*  either Iran or its proxies from using this moment to try to escalate this situation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  We'll see how that unfolds. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=454.97999999999996s)]
*  It didn't deter the Iranians from launching all those ballistic missiles towards Israel [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=456.41999999999996s)]
*  over the past few hours. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=460.41999999999996s)]
*  Okay, Latoschi, thank you very, very much. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=461.74s)]
*  We're also hearing now that the Israeli military has just announced that citizens in the Tel [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=464.62s)]
*  Aviv area can leave their shelters. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=468.94s)]
*  Nick Robertson is joining us from Haifa in northern Israel right now. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=471.62s)]
*  So Nick, give us a sense of what's happening in Haifa where you are. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=475.46s)]
*  Well, Wolf, still hearing fast fighter jets overhead, clearly engaged in operations in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=481.9s)]
*  Lebanon just to the north of us here. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=489.78000000000003s)]
*  I just want to draw us perhaps closer to the events of tonight. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=492.38s)]
*  One of the air bases in southern Israel that was targeted by Iran tonight, one of their [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=496.34s)]
*  stated targets, I was at that air base over the weekend. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=502.02s)]
*  I was at that air base because I was invited to go on a combat mission that was targeting [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=505.62s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=512.98s)]
*  I was on a refuel aircraft refueling F-35s that carried out that targeted mission on [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=514.5799999999999s)]
*  the Houthis in Hudaydah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=520.5s)]
*  The reason for that targeting was that one of the reasons was to send a message to Iran [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=522.1s)]
*  not to get involved in the fight right now. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=527.5799999999999s)]
*  So I find it significant that the Iranians have targeted that base. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  They have tried to target it before, and I won't give away operational details of the [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=534.66s)]
*  nature of that base and everything that's at that base. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=540.3s)]
*  But I can tell you it is an important and a very significant base for the Israeli Air [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=543.62s)]
*  Force. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=549.38s)]
*  I think when we consider as well what triggered Iran to launch this attack now, we don't know. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=550.42s)]
*  But it is less than 24 hours ago that Israel changed its tactics against Hezbollah and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=558.06s)]
*  decided to go on a ground offensive into Lebanon. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=563.3s)]
*  One of the reasons I say this is because the impression that Iran has created by not backing [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=567.66s)]
*  up Hezbollah more forcefully until now, while their leadership has been decimated, their [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=573.14s)]
*  command and control has been decimated, their military arsenal has been decimated, is that [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=579.3s)]
*  Iran has appeared to stand on the sidelines. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=585.02s)]
*  And as Hezbollah was Iran's major ally to attack Israel, if Israel tried to attack Iran, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=588.54s)]
*  the fact that they were being so decimated was beginning to open the same realization [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOCqZc_nrBw&t=597.0999999999999s)]
