# Jake Sullivan clarifies US involvement in operation to rescue four Israeli hostages
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o)
*  Hello, I'm Dana Bash in Washington where the state of our union is looking overseas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=0.0s)]
*  After eight long months, four Israeli hostages are back home safely. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=6.44s)]
*  Family reunions and tears of joy after they were rescued from Hamas captivity by IDF forces [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=11.6s)]
*  in a special operation Saturday morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=18.04s)]
*  The raid of two separate apartments in a central Gaza refugee camp took months of preparation, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=20.92s)]
*  a military spokesman said, since Hamas moves hostages frequently and embeds them in areas [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=26.48s)]
*  packed with civilians like this refugee camp. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=32.4s)]
*  Following reports of heavy shelling and artillery fire, Gaza Hospital said more than 200 people [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=35.6s)]
*  were killed in the operation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=40.96s)]
*  CNN has not been able to verify claims about the exact number of civilian deaths in what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=42.64s)]
*  was the first successful hostage rescue since February. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=47.92s)]
*  Here with me now from Paris where he is traveling with President Biden is national security [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=53.36s)]
*  adviser Jake Sullivan. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with me. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=61.12s)]
*  Let's start of course with the news about the rescue of four Israeli hostages inside [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=63.04s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=69.28s)]
*  How specifically did the US assist in the mission? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=70.4s)]
*  Well, Dana, the United States has been providing support to Israel for several months in its [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=74.16s)]
*  efforts to help identify the locations of hostages in Gaza and to support efforts to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=81.6s)]
*  try to secure their rescue or recovery. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=87.6s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the specific operational or intelligence related matters associated [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  with that because we need to protect those. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  I can only just say that we have generally provided support to the IDF so that we can [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=97.44s)]
*  try to get all of the hostages home, including the American hostages who are still being [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=103.28s)]
*  held. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=106.88s)]
*  So I understand that intelligence, US intelligence assisted. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=108.72s)]
*  But will you say anything about US personnel, US weapons? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=114.08s)]
*  Well, the one thing I can say is that there were no US forces, no US youth, no US boots [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=121.28s)]
*  on the ground involved in this operation. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=125.52s)]
*  We did not participate militarily in this operation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=127.44s)]
*  Jake, Amos claims that other hostages that they are holding inside Gaza were killed as [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=130.88s)]
*  a result of the IDF's mission. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=141.6s)]
*  We have not seen that verified or confirmed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=146.0s)]
*  I believe that the Israelis have said they do not have any information to that effect. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=148.72s)]
*  But of course, that is always a risk with all of these military operations. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  The hostages have been killed over the last eight months. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=157.28s)]
*  And so, Dana, the best way to get all of the hostages home and to protect Palestinian civilians [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  is to end this war. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say yes to the deal President Biden announced [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=165.92s)]
*  and that Israel has accepted, which lays out a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  return of all hostages. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=175.44s)]
*  That's what we are driving for. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=176.88s)]
*  And that's what we're asking the world to call upon Hamas to accept. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=177.92s)]
*  Are you concerned at all, given what you just said, that the ball is in Hamas' court [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=182.32s)]
*  right now, that the rescue that happened on Saturday will make it so that Hamas might [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=189.04s)]
*  walk away from the negotiating table? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=200.0s)]
*  It's a legitimate question. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=205.2s)]
*  It's hard for me to put myself in the mindset of a Hamas terrorist. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=207.28s)]
*  We don't know exactly what it is that they're going to do. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=210.4s)]
*  But the basic bottom line here is straightforward. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  To bring an end to this war, to get the hostages home, to get the full scope of humanitarian [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=215.68s)]
*  aid to the Palestinian people in a safe and effective way, we need this deal. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=220.88s)]
*  And all of the people all over the world, in the United States and in countries everywhere [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=224.88s)]
*  who have been calling for a ceasefire, they need to train their attention on Hamas and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=228.56s)]
*  put the pressure on because this is the way to resolve this issue. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=233.12s)]
*  And whatever the calculus is of Hamas coming out of this weekend, the reality remains the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  same. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  This is the only credible path forward, and Hamas should say yes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  Any word either from Hamas or through Hamas' intermediaries about their stance vis-Ã -vis [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  the ceasefire deal that the president endorsed a little bit more than a week ago [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=258.16s)]
*  since what happened yesterday? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, we've heard a lot publicly from Hamas over the last week. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=268.0s)]
*  We've not seen any official statements since what happened with the hostage rescue operation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=272.96s)]
*  And the two key Arab mediators who are standing alongside the United States in this process, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=278.32s)]
*  Qatar and Egypt, have not yet received any official word from Hamas representatives [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=283.44s)]
*  as to their stance on the deal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=289.52s)]
*  So we are waiting that word. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=290.88s)]
*  And it should come today. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=292.4s)]
*  It should come this hour. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=294.0s)]
*  Hamas should say yes, which would immediately put in place a ceasefire and immediately begin [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=295.04s)]
*  the process of bringing hostages home. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=300.64000000000004s)]
*  This is the answer that the world is looking for, and it's time to act. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=302.72s)]
*  Jake, I want to ask you a little bit more about that mission. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=308.0s)]
*  And one of the questions is what we're hearing from Gaza. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=311.68s)]
*  Two different hospitals in Gaza say at least 236 people were killed as a part of the Israeli [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=315.76s)]
*  operation to rescue hostages. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=324.16s)]
*  What is your understanding of how many Palestinian civilians, not militants, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  but civilians were killed in that rescue mission? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=332.56s)]
*  We, the United States, are not in a position today to make a definitive statement about that. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=339.44000000000005s)]
*  The Israeli defense forces have put out one number. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=343.92s)]
*  The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry has put out another number. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=347.12s)]
*  But we do know this, Dana. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=350.32000000000005s)]
*  Innocent people were tragically killed in this operation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=352.48s)]
*  The exact number we don't know, but innocent people were killed. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=355.68s)]
*  And that is heartbreaking. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  That is tragic. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=359.92s)]
*  The president himself has said in recent days that the Palestinian people are going through [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=361.6s)]
*  sheer hell in this conflict because Hamas is operating in a way that puts them in the crossfire, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  that holds hostages right in the heart of crowded civilian areas, that puts military [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  emplacements right in the heart of crowded civilian areas. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=376.16s)]
*  But every day that we see more innocent people lost is another horrible, awful, tragic day. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=379.04s)]
*  And, you know, our hearts in the United States and across the world break for that. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=386.48s)]
*  But there is only one answer to stop that from happening going forward. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  And that is a ceasefire and hostage deal that ends the military operations, brings the hostages [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  home, and puts us in a position to give the Palestinians an opportunity for a better future [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=403.44s)]
*  for their people. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=408.16s)]
*  And last, just about the mission. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=410.40000000000003s)]
*  You don't want to specifically say how the U.S. was involved, which I understand, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  but just broadly, big picture. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=419.36s)]
*  No one can deny the amazing news of seeing these innocent civilians who were finally [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  brought back to their families from Gaza after being held there for eight months. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=429.92s)]
*  But is the U.S. comfortable with the way that the Israelis carried out the mission? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=434.16s)]
*  Look, Dana, why is President Biden going out publicly and calling for a ceasefire and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=443.92s)]
*  hostage deal? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=448.16s)]
*  It's because he thinks the best way to get all of the hostages home is in a deal where [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=448.8s)]
*  they're brought out diplomatically, where there's no need for military operations to get every last [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  hostage out. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=457.44000000000005s)]
*  So that would obviously be the best solution to this. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=458.48s)]
*  In the absence of that, without Hamas saying yes to the deal, unfortunately, we are going [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=461.52s)]
*  to continue to see ongoing conflict and military operations in which Israel makes efforts to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=467.12s)]
*  recover its citizens and, frankly, to recover American citizens. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  What we would much prefer to see is a ceasefire where the hostages come out peacefully. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=476.4s)]
*  That is available. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  Israel has said yes to it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=484.0s)]
*  Now Hamas needs to say yes to it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  That's where President Biden's full effort, energy and attention is. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=487.91999999999996s)]
*  And you heard yesterday from the French president here in Paris that France stands behind that, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=491.52s)]
*  the world stands behind that, and Hamas should come to the table and say yes. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=496.32s)]
*  You mentioned that you are in Paris. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  I have to, before I let you go, ask about the trip that you and, of course, the president is [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=501.59999999999997s)]
*  making to Europe, marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=507.2s)]
*  You are soon going to be part of the G7 in Italy. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=510.88s)]
*  And the president gave a very big speech on democracy as he is trying to frame the 2024 [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=514.8s)]
*  presidential election here against Donald Trump as a discussion about the fate of democracy. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=520.16s)]
*  Do you think democracy is in jeopardy? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=528.8s)]
*  The president said in his speech that democracy is at risk all over the world from [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=534.96s)]
*  without and from within to a greater extent now than it has been in a very long time. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=540.48s)]
*  And what President Biden was arguing is that those brave men who stormed the beaches at [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=546.24s)]
*  Normandy, who scaled the cliffs at Pointe-Ã -Hoc, who liberated Europe and literally saved the world, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=551.28s)]
*  they are calling us to step up to do our job in our time, which is to defend democracy, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRxrebQrR4o&t=558.0s)]
