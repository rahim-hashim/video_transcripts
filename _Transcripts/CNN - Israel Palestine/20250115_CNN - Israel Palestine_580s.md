# Israel and Hamas agree to Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, source says
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c)
*  This is a massive deal weeks in the making. Alex, it certainly is. If not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=0.0s)]
*  longer, Pam, we have been waiting for more than 13 months since the last [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=4.0s)]
*  ceasefire deal in the last since the last time there was an exchange of [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=9.02s)]
*  hostages and prisoners for this moment. It appears that this deal is imminent. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=11.96s)]
*  If not done already, we're reporting that Hamas has agreed to the deal. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=17.92s)]
*  There was certainly an expectation from the Israeli side that they would agree [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=22.84s)]
*  all of this, of course, brokered after intensive negotiations with the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=27.0s)]
*  mediators, the United States, Qatar and Egypt. So this is obviously extremely [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=32.16s)]
*  welcome news after some 14 months of fighting. And what we expect to happen, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=38.16s)]
*  um, if indeed this deal goes into effect is that over the course of some six [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=43.96s)]
*  weeks, we would see more than 30 Israeli hostages released by Hamas and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=49.92s)]
*  other groups who are holding them in Gaza. I don't think we had the exact [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=56.1s)]
*  number of Palestinian prisoners who would be released by Israel. And then [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=59.580000000000005s)]
*  they're all, uh, there are a bunch of other different elements that would go [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=64.06s)]
*  into effect. Got Palestinians would be allowed to go home in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=68.14s)]
*  More humanitarian aid would get to go in. But I think the point here, Pam, is [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=71.58s)]
*  that after weeks of feverish work on the U. S. Side with both Biden [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=76.18s)]
*  administration officials and officials from the incoming trump team working in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=81.54s)]
*  coordination with each other, they and the other mediators have managed to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=86.04s)]
*  get the Israelis and Hamas. It appears across the finish line where we are [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=89.84s)]
*  going to get a truce, a pause in this fighting. One thing I really want to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  emphasize is this does not mean the end of this war. This means a break in this [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  war. Hopefully this break will last at least six weeks. If not longer, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=105.06s)]
*  hopefully all of these people will come home who are supposed to come home. But [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  there are big questions about what would happen after this first phase of a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=114.46000000000001s)]
*  ceasefire, which as it stands now, and this plan has been in place for quite [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=117.98s)]
*  some time since President Biden laid it out in May, this is expected to last [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=122.42s)]
*  around six weeks. So we're still waiting for final word, I believe from all of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=126.88s)]
*  the parties. But this certainly seems imminent, if not a done deal already. I [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=130.9s)]
*  want to go back to M. J. Lee at the White House. I believe we're reconnected [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=135.22s)]
*  in J. What can you tell us about this plan? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, Pam, according to a senior administration official telling CNN it [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=141.33999999999997s)]
*  is done, it is confirmed, meaning that Hamas has given that final green light [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=147.1s)]
*  agreeing to the ceasefire and hostages release deal that had been on the table [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=152.7s)]
*  for a while. And based on all of our reporting, we knew that this really was [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=158.98s)]
*  the final step that all of the parties were waiting for that. It really came [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=164.17999999999998s)]
*  down to this group agreeing to the parameters that everybody else had [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=168.3s)]
*  agreed to. Part of the reason we have been so cautious in our reporting all [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=173.5s)]
*  of this time is precisely that that just that in the end, it came down to Hamas [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=179.18s)]
*  giving this final green light. And when we have spoken to at least U. S. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=184.62s)]
*  officials involved in these discussions and with knowledge of the situation, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  they always pointed to the fact that it was impossible to make any kind of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=193.38s)]
*  predictions with certainty because at the end of the day they were dealing with [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  Hamas. But again, here we have a confirmation from a senior administration [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=202.9s)]
*  official that Hamas has finally given the green light and there is a deal for a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=207.26s)]
*  ceasefire in Gaza and for the hostages to be released. This is a deal, as you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=212.58s)]
*  were talking about just now with Alex, that has been elusive for the Biden [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=218.62s)]
*  administration and for the U. S. For so many months, you know, we had that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=222.98s)]
*  initial ceasefire back more than a year ago around Thanksgiving to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=227.22s)]
*  Thanksgiving ago when a number of hostages came out. That ceasefire ended [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=232.78s)]
*  up being temporary, only lasting a number of days. And really, since then [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=237.73999999999998s)]
*  U. S. officials have been working to get a second part of the ceasefire in place, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  but it had been so, so challenging. There were so many moments throughout the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=246.26s)]
*  last year plus where we reported that things look like they were maybe getting [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=251.1s)]
*  close, that we have reason for optimism based on our sources and our reporting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=256.62s)]
*  But even in these final days, you know, everybody we had talked to were so [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=261.5s)]
*  careful to almost not get their hopes up too much. I think we should spend a good [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=265.5s)]
*  deal amount of time talking about Donald Trump and the incoming president's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=270.1s)]
*  desire to get this done that had been really so decisive in the end and helping [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=274.42s)]
*  to get this across the finish line. Certainly. Uh, and just for our viewers, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=279.42s)]
*  just to remind you in terms of the numbers, Hamas and its allies hold 94 [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=284.26s)]
*  people taken from Israel on October 7th 2023. The majority are civilians. 34 are [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=289.2s)]
*  confirmed dead, but the number is almost certainly higher than that. 81 are men [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=296.3s)]
*  and 13 women, and there are two under the age of five. Um, and of course [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=300.74s)]
*  there's going to be phases as Alex had laid out. Some will be released in the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  first phase during the expected ceasefire. I want to go straight to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=309.42s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, who is on the ground there and Israel to get the Israel part [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  of this because there's a process in Israel, right? Jeremy, walk us through [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=318.02s)]
*  that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=321.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. Pam. And first of all, I think it's important to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=324.12s)]
*  note that for the last two days, the Israeli government Israeli government [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=326.98s)]
*  officials who I've been speaking with have been saying this is in Hamas's [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=330.08s)]
*  hands. We need Hamas to say yes in order to get to a deal. And that is [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=333.74s)]
*  indeed what has now happened. And so for all intents and purposes, we do [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=337.94s)]
*  indeed now have an agreement between these parties to go into a ceasefire [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  that is expected to last six weeks, during which you will see 33 Israeli [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=347.94s)]
*  hostages released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners released from [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  Israeli jails in exchange the much needed entry of humanitarian aid. But [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=355.7s)]
*  the process that now needs to happen here in Israel in order for this deal [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=360.34s)]
*  to actually become a reality. This agreement will now go from the Israeli [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=364.54s)]
*  prime minister. He will take this agreement before his security cabinet, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=369.3s)]
*  which is a smaller group of his governing coalition, some of his top [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=373.5s)]
*  ministers primarily involved in security affairs. They will then give an [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=377.92s)]
*  up or down vote on this. If it is approved, it will then go to the full [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=381.66s)]
*  cabinet for approval. And only then will the Israeli government be able to [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=385.22s)]
*  officially sign off on this deal and begin marching towards implementation. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=390.54s)]
*  There is one additional hurdle before implementation, and that is giving the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=395.46s)]
*  individuals who were impacted by those Palestinian prisoners who will be [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=400.38s)]
*  released the opportunity to petition the Supreme Court against their release. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=405.1s)]
*  That is largely a formality. The Israeli government has enormous leverage, and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=409.94s)]
*  the prime minister in particular has enormous freedom to release those [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=415.22s)]
*  prisoners as it relates to security matters. So that will likely be a 24 hour [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=418.58000000000004s)]
*  period that will go by, and that likely takes us most likely to Sunday, which is [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=422.86s)]
*  what I've been told is the most likely date when this deal will actually be [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=429.02000000000004s)]
*  implemented on the ground. That will mean that we will see the first Israeli [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=433.06s)]
*  hostages in more than a year be released as part of a diplomatic agreement here [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=437.74s)]
*  for these hostages to come out of Gaza. You will see the release of Palestinian [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=443.42s)]
*  prisoners from Israeli jails. And in addition to that, of course, you will [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=448.38s)]
*  see Israeli jets, Israeli troops on the ground lower their weapons. And for the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  first time in in in over a year, you will finally see the guns be silenced [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=460.1s)]
*  here and the people of Gaza will finally get a much needed reprieve from the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=467.58s)]
*  military assault that they have been undergoing over the last year. All right. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=472.78s)]
*  Thank you so much, Jeremy. I want to go to CNN foreign policy reporter Barack [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=476.5s)]
*  ravied. What can you tell us about this deal? And when the Hamas prisoners will [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=481.58s)]
*  be released, those held hostage, I should say, and the Palestinian prisoners [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=487.06s)]
*  as well. What more can you tell us about that? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=490.82s)]
*  So I think one of the most important things that our viewers need to know [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  right now is that there are seven Americans held by Hamas in Gaza. Two of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=497.46s)]
*  them are expected to be released in this initial phase of the hostage deal. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=504.18s)]
*  One of them is U.S. citizen Keith Siegel that a video of him from captivity was [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=512.02s)]
*  aired a few months ago, and he is in the list for this first phase. Another U.S. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=519.58s)]
*  U.S. citizen is a significant hand. Another U.S. citizen who is on the list [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=525.22s)]
*  of the 33 hostages expected to be released in this initial phase. And I think [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=530.5799999999999s)]
*  what is very interesting is that this deal has been in the making for months [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=537.3399999999999s)]
*  since President Biden laid out his plan, his proposal last May and U.S. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=542.54s)]
*  negotiators, Qatari negotiators, Egyptian negotiators, Israeli negotiators have [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=549.4599999999999s)]
*  been working on this for months. I think the breakthrough came when the deal with [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=555.02s)]
*  Hezbollah on the ceasefire in Lebanon happened because then Hamas in Gaza [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=560.22s)]
*  understood that it has been left alone and that no one's coming to save them. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=565.26s)]
*  And since then, what I hear from Israeli news officials, since then they saw a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=570.3000000000001s)]
*  change in how Hamas is negotiating this deal. And this is how we got to this point. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vcIXogcQ3c&t=574.5400000000001s)]
