# Blinken on why international community slow to address sexual violence committed by Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc)
*  Joining me now is Secretary of State Antony Blinken. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thanks for joining us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=2.64s)]
*  So the U.S. stood alone at the U.N. Security Council [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=4.04s)]
*  on Friday to block the ceasefire, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=7.88s)]
*  and the administration is sidestepping Congress [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=9.36s)]
*  to rush more weapons to Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=11.4s)]
*  You said this week there is, quote, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=13.08s)]
*  a gap between the intent to protect Palestinian civilians [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=14.74s)]
*  and the actual results that we're seeing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=19.56s)]
*  on the ground in Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=21.72s)]
*  Can you describe that gap? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  What is Israel doing right now that you think [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=24.88s)]
*  does not demonstrate enough care or protection [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=27.0s)]
*  of Palestinian civilians? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=31.64s)]
*  Jake, we think there needs to be a premium put [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=35.76s)]
*  on protecting civilians and making sure [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=37.8s)]
*  that humanitarian assistance can get to everyone who needs it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=39.32s)]
*  And as I said, I think the intent is there, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=42.64s)]
*  but the results are not always manifesting themselves. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=45.36s)]
*  And we see that both in terms of civilian protection [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=49.04s)]
*  and humanitarian assistance. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  We want to make sure that as Israel continues this campaign, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=52.5s)]
*  because remember, they are dealing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=56.16s)]
*  with a terrorist organization that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  engaged in the most vicious possible brutality on October [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  7th and has made clear that it would do it again, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=63.76s)]
*  and again, and again, if given the opportunity. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=67.16s)]
*  So Israel needs to be able to deal with this, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=69.2s)]
*  to protect itself, to prevent October 7th from happening [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=70.92s)]
*  again. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=73.16s)]
*  But as it does that, it's imperative [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=73.8s)]
*  that civilians be protected. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=76.32s)]
*  And here, the critical thing is to make sure [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=77.84s)]
*  that the military operations are designed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=80.44s)]
*  around civilian protection and to focus on that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=82.64s)]
*  When it comes to humanitarian assistance, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=85.26s)]
*  that we, as you know, made the argument many weeks ago [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  to get humanitarian assistance in, it started to flow. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=92.06s)]
*  We got it doubled during the humanitarian pause [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=94.74000000000001s)]
*  for the hostage releases that we helped to negotiate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=96.86s)]
*  But now what's critical is this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=99.46000000000001s)]
*  Even as Israel has taken additional steps, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=101.86000000000001s)]
*  for example, to designate safe areas in the South, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=104.06s)]
*  to focus on neighborhoods, not entire cities in terms [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=107.7s)]
*  of evacuating them, what we're not seeing sufficiently [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=110.98s)]
*  is a couple of things. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=114.06s)]
*  One, making sure that the humanitarian operators who [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=115.18s)]
*  are there, starting with the United Nations, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=118.78s)]
*  performing heroically, that there are de-confliction times, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  places, and routes so that the humanitarian can bring [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  the assistance that's getting into Gaza [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  to the people who need it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=129.62s)]
*  Similarly, we need to see the same kind of de-confliction, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=130.82s)]
*  time, pauses, designated routes, plural, not just one, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=134.34s)]
*  and clarity of communication so that people [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=140.10000000000002s)]
*  will know when it is safe and where it is safe to move [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=143.18s)]
*  to get out of harm's way before they go back home. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=145.9s)]
*  These are the kinds of things we're working on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=149.1s)]
*  every single day, again, to make sure that that gap [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=150.62s)]
*  between intent and result is as narrow as possible. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=152.9s)]
*  The IDF told CNN, I believe Alex Marquardt earlier today, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=156.06s)]
*  that they estimate they've killed about 7,000 Hamas fighters. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=159.22s)]
*  When do you anticipate this phase [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=164.34s)]
*  of Israel's military campaign is going to end? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=166.62s)]
*  Obviously, they can't kill every member of Hamas, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=169.3s)]
*  and even if they did, 150,000 new ones [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=172.1s)]
*  would show up the next day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=174.46s)]
*  Are the Israelis telling you anything about when [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=175.82s)]
*  this phase is going to wrap up? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=178.1s)]
*  Because obviously, the civilian death toll is mounting, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=179.38s)]
*  it's unimaginable. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  Secretary Austin suggested that Israel might ultimately [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  be facing a strategic defeat by chasing so many Palestinians [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=187.42s)]
*  into the arms of Hamas. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=191.5s)]
*  Jake, we have these discussions with Israel, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=195.78s)]
*  including about the duration, as well as how it's prosecuting, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=198.22s)]
*  this campaign against Hamas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=202.9s)]
*  These are decisions for Israel to make, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=204.98s)]
*  but Hamas has decisions to make, too. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=207.06s)]
*  It could get out from hiding behind civilians tomorrow. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  It could put down its arms tomorrow. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=213.57999999999998s)]
*  It could surrender tomorrow, and this would be over. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=215.42s)]
*  Right, obviously, but will the US continue to back Israel [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=218.62s)]
*  the way it's backing Israel right now, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=223.74s)]
*  if this continues for months and months, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=225.34s)]
*  as opposed to days or weeks? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=227.38s)]
*  Again, Israel has to make these decisions. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=230.42s)]
*  Of course, everyone wants to see this campaign come to a close [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=232.66s)]
*  as quickly as possible, but any country faced with what [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  Israel is facing, a terrorist organization that attacked it [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=240.42s)]
*  in the most horrific way possible on October 7th, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=243.66s)]
*  and as I said, has said repeatedly that it would do it [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=246.61999999999998s)]
*  again and again and again. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=249.14s)]
*  It has to get to the point where it is confident [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  that that can't be repeated, but you make another point [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=254.22s)]
*  that's very important. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=256.58s)]
*  When the major military operation is over, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=258.66s)]
*  this is not over, because we have to have a durable, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=262.62s)]
*  sustainable peace, and we have to make sure that we're [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  on the path to a durable and sustainable peace. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=270.14s)]
*  From our perspective, I think from the perspective [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=272.66s)]
*  of many around the world, that has to lead [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=274.98s)]
*  to a Palestinian state. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=278.42s)]
*  We're not going to have durable peace. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=280.38s)]
*  We're not gonna have durable security for Israel, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=281.86s)]
*  unless and until Palestinian political aspirations are met. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=284.70000000000005s)]
*  And of course, what happens the day after in Gaza itself, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=288.42s)]
*  once military operations, major military operations are over, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=292.70000000000005s)]
*  that's also usually important and urgent, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=295.54s)]
*  to make sure that governance, security, reconstruction, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  all of that is in place so that there's no vacuum. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=302.66s)]
*  The Committee to Protect Journalists says [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=305.38s)]
*  at least 63 journalists and members of the news media [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  have been killed, 56 of them Palestinian, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=310.14000000000004s)]
*  in this war, presumably mostly, if not entirely, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=315.1s)]
*  by IDF strikes. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=318.54s)]
*  Is that acceptable to you? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=320.3s)]
*  You've made press freedom a hallmark of your term. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=323.02s)]
*  How do you explain all these deaths of journalists? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=327.38s)]
*  How do the Israelis explain it? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=330.65999999999997s)]
*  Jake, as I see journalists, including some [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=335.21999999999997s)]
*  of your colleagues, but also from many other [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=337.94s)]
*  news organizations, putting their lives on the line [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=340.06s)]
*  to just bring the news, bring the facts, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=343.02s)]
*  bring information to the world, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=345.62s)]
*  I have extraordinary admiration for what they do, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=347.97999999999996s)]
*  for the courage that they show, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=352.18s)]
*  and for the vital importance of their mission. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=353.62s)]
*  And we wanna make sure that just as every civilian [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=356.46s)]
*  is protected to the greatest extent possible, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=359.78s)]
*  of course, journalists are too. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=361.82s)]
*  And when it comes to instances [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=364.58s)]
*  where journalists have been killed, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=367.97999999999996s)]
*  we wanna make sure that that's investigated [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=370.26s)]
*  and we understand what's happened, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=373.94s)]
*  and there's accountability. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=375.46s)]
*  Congress is scrambling to reach a deal to pass [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=378.3s)]
*  foreign aid for Ukraine and Israel. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  Republicans are insisting on more border funding [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=382.21999999999997s)]
*  and new asylum restrictions that that be added to the bill. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=385.5s)]
*  What would it mean for Ukraine and Israel [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=389.3s)]
*  if Congress does not pass any additional support [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=390.74s)]
*  by the end of the year, and why not agree [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=393.42s)]
*  to tougher border protections, which is an issue [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=395.7s)]
*  of national security as well? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=398.42s)]
*  Well, Jake, the border piece, as you know, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=400.94s)]
*  is out of my purview, but I can say this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=403.02s)]
*  I know on day one of this administration, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=405.74s)]
*  or at least day two, the president put before Congress, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=409.02s)]
*  I think, the first bill on immigration reform. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=411.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, Congress hasn't acted on that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=414.34s)]
*  In this request for additional funds, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=416.5s)]
*  there are $6 billion to enhance border security, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  including having more people, more agents on the border. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=423.86s)]
*  So I know that's very much part of the goal [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=427.06s)]
*  and very much part of the discussion [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=429.62s)]
*  and something the president's fully prepared to engage on. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=430.78s)]
*  But in terms of what it would mean for Ukraine, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=433.65999999999997s)]
*  what it would mean for Israel, what it would mean [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  for our efforts to be competitive in the Indo-Pacific, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=437.38s)]
*  I think the only people who'd be happy [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=441.58s)]
*  if the supplemental budget request is not voted on [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=443.5s)]
*  and approved by Congress are sitting in Moscow, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=446.65999999999997s)]
*  sitting in Tehran, sitting in Beijing. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=449.7s)]
*  For Ukraine, this is absolutely vital. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=452.26s)]
*  They've made remarkable progress over the last year [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  in pushing back Russian aggression, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=457.74s)]
*  taking back more than 50% of the territory [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=459.58s)]
*  that was seized since February of 2022. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=461.46s)]
*  But they're in a ferocious battle now [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=464.42s)]
*  in the South and the East. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=466.42s)]
*  We are running out of funding for them. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=467.74s)]
*  By the way, 90% of the assistance, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=470.18s)]
*  the security assistance that we've provided Ukraine [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=472.02s)]
*  is actually invested right here in the United States [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  to our companies, to our manufacturers. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=477.14s)]
*  Similarly, we've had extraordinary burden sharing [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=479.34s)]
*  with our allies and partners. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=482.02s)]
*  We've provided very significant assistance, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=483.09999999999997s)]
*  about $70 billion over the last two years. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=485.46000000000004s)]
*  Our European friends and partners beyond Europe, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=487.98s)]
*  more than $110 billion for Ukraine. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=491.18s)]
*  So we have the burden sharing that we need. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=493.5s)]
*  This is a time to really step up [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=496.5s)]
*  because if we don't, we know what happens. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=498.1s)]
*  Putin will be able to move forward with impunity [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=501.34000000000003s)]
*  and we know he won't stop in Ukraine [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=504.42s)]
*  and he may well end up going after a NATO country. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=507.18s)]
*  That would bring us in given our obligations [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=509.46000000000004s)]
*  to our NATO allies. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=511.34000000000003s)]
*  So here, an ounce of prevention [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=512.54s)]
*  is really worth 10 pounds a cure. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=515.2199999999999s)]
*  Anthony, as you know, CNN has led the coverage [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=517.78s)]
*  when it comes to the evidence mounting in Israel [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=520.2199999999999s)]
*  of rapes and sex crimes committed by Hamas [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=523.98s)]
*  against women and girls, maybe even against men [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=527.62s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=530.2199999999999s)]
*  Why do you think the United Nations [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=531.5799999999999s)]
*  and the international community has been so slow [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=533.3s)]
*  to condemn these atrocities? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=536.26s)]
*  I can't think of a real reason. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=538.38s)]
*  Well, let me just put it this way. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=541.26s)]
*  I've heard anti-Semitism hypothesized as a reason [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=542.74s)]
*  why the UN and the international community [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=546.5s)]
*  might be so slow to acknowledge this. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=548.8199999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=552.02s)]
*  Jake, first, I really applaud the extraordinary work of CNN [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=554.78s)]
*  in bringing this to light and bringing this before the world. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=558.8199999999999s)]
*  You've performed a remarkable service in doing that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=562.58s)]
*  As to your question, I don't have an answer. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=565.1s)]
*  I don't know why countries, leaders, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=567.3399999999999s)]
*  international organizations were so slow to focus on this, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=572.2199999999999s)]
*  to bring it to people's attention. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=576.26s)]
*  I'm glad it's finally happened. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=577.78s)]
*  The atrocities that we saw on October 7th [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=578.9799999999999s)]
*  are almost beyond human description [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=581.9399999999999s)]
*  or beyond our capacity to digest. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=584.0999999999999s)]
*  And we've talked about them before, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=586.26s)]
*  but the sexual violence that we saw on October 7th [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=587.9399999999999s)]
*  is beyond anything that I've seen either. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=593.6600000000001s)]
*  So thank you for doing that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=598.22s)]
*  And look, I don't have a good answer to that question. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=599.98s)]
*  I think it's a question that these organizations, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=602.0600000000001s)]
*  these countries need to ask themselves. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=605.7800000000001s)]
*  Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=608.86s)]
*  thanks for joining us today. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=609.98s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=610.82s)]
*  Thanks, Jake. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=613.58s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTg_4VZpNTc&t=614.4200000000001s)]
