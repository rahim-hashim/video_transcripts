# Explosion heard in Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk)
*  We're following more breaking news into CNN this out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=0.0s)]
*  According to a Hezbollah run TV agency, a loud explosion has been heard in the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  southern suburbs of Beirut. Let's take you there live with CNN's Ben Weidemann. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=8.2s)]
*  Ben, what more are you learning about this explosion? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Of course, we know that within the last half hour there was a large explosion [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=19.8s)]
*  in what's known as the Harat Haraik neighborhood of southern Beirut. That's [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=23.56s)]
*  an area where many of the leaders of Hezbollah have been known to operate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=27.8s)]
*  Now, we don't have a lot of details. We know that some local channels are saying [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=34.88s)]
*  that the one of the building hit was a residential building. We don't know [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=40.96s)]
*  about casualties at this point. It still seems to be a fairly chaotic scene. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  We have seen pictures of smoke rising from that part of the city, but certainly [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=53.4s)]
*  that is what we know at this point. It is the first time the southern suburbs [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=61.36s)]
*  of Beirut have been hit since early January when the Israelis killed a senior [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=68.36s)]
*  Hamas leader who was in that area. But as I said, this is the first strike since [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=74.52s)]
*  then and Hezbollah has made it very clear all along that if Beirut is struck, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=81.04s)]
*  they will answer accordingly. They have said that they will meet escalation [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=87.28s)]
*  with escalation in the aftermath of last Saturday's attack on the Golan, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli occupied Syrian Golan Heights that left 12 children dead. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  So perhaps this is the first major Israeli response to that attack. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  And Ben, just to be clear, when you're saying this happened in the Beirut suburbs, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=110.48s)]
*  can you give us some specificity on what Hezbollah might see as an attack, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  maybe Beirut proper versus in the suburbs? Will this matter? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=124.64s)]
*  Well, we call it, it's called the Beirut suburbs, the Al Dahya in Arabic, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  but it really is part of the city of Beirut. It's between where I am down by the port and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=135.8s)]
*  the airport. So it really is Beirut proper despite what we call it. And of course, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  that has been made clear time and time again by Hezbollah that that's a red line. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=151.24s)]
*  Now, just the other day, I spoke with the foreign minister of Lebanon who told me that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=157.12s)]
*  they through diplomatic channels, they had received assurances from their friends, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=162.56s)]
*  he called them, that Beirut, that the Israeli response would be limited. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  And the Lebanese government interpreted that as meaning that Beirut, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=174.2s)]
*  the southern suburbs of Beirut and the airport would not be targeted. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=179.32s)]
*  That perhaps was not a very correct interpretation of those so-called assurances. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=184.12s)]
*  Ben, please stand by for us in Beirut. We want to bring in CNN military analyst, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=191.8s)]
*  former General Mark Hurtling, who is joining us now live. General, thank you so much for being [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=197.08s)]
*  with us. Walk us through the significance of these explosions happening in Beirut and [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=201.6s)]
*  specifically, what would give you evidence or what would suggest to you that this was in fact, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=207.04s)]
*  an IDF led attack? We have nothing that leads to that just yet, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=213.08s)]
*  Boris. It's the possibility of an IDF attack. Usually, it's not done this early in the evening [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=220.08s)]
*  after sunset. The IDF usually waits until the later hours of the evening where they can assure [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  that there's no collateral damage on civilian casualties when they conduct a strike. But when [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=233.24s)]
*  you're talking about explosions, you don't really know where they come from. And again, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  I would suggest because this is Lebanon, this is Beirut, that there is the potential for other [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=242.32000000000002s)]
*  types of explosion in this area. So you can't conclude anything just yet. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=248.68s)]
*  General, I do want to stop you there because Israel is now claiming responsibility for this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=253.24s)]
*  strike in southern Beirut. So obviously, that's important information and changes your calculus [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=259.52s)]
*  of how you're seeing this. Explain the significance now that we know that. We just literally got that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=265.16s)]
*  in the Israeli military saying that it carried out a targeted strike in southern Beirut. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=269.56s)]
*  Well, Brianna, thanks for being the scout on the screen line right there. As soon as you've [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=273.96s)]
*  confirmed it, then you can talk about it a whole lot differently. The thing that I was about to say, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  Ben's reporting about promises of not striking or having limited strikes doesn't necessarily [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=284.08s)]
*  mean they're not going to strike in Beirut. There are areas there within and around the capital [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=291.24s)]
*  where Hezbollah has centers. Let's just call them that. Anything from cells to intelligence centers [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=296.52s)]
*  to military command structures in and around the area of Beirut, they've always had that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=303.28s)]
*  So when you're talking about the potential to limit that and not go near the capital area or [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  near the airport, I just find that a little bit of hyperbole from the standpoint of someone [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=314.0s)]
*  hoping for the best that this wouldn't happen. So if it is, and I'll say one more thing, if it's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  just a couple of explosions as has been reported, two explosions, that is a proportional response [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=327.72s)]
*  so far. It could get bigger, but when you're talking about what happened the other day with [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=335.24s)]
*  the killing of civilians and especially children in that playground or that soccer field, you're [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=341.04s)]
*  talking about the potential for a much greater response by Israel. And again, this could just be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=347.48s)]
*  But this is a proportional response not only against Hezbollah, but against, it's a signal to the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=353.8s)]
*  Lebanese government of get control of these terrorists that are living among you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=360.56s)]
*  And I want to read and paraphrase a portion of the statement that we just got from the IDF taking [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=365.24s)]
*  responsibility. It says, quote, the IDF carried out a targeted strike in Beirut on the commander [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  responsible for the murder of the children in the Golan Heights and the killing of numerous additional [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=375.52s)]
*  Israeli civilians. General, I think the concern has been going back to October 7th of a wider [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=380.72s)]
*  regional conflict. The United States has repeatedly warned Israel about any potential attacks going [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=388.0s)]
*  into Beirut specifically. But we heard John Kirby, the spokesperson for the NSC recently say that [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=395.92s)]
*  concerns about a wider conflict based on an Israeli response are exaggerated. How do you see [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=403.36s)]
*  where the conflict stands now versus what this could potentially lead up to? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=409.44s)]
*  You know, there were a couple of actions for us, and you're exactly right. John Kirby did say all [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=415.92s)]
*  those things. And I think it was as a warning to all that an Israeli attack into southern Lebanon, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=420.64s)]
*  a ground attack, as it were, or an extensive air campaign in Lebanon would be significant and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=428.0s)]
*  it would not be to Israel's advantage because it would open up a second front while they're [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  continuing with their actions in Gaza. But truthfully, Israel has to respond to that kind [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  of attack from Lebanon. So again, a proportional response versus a ground incursion of southern [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=447.84s)]
*  Lebanon are either a massive air strike or an air campaign against various targets inside of Lebanon. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  And again, it's early yet. That could occur. More strikes could be conducted. But this is a signal [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=461.36s)]
*  if the Israeli government and the Israeli defense forces say it was a kinetic strike against an [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  identified target of an individual that conducted the command and control of that strike into [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel a few days ago. I think we're seeing a good thing. It's something that I was talking [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=480.72s)]
*  to CNN on Saturday saying it would be devastating for Israel to open a second front with a major [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=487.76s)]
*  ground incursion or a massive air campaign. And it appears at least so far that they've limited [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=493.84s)]
*  their strikes to specifically the target that was the commander of the strike that occurred the other [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  day. Yeah. General, if you could stand by for us, we'll come back to you. I do want to bring in [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=506.56s)]
*  Colorado Congressman Jason Crowe, who we had stick around with us as we got word of this news. He's [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=511.2s)]
*  a former Army Ranger. He's also on the House Foreign Affairs and Intel committees. As we get word of [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=515.92s)]
*  this targeted strike, Israel says Israeli military says on this Hezbollah commander that they say [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=520.64s)]
*  was behind this attack that killed 12 children in northern Israel. What are you? What are your [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  thoughts as you see this news? Well, Israel absolutely has a right and I'd even say an [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  obligation to respond to this attack that killed 12 children by Hezbollah. But why we talk about [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=536.8s)]
*  issues of proportionality is that it goes directly to the concern about escalation. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=542.8s)]
*  And I'm not talking about why escalation in this case is a larger concern than maybe it has been [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=547.5999999999999s)]
*  in the past. What we have to do is we have to zoom out and talk about Iran. Iran works through these [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=553.28s)]
*  regional proxies, these proxy forces, right? Hamas is one of them. Hezbollah is one of them. The [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=559.92s)]
*  Houthis, they have other militias and forces throughout the Middle East. But Hezbollah is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=565.3599999999999s)]
*  the largest and the most capable of all of those proxy forces, right? So the concern about [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=569.92s)]
*  escalation is the most acute when we're talking about Hezbollah, right? The thing that could [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=575.4399999999999s)]
*  lead to a larger regional war is if Hezbollah opens up a northern front. They have far more [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=580.7199999999999s)]
*  rockets, far more personnel, far more sophisticated weaponry and more capability across the board. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=585.92s)]
*  And that could be very devastating in the north. And Hezbollah has vowed that depending on the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=592.0s)]
*  Israeli response, they wouldn't go to war with Israel alone. To your point, it would be these [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=596.48s)]
*  Iranian back groups. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMsMa37UPk&t=600.72s)]
