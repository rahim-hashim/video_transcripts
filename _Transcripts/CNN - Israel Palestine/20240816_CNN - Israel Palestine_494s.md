# Israeli settlers attack West Bank village, drawing condemnation from top officials
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs)
*  A second day of talks in Doha over a potential Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=0.0s)]
*  now ended. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=4.66s)]
*  CNN is told that technical teams will continue to meet in the coming days until the main [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=5.66s)]
*  principals meet again in Cairo next week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=9.66s)]
*  This comes as the Israeli military orders evacuations from parts of the so-called humanitarian [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  zone in southern Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=17.12s)]
*  Israel says that it has intelligence that terrorist activity is taking place there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=19.2s)]
*  Since October of last year, more than 80 percent of the Gaza Strip has been subjected to evacuation [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=23.18s)]
*  orders. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=27.92s)]
*  Just according to the UN's humanitarian agency. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=29.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank has come under attack by armed Israeli [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=31.6s)]
*  settlers. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=36.96s)]
*  Nick Robertson is tracking this story for us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=37.96s)]
*  Well, the car behind was set on fire as the settlers came into this hilltop village. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=40.64s)]
*  The man who owns the car, I'm talking to him, his face is smashed up. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=47.08s)]
*  He said he tried to confront the settlers as they came in. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=50.6s)]
*  He described a scenario that they haven't witnessed in this particular village for a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=53.32s)]
*  long time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  And he said never before, in fact, have they ever seen armed settlers coming in, firing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  live rounds, firing tear gas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=64.16s)]
*  And when we arrived in the town here a little earlier on in the day, we were witness to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=66.52s)]
*  the funeral cortege of Rashid Seder, a 23-year-old young man who was shot dead by the settlers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=70.6s)]
*  There was a lot of anger in that cortege at the settlers, at the Israeli government, a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=77.62s)]
*  lot of pain being felt. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=83.2s)]
*  This was a young man of the village. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=84.98s)]
*  He was being carried at shoulder height, wrapped in a Palestinian flag, young men carrying [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=87.22s)]
*  him, older men watching from the sides. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=93.42s)]
*  And at the funeral service in the graveyard a little after, the oration there was absolutely [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=95.82s)]
*  powerful and very clear in its message that the people of this village don't feel safe, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=102.06s)]
*  that they believe that the settlers were acting with the support of the Israeli government. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=109.58s)]
*  They don't feel in this village protected by the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=114.44s)]
*  In fact, they allege that the Israeli Defense Force was protecting the settlers. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  Now, the IDF did stop a second attack overnight getting into this village. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=124.96s)]
*  The IDF and the Israeli police are investigating the incident so far. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=130.04s)]
*  We've heard condemnation coming from the U.S. ambassador, Jack Lusang, is absolutely appalled [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=134.84s)]
*  by this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=140.18s)]
*  And these attacks must stop. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=141.18s)]
*  The defense minister of Israel, Yoav Galant, has put his condemnation out as well, calling [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  it radical violence. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=149.64s)]
*  It does not, he said, does not stand up to the values of the state of Israel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=151.12s)]
*  Israel's interior minister has condemned it as well, calling it violent nationalist riots. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=156.64s)]
*  Those were his words. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=163.62s)]
*  So the condemnation coming from Israeli officials, even from right-wing leaders like Itamar Ben [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=164.76s)]
*  Although he did say that the Israeli Defense Force should do more to protect the settlers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=171.52s)]
*  And Israel is from the stone throwers, who he calls terrorists in these villages. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=176.84s)]
*  That's his allegation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  But he did say that this is absolutely unacceptable. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  So this is strong condemnation coming from Israeli officials. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=189.3s)]
*  But it just doesn't cut through in these villages. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=192.54000000000002s)]
*  People here don't feel safe. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=195.6s)]
*  And I think irrespective of what they hear from the Israeli government, they will continue [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=198.48s)]
*  to believe that events like last night, the settlers coming in armed in the village where [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=202.6s)]
*  no one was expecting, killing a young man, injuring others, they think these are coordinated [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=208.48s)]
*  by the government. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=214.88s)]
*  They're in cahoots together. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=216.16s)]
*  This is deeply divisive, particularly at the time of these very sensitive talks in Doha [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=217.86s)]
*  about the future of Gaza going on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  Nick Robinson, CNN, JIT, and the Occupied West Bank. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=229.79999999999998s)]
*  Joining us now from Washington, D.C. is our chief national security correspondent, Alex [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Marquardt. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  Alex, good to see you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's circle back to the ceasefire talks. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  What more do we know about how these talks ended and also what progress was made, if [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=239.04s)]
*  any? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=244.12s)]
*  Well, they ended on a positive note. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=245.12s)]
*  And the fact that we know that more meetings are going to be happening in the coming days, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=247.73999999999998s)]
*  that is positive. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  But by no means are we on the cusp of any kind of imminent deal, Rahel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=253.72s)]
*  That is important. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=257.36s)]
*  These main mediators, so the heads of intelligence for Egypt and the U.S., as well as the Qatari [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=258.68s)]
*  prime minister, they went into these talks with the Israelis, with Hamas, trying to bridge [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=263.08s)]
*  some pretty significant gaps. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=268.32s)]
*  And what we heard today from those three mediating countries in a joint statement was that they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  made progress by putting forward what they're calling a bridging proposal, essentially a [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=274.58s)]
*  document that takes all of the outstanding issues and tries to bring the two sides closer [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=279.88s)]
*  together in terms of how those issues will not only be solved, but how they will be implemented. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=284.8s)]
*  So what we're told is that in the coming days, now that these main talks are over in Doha, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=290.64s)]
*  at a lower level, experts on what are called technical teams will get together to essentially [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=296.08s)]
*  cross the T's, dot the I's, and really work towards a final agreement. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=301.08s)]
*  And then towards the end of next week, the main players again will get back together [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=305.76s)]
*  in the Egyptian capital, Cairo. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=310.24s)]
*  So we're talking about the CIA director, Bill Burns, the Egyptian intelligence director, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=311.84s)]
*  Abbas Kamal, the Qatari prime minister, the Israeli head of the Mossad intelligence agency, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  and Hamas. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=322.56s)]
*  And so these are encouraging signs, but no one that I've spoken to, Rahel, is ready to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=323.56s)]
*  say that this is certainly something that is going to happen. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=327.8s)]
*  I want to read you part of the joint statement that was released just a short time ago from [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=330.28s)]
*  the three mediating countries. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=334.2s)]
*  It says, it is time to release the hostages and detainees, begin the ceasefire, and implement [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=335.56s)]
*  this agreement. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=341.32s)]
*  The path is now set for that outcome, saving lives, bringing relief to the people of Gaza, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=342.36s)]
*  and de-escalating regional tensions. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=347.68s)]
*  One more note, Rahel, this comes as the prospect of a major strike or major strikes from Hezbollah [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=351.42s)]
*  and Iran could happen against Israel, retaliatory strikes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=358.76s)]
*  And so what the ceasefire talks, those involved, are hoping to accomplish is essentially to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=363.4s)]
*  push those potential strikes away, to keep them at bay. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  And in fact, the Qatari prime minister has reached out to the Iranian foreign minister [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=373.64s)]
*  not once, but twice in the past two days to keep him abreast of the talks and to say that [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  essentially that they need to give these ceasefire discussions a chance and that any kind of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=383.4s)]
*  escalatory action, a major strike, could derail the prospect for peace in Gaza. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=388.6s)]
*  Rahel? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=395.44s)]
*  And Alex, to that end, Israel is saying and telling its counterparts in the UK and France [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=396.44s)]
*  that it expects their nations, the UK and France, to attack Iran if Iran strikes Israel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=401.36s)]
*  One, where do those nations stand on that? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  But also, where does the U.S. stand on this? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=409.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, the U.S. is essentially helping coordinate that effort. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  And let's remind our viewers why we expect this to happen. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=415.4s)]
*  Several weeks ago, there were a pair of strikes that Israel is either publicly behind or is [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  believed to have been behind. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  One was against a major figure in the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, Ford Shakir. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=425.84s)]
*  He was killed in an airstrike in southern Beirut by Israel. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=430.23999999999995s)]
*  The next day, there was an operation that took out the top political leader for Hamas [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=433.2s)]
*  in the Iranian capital. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=437.84s)]
*  Israel did not admit that they carried that out, but it is widely believed that they did. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=439.44s)]
*  And so now we're in a situation where it is believed that Hezbollah and or Iran could [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=443.38s)]
*  respond. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=448.46s)]
*  Now, it's been several weeks, so we've been waiting to see every single day whether this [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=449.46s)]
*  is going to happen. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=452.9s)]
*  In the meantime, the U.S. has been assuring Israel that it will come to its defense. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=454.21999999999997s)]
*  It is expected that the Brits and the French would also help in that defense. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=458.5s)]
*  And the major reasons are, Rahel, not just because they want to protect Israel, but if [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=463.06s)]
*  there were major damage and a lot of deaths in Israel as a result of those strikes, we [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=467.58s)]
*  could expect the situation to really escalate and potentially spiral out of control. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=471.78s)]
*  So the U.S. and potentially with the Brits and the French are really trying to avoid [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=476.21999999999997s)]
*  that scenario. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=482.17999999999995s)]
*  But right now we are waiting and seeing whether Hezbollah and Iran could carry out those kinds [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=483.84s)]
*  of strikes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=489.46s)]
*  Rahel. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=490.46s)]
*  We continue to watch. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=491.46s)]
*  Alex Marquardt, thank you for your reporting. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZESvtqhfqs&t=492.46s)]
