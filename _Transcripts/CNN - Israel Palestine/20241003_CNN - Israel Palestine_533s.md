# About 100 projectiles launched from Lebanon into Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU)
*  More breaking news this hour, another Israeli airstrike hitting southern Beirut just a short [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=0.0s)]
*  time ago. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=4.12s)]
*  This is the first video that we're actually getting of the new explosion. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=5.12s)]
*  It follows another barrage of daytime strikes in those southern suburbs. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=8.96s)]
*  Now, that was after a round of strikes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=13.88s)]
*  Israel's military said it was targeting Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters and communications [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=16.76s)]
*  unit. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=21.32s)]
*  The U.S. has repeatedly called for de-escalation, but so far, as you can see, that has fallen [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=22.32s)]
*  on deaf ears. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=26.92s)]
*  John Liptak is live for us at the White House. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=27.92s)]
*  Natasha Bertrand joins us from the Pentagon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=30.0s)]
*  Kevin, I want to go to you first. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  The president was off to see some of the damage from Hurricane Helene recently. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=33.88s)]
*  He was on the lawn and indicated that they were, quote, talking about it in terms of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=38.56s)]
*  a strike in Iran, and that had to do with hitting its oil facilities. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  As we are looking at this unfold, what more is the White House saying? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Because they continue to call for de-escalation, but it's in weeks now that all we've seen [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I think what the White House is looking for now is a measured response from [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=57.6s)]
*  Israel towards Iran as a reprisal for what happened in Israel over the last week or so. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=62.4s)]
*  But I think there's an open question of how much leverage President Biden has when he's [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=69.92s)]
*  talking to the Israelis about how they want to respond. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=74.8s)]
*  We did hear from him yesterday when he was asked about an Israeli strike on nuclear sites [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=77.96s)]
*  inside Iran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=83.16s)]
*  He said he could not support that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=84.32s)]
*  He would advise against it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=86.22s)]
*  But when he was asked today about those oil facilities, he did leave the door open, although [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=87.42s)]
*  he didn't come out explicitly and say that he would endorse that kind of strike. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=92.62s)]
*  And as you would imagine, that kind of strike would only cause oil prices to spike. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=97.18s)]
*  That is the last thing President Biden wants five weeks before an election. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=102.3s)]
*  So this is all very complicated for him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=105.66s)]
*  And I think when you talk to American officials, they are in consultations with the Israelis [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=108.02s)]
*  talking about how they see this all playing out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=113.02000000000001s)]
*  But certainly, President Biden hasn't yet gotten on the phone with his counterpart, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=116.78s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=120.34s)]
*  They actually haven't spoken since August. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=121.54s)]
*  And I think it is an open question about how much leverage President Biden actually has [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=124.72s)]
*  in all of this or whether he's left sort of on the sidelines to watch this all play out. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=129.66s)]
*  At the bottom or at the end of the day, his great fear is that this will all trigger a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=135.04s)]
*  wider war, a regional war, a further escalation that could potentially draw the U.S. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=139.86s)]
*  closer into contact, direct contact with Iran, which is really sort of the last thing he [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=146.46s)]
*  wants. And so certainly, President Biden watching this all very closely. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=152.18s)]
*  The other thing that he said today was that there would be new sanctions on Iran. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=155.78s)]
*  And that's something that he and the other leaders of the G7 had been talking about [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=160.38s)]
*  yesterday in that virtual phone call. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=164.78s)]
*  It remains to be seen what exactly those sanctions will look like and how much effect [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=166.9s)]
*  they will have. The U.S., of course, has already mounted a lot of sanctions on Iran [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=171.82000000000002s)]
*  already. So it remains to be seen what areas they think they can still target and have [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=176.78s)]
*  a great amount of effect. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=181.82000000000002s)]
*  But President Biden watching this very closely, he also said today that he didn't expect [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=183.18s)]
*  this counterstrike to occur today during the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=188.46s)]
*  But certainly they do believe that this could occur in the coming days. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=192.98s)]
*  Yeah, a startling fact there that you give us that Netanyahu and President Biden have [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=196.66s)]
*  not spoken since August. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=202.46s)]
*  That is extraordinary. Although, of course, the two governments are keeping in close [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=204.14s)]
*  contact. Natasha Bertrand of the Pentagon, I want to go to you now. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=207.85999999999999s)]
*  I do want to highlight the fact that the IDF is now reporting that about 100 launches [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=211.22s)]
*  have come from Lebanon into northern Israel in just the last few hours. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=216.46s)]
*  I do note they say that most of them are along the Matula area in that border area. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=221.86s)]
*  I've been to that area. We are not talking about anything that's crossing deep into [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  Israel. Having said that, Natasha, what more are you hearing given the fact that the United [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=229.86s)]
*  States has obviously bolstered any of its defenses and any of the military hardware [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=234.34s)]
*  and advice that it can give to Israel and really repositioned a lot of assets there [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=239.70000000000002s)]
*  in the last few weeks in anticipation of this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=245.94000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and that's exactly why the US military has bolstered its force posture in the region [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=249.22s)]
*  is because of the risk of further dramatic escalation in this fighting. Now, we reported [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=253.7s)]
*  yesterday that the US intelligence community does believe that around 50 percent of Hezbollah's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=260.18s)]
*  projectiles have been taken out in these Israeli airstrikes, leaving them with half of the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=266.02s)]
*  supply that they once had of things like rockets and missiles and drones. And so that has severely [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=272.34s)]
*  weakened their capabilities here. But as we can see, you know, they have continued striking [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=277.7s)]
*  back. And we saw that, you know, eight IDF soldiers were killed just yesterday in the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=281.94s)]
*  fighting in Lebanon. And so what the US military is preparing for here is really a conflict [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=287.38s)]
*  that escalates even further than just Israel and Lebanon and actually expands into that [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=293.62s)]
*  war with Iran. And that is what everyone is waiting to see at this point. If the escalating [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  tit for tat between Israel and Iran actually continues and draws everyone into this large [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=303.38s)]
*  regional war, the US has warships pretty much all over at this point in the eastern Mediterranean, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=308.74s)]
*  in the Red Sea, in the Arabian Sea, near Iran to prepare for the possibility that they have to, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=313.78s)]
*  again, be intercepting these missiles. And, of course, one of the biggest jobs of the US [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=318.9s)]
*  military, if it comes to it, is to help evacuate US citizens. And that is why there are thousands [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=324.74s)]
*  of US Marines currently in the eastern Mediterranean preparing for that exact contingency if it becomes [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=329.94s)]
*  necessary for the US to conduct this kind of mass evacuation operation. But for now, there are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=335.62s)]
*  simply thousands of US troops that are currently in the region, essentially on a heightened standby [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=340.42s)]
*  alerts to come to the aid of Israel if need be by helping them with additional air defenses, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=346.18s)]
*  and, of course, to help defend the many other US troops who are in other parts of the region, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=352.74s)]
*  including Jordan, Iraq, Syria, who could be vulnerable to attack by Iran's additional proxy [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=358.26s)]
*  groups. Yeah, a lot to think about. And as we point out, the Pentagon are getting ready for all [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=364.5s)]
*  eventualities. Kevin, back to you at the White House. There has been a lot of criticism of the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=369.46s)]
*  Biden policy here and whether or not they could have done more, should have done more. There is a [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=373.78s)]
*  debate whether they could have done anything to influence Israel on any level. You know, I am [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=377.78s)]
*  watching the price of oil. It's up nearly 5% today. How front of mind is the election right [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=383.3s)]
*  now and the fact that Americans may be very unsettled looking at their screens right now [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=389.78000000000003s)]
*  and wondering what impact it will have on their lives and on their military? Yeah, I think we can [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  safely say that there's nothing that Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, wants less than a full [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  regional war in the Middle East breaking out in the weeks before the election because, of course, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=405.3s)]
*  it will amount to a referendum on the Biden-Harris administration, that they were unable to contain [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=410.18s)]
*  this conflict to Gaza, that they weren't able to use whatever leverage that they had on the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=416.58s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza and to lower the temperatures across the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=421.86s)]
*  region. And certainly when you talk to White House officials, they do say that they have tried to, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=426.98s)]
*  you know, put the finger on Netanyahu to try and get him to ease up in Gaza, to try and come to a [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=432.82s)]
*  ceasefire agreement both in Gaza and on the Israel-Lebanon border. But, you know, certainly [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=439.62s)]
*  Netanyahu himself also is aware that an election is coming in the United States. And there is a [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=445.46s)]
*  sense among White House officials, you know, at their most frustrated moments, who wonder whether [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=451.7s)]
*  Netanyahu, who knows that he has a very staunch ally in Donald Trump, could be trying to sort of, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=457.46s)]
*  you know, make this, make conditions ripe for a Republican victory in November. Now, I think the [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=463.3s)]
*  Israelis would vehemently deny that, but it is a question that you hear administration officials [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=469.06s)]
*  asking. The other sort of aspect to this is that the election makes it very difficult, I think, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=474.26s)]
*  for Democrats to come out and forcefully criticize Netanyahu and forcefully criticize Israel, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=479.54s)]
*  particularly at a moment when it is under attack from Iran. And they wonder whether Netanyahu could [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=485.22s)]
*  see this opening to really do something quite forceful in Iran, knowing that he wouldn't [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=491.22s)]
*  necessarily get much pushback from the current administration because of its political sort of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=496.18s)]
*  bind that it's in. So this is all a very complicated dynamic. But I think, you know, for Harris and for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=501.86s)]
*  Biden, they are aware that this is a situation that looks like it could tip out of control [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=507.7s)]
*  very easily. They very much want to not do that, to contain it, to try and end the fighting and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=512.82s)]
*  end the violence. But at this point, it's not very clear how they will go about doing that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=519.62s)]
*  Okay. And again, as you said, just a little over a month to an election in the United States. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=524.4200000000001s)]
*  Kevin Libtak for us from the White House and Tasha Bertran at the Pentagon. Appreciate it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9QUmLV30tU&t=529.0600000000001s)]
