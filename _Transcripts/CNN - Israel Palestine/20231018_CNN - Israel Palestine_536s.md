# Military analyst breaks down Israeli evidence in Gaza hospital blast
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM)
*  And for a closer look at what we do know and what we don't about this blast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to bring in CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling here. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=3.84s)]
*  General, look, we have some video here, and I want you to just take a look at this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=8.56s)]
*  This is some footage that seems to show a rocket going up here, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=13.6s)]
*  and then something happens that's pretty catastrophic. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=20.48s)]
*  When you see this, what do you see? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=23.36s)]
*  I see a flame out of a rocket, and we've been talking about this all day, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=26.4s)]
*  and it's a result of what happened yesterday. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  But when you see that rocket going forward, this happens a lot with these kind of rockets [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=34.48s)]
*  that are supplied by Iran, it is a rocket motor that doesn't work. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=39.44s)]
*  It gets a certain distance, and then it just flames out, and a rocket has a trajectory of a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=45.36s)]
*  brick once it doesn't have a force behind it, so it immediately drops. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=50.72s)]
*  So you see it right there, flame out, so it loses its rocket motor, and then it just drops down. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=54.8s)]
*  But what you also have when that happens is the fuel that's part of the rocket that hasn't burned. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  So when it hits the ground, we'll see next the explosion. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=70.88s)]
*  Here's the video of an explosion from a viewpoint from the ground. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=74.0s)]
*  Yeah, now this isn't a very big piece of ordinance, it's a relatively small ordinance, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=77.2s)]
*  so the actual explosive isn't that big, but what is big is the fuel that it hasn't used. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=81.92s)]
*  That caused a lot of cars in that parking lot to burn. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=90.16s)]
*  We see the after effects of that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=93.28s)]
*  We see a very small crater. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=95.44s)]
*  If it had been a crater from a... [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=97.52s)]
*  Let's actually take a look at what you're discussing here. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=98.56s)]
*  I'm going to just break this down a little bit more for folks. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=100.88s)]
*  What I'm showing you here, this is, to be clear, provided by the IDF. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=103.76s)]
*  This shows what looks like satellite imagery of the area where this rocket may have come down. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=108.24s)]
*  This is the explosion site. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  They're saying that if you look over here, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  this is what typically you would see if there was an IDF strike, even as large as 19 meters, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=120.72s)]
*  a much larger crater. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=126.16s)]
*  It doesn't seem like we see that here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=128.56s)]
*  We also have some before and after images here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=132.0s)]
*  This is the hospital, the Al Ali Hospital. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=134.16s)]
*  This is the explosion site in this area here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=137.04s)]
*  And here it is after. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=142.0s)]
*  So you were just discussing the size of the crater. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=143.92s)]
*  We don't... [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=146.0s)]
*  Some of the images are not super clear whether there was a crater or not. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=146.72s)]
*  But when you look at this, this is up close at the cars and the site of the fire. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=150.72s)]
*  What do you see? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=154.16s)]
*  What I saw earlier today was a photo of a very small crater about right there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=154.88s)]
*  What you see in this area are a lot of burned cars. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=161.84s)]
*  What you see over here are cars that are not burned. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=165.6s)]
*  What you see across at this building, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=168.88s)]
*  if you had a picture of the building, which I think we do... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=170.72s)]
*  No, I'm sorry. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=175.04s)]
*  We don't have enough close to the building, but we do have these... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=175.92s)]
*  What we do see is pock marks on the side of the building. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=178.0s)]
*  You can look at this video here and it shows some of the aftermath on the buildings. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=181.04s)]
*  And it will show up here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=182.96s)]
*  You see the burned car, but as the camera scans over here, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=183.84s)]
*  you'll see cars that aren't burned. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=187.12s)]
*  Very close. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=189.6s)]
*  So it had an effect of the explosive capability of a rocket, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=190.64s)]
*  which is relatively small, but a lot of fuel blowing up after it [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=194.56s)]
*  that didn't burn off the rocket motor. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=198.56s)]
*  So this is evidence of certainly not a bomb that would come off of an aircraft. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=200.72s)]
*  You see the pock marks, the blown out windows, but not a whole lot else. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=208.0s)]
*  I mean, there's not a whole lot of damages to the building. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=212.0s)]
*  Now, the doctors inside of the building said that there were patients that were injured. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  That could have been from the blast glass flying inside of the building, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  but it certainly wasn't a strike on the hospital itself. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=222.8s)]
*  And just briefly, if you were to have seen a strike, a true strike coming from Israel, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  I want to also just, as I'm saying, to show you this is an image that shows, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=232.48000000000002s)]
*  according to the IDF, the trajectory of this rocket. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  And it comes from somewhere inside of northern Gaza, and it goes this direction. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=241.52s)]
*  It goes east. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=248.08s)]
*  What you have here is something called a point of origin. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=249.28s)]
*  That's where the rocket was fired from, right where that red dot is. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=253.2s)]
*  You see multiple tracers coming off of those. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=256.88s)]
*  Those are the different rockets that come out of that rocket pod. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=259.52s)]
*  The one that came out right here came out over the hospital. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=262.96s)]
*  And I believe that that was the one that lost its engine [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=267.04s)]
*  and fell on close to the hospital, not on the hospital. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=271.28s)]
*  So this is part of the proof that the Israeli Defense Forces gave. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=274.56s)]
*  They said, hey, this is something called a Q-36 radar. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=277.84s)]
*  They used these radars to connect with the Iron Dome to shoot down rockets. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=281.28s)]
*  So when you see all these coming off of a missile site [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  and one dropping over the top of a hospital, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=289.67999999999995s)]
*  you can see where it was truthfully an accident, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=292.4s)]
*  a missile that didn't go through to its final mission. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=295.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  And as you've pointed out many times, these Iranian-provided missiles, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=300.23999999999995s)]
*  they tend to do that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=305.2s)]
*  General Mark Hurtling, thank you very much for breaking all of that down for us. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=306.32s)]
*  And President Biden, reflecting on the difficult decisions ahead for Israel's leaders, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=309.68s)]
*  here is part of what he said. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=314.56s)]
*  I made wartime decisions. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=317.92s)]
*  I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=319.44s)]
*  There's always cost, but it requires being deliberate. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  It requires asking very hard questions. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=328.24s)]
*  It requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=331.52s)]
*  About whether the path you're on will achieve those objectives. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=336.48s)]
*  The vast majority of Palestinians are not Hamas. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=340.8s)]
*  Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=345.04s)]
*  I want to bring in now Aviv Ezra, a senior Israeli diplomat [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=350.0s)]
*  at the New York Consulate and a former Consul General in Chicago. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=353.6s)]
*  Aviv, thank you for being here. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=357.44s)]
*  This incident has had real ripple effects. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=359.44s)]
*  Putting aside for a moment any dispute about who's responsible and who's not, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  we just broke that down. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=367.12s)]
*  Has it altered Israel's plans for a ground invasion of Gaza? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=368.72s)]
*  Well, the way we see it, this is actually a triple war crime. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=373.04s)]
*  On the one hand, they're sending missiles from population areas in Gaza. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  They're shooting at population innocent civilians in Israel. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  And thirdly, when they misfire, they hit their own population in the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=384.24s)]
*  So for us, this is not only a triple war crime, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=388.88s)]
*  it is something that later on took a life of its own into the conversation of who is in charge. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=391.91999999999996s)]
*  And the fake news that came out of it with the entire conversation last 24 hours ago [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=397.76s)]
*  created a situation where Israel was guilty before we can... [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=402.0s)]
*  But I'm sure you can imagine that that is likely to happen here. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=406.23999999999995s)]
*  Does the fallout from this, even if it's as a result of misinformation, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=409.52s)]
*  change the calculus for Israel as it tries to decide [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=415.76s)]
*  what happens if there is a ground invasion [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=419.84s)]
*  and whether that is something that can be done or should be done right now? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, for Israel, it's pretty clear that we have to make sure that what happened [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=425.04s)]
*  in October 7th would not happen again. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=428.48s)]
*  Therefore, we want to make sure that we extract the price tag from Hamas. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  What is the price tag from the Israeli people, the Palestinian people? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=435.44s)]
*  Because they've borne really the brunt of the burden here. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=440.24s)]
*  Correct. So we want to differentiate between the Palestinian people and Hamas. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  And like the president said, Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=445.84s)]
*  Hamas is a terror organization, a vicious, barbaric terror organization [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=448.8s)]
*  that needs to pay a price. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=452.0s)]
*  And by the way, when they talk about free Gaza, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=453.36s)]
*  I think they talk about free Gaza from Hamas. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=455.84s)]
*  So we are doing everything we can to make sure to make that differentiation. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=458.0s)]
*  We open corridors, safe corridors to have the innocent population go down south. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  We invested four days that we are waiting to make sure that they make it out. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=467.28s)]
*  We create safe shelters over there. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=470.88s)]
*  We actually have, on the other hand, Hamas pushing them back into the war zone [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=473.12s)]
*  by that creating another war card. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you understand why there's so much distrust in the Arab world [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=478.8s)]
*  of the information coming from the IDF and the narrative about what happened [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=483.2s)]
*  in this hospital blast? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=488.16s)]
*  And how is Israel going to deal with the fact that some of that distrust [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=490.56s)]
*  comes from a real place? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=494.64s)]
*  Because there have been past incidents in which the IDF has given incorrect information. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=496.32s)]
*  Well, the IDF, I think, is most of the time that we are focused on investigating [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=500.48s)]
*  and understanding what happened. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=507.04s)]
*  This is what happened this time around. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  This is what happened in the past. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=509.12s)]
*  When we get it wrong, we try to fix it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=510.72s)]
*  And sometimes we also try to fix things that we have got wrong in the past. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=512.72s)]
*  I think credibility is crucial here. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=516.88s)]
*  We are comparing between a liberal democracy with checks and balances [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=518.72s)]
*  and a terror organization. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=524.32s)]
*  And I think at this time, it's black and white. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=525.52s)]
*  We have to first of all stand by Israel, like the president said. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=527.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=530.88s)]
*  Aviv, Ezra, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=531.52s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=534.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV_OuzC9jM&t=535.2s)]
