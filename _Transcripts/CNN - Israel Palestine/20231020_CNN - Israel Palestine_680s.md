# Brother of released American hostage speaks out
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8)
*  Freed. You're looking at a picture of American Judith Ty Ra'nan and her 17-year-old daughter [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=0.0s)]
*  Natalie Ra'nan shortly after they were released by Hamas. The two from Chicago are in Israel after [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=5.2s)]
*  being kidnapped 14 days ago. The IDF says they were being held in Hamas's network of tunnels. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=11.6s)]
*  And according to the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, a team from the U.S. Embassy is here to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=18.16s)]
*  meet with them now for their family has been an unimaginable two weeks of anguish and grief and hope [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  and fear. The Ra'nans were visiting relatives at the kibbutz of Nahal Oz, which is just a couple of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=28.32s)]
*  miles from Gaza. It was attacked by Hamas. Twelve people were reportedly killed during that assault [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=34.8s)]
*  that we know of. Earlier this week, I spoke to Natalie's brother Ben, and he told me the terrifying [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=39.84s)]
*  story of how his sister and stepmother were taken. She communicated with my father in Hebrew that she [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=44.96s)]
*  was okay for the moment. She was locking herself in the guest house, I believe, with my stepmother, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=54.4s)]
*  Judith. They were hearing guns. They were hearing explosions, and they were going to try and remain [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=63.68s)]
*  as quiet as possible. From there, once the Israeli army was able to take back the city, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=69.2s)]
*  there was broken glass on the inside of the guest house, and both Natalie and Judith were missing at that point. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=77.44s)]
*  So at that time, Ben told me he was holding out hope, holding out this hope that he would again [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=88.72s)]
*  hug his sister. And that is something that he is going to be able to do. You just have to smile [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=93.28s)]
*  to hear about it. I mean, it is two people out of 203, but it is two people alive and free. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=98.56s)]
*  Natalie will turn 18 in four days. In just a moment, Ben will join me live again. It was [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=104.48s)]
*  President Biden who spoke with both of the women. Judith and Natalie says he is overjoyed at the news. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=109.76s)]
*  But, of course, we are learning tonight there are still 10 Americans unaccounted for. That is in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=114.72s)]
*  addition to the 201 people being held by Hamas at this hour, according to the numbers the Israeli [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=119.92s)]
*  government has put out. And tonight we are learning more about them. According to the Israeli [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=125.84s)]
*  Defense Forces, over 20 of them are children under the age of 18. We are going to speak to the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=129.84s)]
*  father of two of those later. Between 10 and 20 of them are over 60. But the IDF believes that the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=134.32s)]
*  majority of them are alive in Gaza. One family this morning told me, well, we do not know if [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=139.52s)]
*  majority means just over half or almost all. But that is the most information the IDF has given out, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=143.52s)]
*  is the word majority. But shortly after the Annan's release, Hamas released a statement [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=149.36s)]
*  claiming they are working with mediators in Egypt, Qatar and other quote, friendly countries in order [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=154.08s)]
*  to release more foreign national hostages. We do not know very much about their current conditions. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=159.12s)]
*  We only know we have that one supposed proof of life video. We do not know when that was filmed [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  of Miechem. And we also now have the picture of Judith and Natalie. We do know that any hostages [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=169.52s)]
*  in Gaza right now are being held captive at a place facing a humanitarian crisis. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=175.12s)]
*  We have a lot to get to tonight. Nick Robertson is live along the Israel-Gaza border. MJ Lee is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=179.36s)]
*  at the White House. And Clarissa Ward is live in Cairo, Egypt tonight. Orrin Lieberman is live [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=183.68s)]
*  at the Pentagon with breaking news on that battle, those missiles fired towards Israel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=188.64s)]
*  I want to start with Nick Robertson because, Nick, I know there was a lot of activity where [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=193.92s)]
*  you are when the two hostages were released. What exactly happened? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely fascinating, Erin, because throughout the day it had been really exceptionally [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  quiet, quieter than it's been for so many days. No missiles, no rockets coming out of Gaza, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=210.0s)]
*  no missiles going in, and not even any drones in the air. Really quiet. And it gave the impression, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=214.48s)]
*  just the impression, that something was happening in the background today that was different. We [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  had no idea. But just as that news was coming out that Natalie and her mother, Judith, were [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=225.44s)]
*  being released, Hamas or one of the other groups inside Gaza launched a massive salvo of rockets [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=231.76s)]
*  right at that time headed towards central Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted them [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=238.0s)]
*  within an hour. They'd done it again, fired multiple rockets towards the center of Israel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=243.52s)]
*  They were intercepted again. And in that intervening hour, they fired five salvos into [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=248.96s)]
*  this area in Starrat. That is way more than they fired in an hour period that we've seen over the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  past week or so. So kind of a significant turn in action by Hamas or one of the other groups [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  right at that moment of release. Was it a signal that they just wanted, that they were ready to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=269.68s)]
*  continue to fight? Or was it a sign that they'd been able to use that time when they weren't [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  under fire and drone surveillance to set up some rockets? It's not clear. But that was such a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  dramatic change of events right at that moment of release. The Israelis returned with some artillery [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=285.52s)]
*  strikes, some missile strikes. But again, now back to that aura of sort of quieter than it has been. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=292.48s)]
*  Erin? All right, Nick, thank you very much. And I want to go to MJ Lee at the White House, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=299.44s)]
*  because MJ, we were saying Biden has spoken now to both Judith and Natalie. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=306.48s)]
*  What more have you learned from your sources about how this happened from the American side and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=312.4s)]
*  what's next? Yeah, Erin, the White House says that President Biden had this message to convey to the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=317.92s)]
*  two women when he spoke with them earlier, that the two women would have the full support of the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=324.0s)]
*  government as they recover from what he said was this terrible ordeal. And there's no question that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=329.44s)]
*  this is a moment of triumph for this president who had said that as president, there was no [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=335.12s)]
*  higher priority for him than securing the release of these American hostages. But there's no question [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=340.4s)]
*  that the work is not over. Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying tonight that there are at [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=345.76s)]
*  least 10 Americans unaccounted for and that some of them are being held hostage. He couldn't say [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=350.4s)]
*  anything about the condition of those American hostages. But Erin, it is very, very clear that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=356.72s)]
*  U.S. officials worked closely with their Israeli counterparts to gather any intelligence that they [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=361.92s)]
*  could about these American hostages. We know that it was the Israelis that told U.S. officials that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  some Americans were believed to be alive. We also know that there was close coordination with Qatar, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=373.36s)]
*  both President Biden and Secretary Blinken saying thank you to their Qatari counterparts [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  after the release of these two women. But Erin, it's just worth underscoring that given the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=385.92s)]
*  sensitivities and given the ongoing efforts to try to secure the release of more hostages, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=391.12s)]
*  U.S. officials right now are very loathe to share any detailed information about how exactly Judith [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  and Natalie Ronan's release was able to be secured. All right, MJ, thank you very much. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=404.0s)]
*  And Natalie's brother, Judith's stepson, Ben Ronan, is out front now and he is speaking for the family [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=412.4s)]
*  tonight. So, Ben, we talked days ago and you know you're talking about your sister and how she wanted [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=418.32s)]
*  she loved art and she you know she she wants to be a tattoo artist maybe and you were praying you'd [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  have the chance to hug her again. And wow, what a night. I mean how did you find out your sister and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=430.88s)]
*  your stepmother were freed? I found out from the news. This all moved so quickly that I was getting [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=435.68s)]
*  texts from reporters I had met with saying this happened and and I believe it's because you know [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=446.24s)]
*  the government didn't want to call us before it had been confirmed and it was just a surreal thing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=453.36s)]
*  I was taking the first two hours of the day before I jumped on all of these things that I've been [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=461.36s)]
*  doing for Natalie just for myself and I was playing a video game and all of a sudden I'm getting all [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=467.12s)]
*  these texts that you know they're coming back. Oh my gosh, that is incredible to find out that way [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=471.6s)]
*  and I think Ben it just makes everyone realize that they they had no idea if what happened or [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=481.04s)]
*  just as you said comes together at the last second. When you see the picture, just the one picture [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=484.8s)]
*  that we have of Natalie and Judith and obviously you know them better than anyone else. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=490.64s)]
*  What do you see when you look at that? To be honest I'm super annoyed because how does my sister [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  after two weeks as a hostage still look like a supermodel? It's exhausting and meanwhile she does [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=502.71999999999997s)]
*  by the way. She does by the way. She does, it's absurd. You know my father got a chance to talk [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  with Natalie and I know Judith's family got a chance to talk with Judith at least from my father [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=515.52s)]
*  Natalie is doing well, is composed and as I said to you a couple days ago we are ready to start [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=521.36s)]
*  this incredible journey of healing and trauma relief for her and you know she has a full support [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=531.6s)]
*  of friends and family and you know what I've realized is strangers who care about her who want [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=539.6s)]
*  her to succeed at whatever she wants to do. You know do you have any idea Ben at this point? I mean [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=546.96s)]
*  I'm sure you don't technically know but I mean do you have any even thought or have you thought to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=556.24s)]
*  yourself about why it is that Natalie and Judith were released first? Why them not anyone else yet? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=560.96s)]
*  I mean do you have any sense as to how that's the case? I don't know. You know what I do know [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=567.04s)]
*  is that you know what I told you a couple days ago that they're not politicians. They're not people [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  with intense feelings about Gaza, Palestine, Israel. You know they are Israelis and but they are lovers [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=581.12s)]
*  and they are people lovers and so I truly believe it was something to do with that [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=591.68s)]
*  and it's important for me to also say that that there are people hurting who are hostages that [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=596.88s)]
*  didn't get the same beautiful news that that my family got today and there are families all over [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  in Gaza and in Israel that are experiencing a loss that I can't even imagine and I just [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=613.28s)]
*  my family just went through this. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=620.48s)]
*  No no I know I can only imagine there's a sense of guilt too. I was talking to a father who's [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=625.36s)]
*  still missing his little girls two and four and I asked him how he felt about this news and you know [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=630.08s)]
*  he said I just miss my children so much but of course I'm so glad for you right? I mean right [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=635.52s)]
*  but there's this right there's a deep sense of grief still for so many. Do you know Ben when you'll [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=641.44s)]
*  be able to speak with her? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=648.08s)]
*  We have heard tentatively she might be coming back to Chicago sometime early next week but that's all [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=652.72s)]
*  dependent obviously on what the hospitals say and making sure that their physical well-being [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=662.0s)]
*  and their mental health well-being is at least okay for them to come here and start this next stage. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gpi9S7P_c8&t=670.72s)]
