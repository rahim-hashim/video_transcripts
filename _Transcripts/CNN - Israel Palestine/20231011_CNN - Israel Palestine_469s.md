# Israel forms emergency war cabinet
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs)
*  Top of the hour. I'm John Berman with Kate Baldwin and Sarah Seidner. The breaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=0.0s)]
*  news right now in the middle of a war. We just learned that Israel has formed [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=3.96s)]
*  what they're calling an emergency government in a war cabinet. This is [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=8.52s)]
*  significant. It is according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who made the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=11.4s)]
*  announcement just moments ago. All of this as hundreds of thousands of Israeli [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=14.48s)]
*  reservists are staged outside Gaza. Let's get right to seeing as Becky Anderson [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=18.66s)]
*  who is in Tel Aviv who can explain this shift with inside the government. Becky [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=23.56s)]
*  and what it means. Becky. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=29.639999999999997s)]
*  Well, this is really important. What we understand is that these discussions [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=33.94s)]
*  have now been going on for some days and I have to say there was some [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  speculation. We might actually get this news yesterday, but clearly these [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=42.4s)]
*  negotiations on who is in this, you know, unity government and particularly [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=45.92s)]
*  in what will be this war cabinet have been very, very difficult. But as we [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=53.12s)]
*  understand it now, this is Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister in unity [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=58.2s)]
*  now in a coalition government in a war cabinet with Benny Gantz who is the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  leader of the National Unity Party and opposition leader, former defense [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  minister, of course, and the defense minister, Ghulam. They will sit in this [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=75.64s)]
*  war cabinet. This is an emergency situation which is being addressed now [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  by those who have experience of war in government here. What isn't clear is what [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=87.64s)]
*  the makeup of this kind of wider group will be. And sources have been telling me [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=95.84s)]
*  that there has been much discussion and demands made by those in opposition that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=100.72s)]
*  the right wing ministers, the finance and national security ministers, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  Ben Gavir and Smoltrich would not be part of this. I can't stand that up at [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=114.08s)]
*  present. All we know and we can report at this time is that Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=118.76s)]
*  now in unity with Benny Gantz and the defense minister here, Ghulam, to address [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  what happens next. And the sense is here that what you didn't have in the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  cabinet in the government until Saturday morning was experience. And what Israel [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=139.88s)]
*  now needs is experience and characters, authoritative characters in position who [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=147.92s)]
*  reflect the unity of the Israelis. So this is, I'm being told now, I'm just [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=156.2s)]
*  getting a new reporting on this. This is an emergency cabinet, a war cabinet at [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=163.92s)]
*  this point. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  And Becky, for those who aren't familiar maybe with, I'll call them the players [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  within Israeli politics so much, just some background here of what a big deal [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=177.92s)]
*  this is as you describe it, because these are political parties and these are men [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=184.0s)]
*  who are before now deeply hostile to one another in terms of the politics of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Israel. And it really does underline the scale of the crisis, how much has changed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=197.68s)]
*  in Israel since Saturday. Just the background, if you can offer, of kind of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  earth shattering is what Saturday was with the Hamas terror attack. And this as [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=211.72000000000003s)]
*  a response to it, just the perspective on that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=216.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think if we just step back and consider what is going on, been going [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=220.08s)]
*  on here for months and months, has been this deep, deep division, reflected on the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=226.56s)]
*  streets of Tel Aviv and around this country by, you know, hundreds of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=233.96s)]
*  thousands of Israelis demonstrating, protesting against what has been Israel's [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=238.44s)]
*  most right-wing government ever. This sense now that there is an absolute need to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=244.4s)]
*  bring, you know, to bring those who are running this country together, you know, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  in a war cabinet that can now address the security concerns that Israel now faces [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=260.04s)]
*  with experience. There has been, you know, much talk around the judicial reform of how [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=268.32s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and his right wing have not been focused on what Israelis themselves [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=275.52s)]
*  believe is important for them. And on Saturday morning, you know, that was revealed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=284.2s)]
*  Security and protection. Where was, why was there such a failure of intelligence? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=290.0s)]
*  Why is it now that Israelis feel such a sense of insecurity, of vulnerability? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  And it was to, you know, to the prime minister to organise around him, to ensure now [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  that the fingers of blame aren't pointed at him squarely on what happens going [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=314.08000000000004s)]
*  forward. And now, you know, the crucial nature of what is in play here, the complexity of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  what happens next with regard any incursion, ground incursion into Gaza, you know, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=329.04s)]
*  the sense now that the decisions that are made here in Israel about what happens in [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=335.68s)]
*  the days and weeks ahead should not be left to a government that frankly didn't have [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  the experience in cabinet to address these issues. So that now looks like, you know, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  the make-up that we have in what is this new war cabinet. I can describe it as such [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  with the current defence minister, the former defence minister, Benny Gantt and Benjamin [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu, heading up the decision-making for the state of Israel to address, as I say, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=367.68s)]
*  the complexities of what happens next. And let's just consider those. They have a ground [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=374.88s)]
*  incursion on the table. They have, as described by the IDF, saturated the southern border [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=380.96000000000004s)]
*  with troops now in anticipation, one assumes, of a ground incursion. We're not seeing that [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  as of yet. But the complexities we've been reporting now for hours, in that you have [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=397.28s)]
*  these hostages being held in various locations, as described by Hamas, around Gaza. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=404.0s)]
*  And then the wider story here, which is the plight of the Palestinians, we know we already [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  have who are in Gaza. We already have a thousand dead, a total siege of Gaza, hospitals being [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=414.55999999999995s)]
*  bombed, no fuel now to the power station there. I mean, Palestinians do work with generators in [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=422.72s)]
*  Gaza, so there'll be some generation of electricity, or electricity provided by generators. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=431.6s)]
*  But, you know, considering what it is that Israel faces as decision-making now, it has been clear [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  for some time that there was a need for, I don't want to call it level-headedness, but experience. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  And this will be, you know, this will be demands from the outside, you know, from the international [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=451.28s)]
*  community, from capitals around the world, particularly from Washington, demands that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=458.0s)]
*  this war cabinet has the experience to make decisions at this time. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FD28jY6vkhs&t=462.47999999999996s)]
