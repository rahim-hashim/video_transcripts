# Hamas says it has agreed to ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA)
*  breaking news in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas has announced that it has agreed to a ceasefire agreement proposed by Egypt and [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=1.8s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  We're waiting to see if Israel will accept the deal as well. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Beth Sander is a former deputy director of National Intelligence Force. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=10.32s)]
*  She's joining us on the phone. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=13.56s)]
*  So what's your reaction? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=15.16s)]
*  Beth, let me just read to you a little bit from the statement that Hamas released. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=16.16s)]
*  The statement said that Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political bureau of Hamas, quote, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=20.72s)]
*  made a phone call to the Qatari Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=26.08s)]
*  and to the Egyptian Minister of Intelligence, Mr. Abbas Kamal, and informed them of Hamas' [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=32.16s)]
*  agreement to their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=37.64s)]
*  What's your reaction, Beth? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=42.08s)]
*  Well, I think that first we have to hold our breath here, but I do think that the Israelis [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  are likely to sign on, since this is the same terms as far as we know to what they have [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=52.4s)]
*  signed on earlier. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=58.36s)]
*  So I'm actually pretty hopeful. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=60.44s)]
*  I think that the military pressure and this idea that the Rafah operation was about to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=62.68s)]
*  go forward may have made the difference. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=67.6s)]
*  The last framework proposal that we know about, Beth, had the release of 20 to 33 Israeli hostages [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=71.28s)]
*  over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=78.8s)]
*  prisoners being held by Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  And that was supposed to result in a restoration of sustainable calm, during which the remaining [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=87.96s)]
*  hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies of hostages, would also be exchanged [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=93.88s)]
*  for the release of more Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  That was an earlier proposal that was clearly discussed with both Qatar and Egypt. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=102.44s)]
*  If that is the plan right now and if Hamas has agreed to that, that would be a huge development. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=107.48s)]
*  An absolutely huge development. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=114.76s)]
*  And I think that part of the issue here is that Yaya Sinwar, who is, as far as we know, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=116.48s)]
*  still hold up in southern Gaza, and the political leadership, Hanie, who is the one who said [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  publicly that they were a go. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=131.56s)]
*  They have trouble communicating. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  It's hard for them to do that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  But also they're not completely on the same page. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=138.23999999999998s)]
*  And they don't have the same interests in some ways, given that Sinwar, you know, is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  potentially staring down the barrel with a gun and also the party who wants to walk away [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=145.64s)]
*  from this and survive. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  So you know, it could be a very big deal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=152.56s)]
*  And I think that this delay may have been part of the discussion and trying to hear [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=155.28s)]
*  back from Sinwar inside of Gaza. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=159.88s)]
*  Beth, stand by. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=162.48s)]
*  I want to go to Jeremy Diamond. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=164.12s)]
*  He's joining us live from Jerusalem right now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=165.56s)]
*  Jeremy, has there been any reaction from the Israeli government to what the Hamas has just [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=167.76s)]
*  announced? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=172.84s)]
*  Wolf, there has not yet. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=175.16s)]
*  And so we are applying a lot of caveats to this news that is just breaking at this hour. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=176.72s)]
*  And that is, Wolf, that we have now heard from Hamas in a statement that they posted to their [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=182.16s)]
*  Telegram channel saying that they have agreed to the proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=186.28s)]
*  Ismail Hani Hamas is political leader speaking to the Qatari prime minister as well as the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=192.32s)]
*  Egyptian intelligence chief to relay that message. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=197.56s)]
*  But as you said, Wolf, we have yet to hear from the Israeli government officially. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=200.52s)]
*  We have yet to hear from the Americans, from the Egyptians, from the Qataris. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=204.34s)]
*  And so we do have to caveat this this news, which does carry with it quite a bit of promise [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=207.96s)]
*  and hope here. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=213.8s)]
*  Hope, of course, for the hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza who have endured unspeakable [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=215.08s)]
*  horrors over seven months of war, as well as for the families of those hostages who [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=220.12s)]
*  remain captive in Gaza, who have hoped and prayed for the day that they will get to hold [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=225.52s)]
*  their loved ones in their arms once again. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=230.08s)]
*  But what we do know, Wolf, is that there has been an Egyptian framework on the table over [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  the course of the last week, which officials on all sides had had a lot of hope that it [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=237.02s)]
*  could potentially bring these two sides together, in particular because Israel did make several [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=242.24s)]
*  key concessions, including allowing the return, the unrestricted return of Palestinians to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=248.06s)]
*  northern Gaza as part of this latest framework, something that they had resisted for some [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=253.10000000000002s)]
*  time and had been a major sticking point. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=257.02s)]
*  This framework agreement that was on the table last week would see the release of some 20 [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=259.54s)]
*  to 33 Israeli hostages over several weeks of a ceasefire and then ultimately leading [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=263.98s)]
*  to a longer term ceasefire, perhaps a one year ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=271.1s)]
*  Israel had not agreed to every point in this framework, but it had it did have significant [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=276.42s)]
*  input in this framework as it was then presented to Hamas. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=281.82s)]
*  We've watched, Wolf, over the last few days as that optimism around those negotiations [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=285.46s)]
*  had quickly soured. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=291.78s)]
*  It appeared that Hamas was sticking to its demand that an end to the war altogether, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=293.42s)]
*  that Israel commit to that as part of this agreement, something that Israel has refused [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=297.86s)]
*  to do. But now, hours after the Israeli military began dropping evacuation leaflets on [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=302.06s)]
*  eastern Ra'afa, ordering 100,000 civilians to flee, Hamas now putting in a statement [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=308.02s)]
*  hours later that they have agreed to this initial proposal. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=313.78s)]
*  We don't know whether that evacuation order in Ra'afa was the key factor that changed [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=316.78s)]
*  Hamas's mind. We also don't know whether any major changes to this Egyptian framework [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=322.14s)]
*  have been made in order to get Hamas to agree to it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=326.85999999999996s)]
*  And like I said, we have yet to hear from all of the other parties involved. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=330.26s)]
*  So as much as there is a promise and hope in this statement from Hamas, there is certainly [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=334.42s)]
*  not certainty at this stage. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=339.06s)]
*  Wolf. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=341.7s)]
*  Jeremy, I want you to stand by M.J. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=343.22s)]
*  Lee, our White House correspondent, is getting more information. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=345.1s)]
*  U.S. reaction. I take it M.J., the president, President Biden, had a conversation, a phone [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=347.82s)]
*  conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=352.9s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=356.5s)]
*  That's right. We know President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=357.94s)]
*  earlier today. And of course, these ongoing hostage deal negotiations was one of the many [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=362.42s)]
*  topics that the two leaders discussed, as has been the case for all of their recent [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=367.74s)]
*  phone conversations. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=372.3s)]
*  But what we are waiting for right now is an official White House and U.S. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=373.94s)]
*  reaction to this news that Hamas has apparently agreed to a temporary ceasefire deal. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=378.18s)]
*  So we'll bring that to you whenever we have word of that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=384.3s)]
*  But I heard Jeremy in his last conversation with you really leaning into the various [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=387.54s)]
*  caveats that are at play here. And I do think that kind of a note of caution from here in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=393.26s)]
*  Washington is wise as well. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=399.02s)]
*  That is just to say that we have had moments like this before in the months of negotiations [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=401.1s)]
*  to get to a temporary ceasefire and hostages release deal where we appear to be on the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=406.58s)]
*  brink of a deal and other moments where we appear to be on the brink of these talks [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=411.9s)]
*  completely falling apart. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=417.18s)]
*  So, again, as we wait for official U.S. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=418.62s)]
*  word and reaction from the Israeli side to this news from Hamas that they are agreeing to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=421.46s)]
*  this deal, I do think, again, just leaning into that note of caution is definitely worth [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=426.34000000000003s)]
*  doing. But what U.S. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=432.54s)]
*  officials have been doing, of course, in recent weeks is very much pushing hard for this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=434.58s)]
*  deal to get done because the administration believes that this is really the only clear [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=439.26s)]
*  way to eventually getting to an end to this war. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=444.54s)]
*  But I can't underscore enough how important it is for U.S. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=448.1s)]
*  officials to try to get to that point, to try to get to the point of hostages coming out [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=451.54s)]
*  and this this conflict that has been going on for so many months to come to an end. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=456.3s)]
*  And of course, a big part of that is avoiding a major RAFA incursion from taking place. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  And of course, the Israelis have been warning for weeks and weeks now that they are getting [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=466.5s)]
*  increasingly prepared to go ahead and take that step if this deal does not come together. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=470.22s)]
*  Wolf, is the White House still planning a press briefing at the bottom of the hour in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=475.26s)]
*  about 15 minutes or so from now? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=480.14s)]
*  MJ? Yeah, that press briefing has actually been pushed back to two o'clock. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=482.1s)]
*  So that is when we will hear from National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby and [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=486.1s)]
*  where we will get an opportunity to press him on all of these latest developments. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=490.7s)]
*  And of course, we'll be bringing that to you as well. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=494.86s)]
*  Wolf. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fgF6OBxURA&t=496.46000000000004s)]
