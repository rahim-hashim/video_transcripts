# Erin Burnett presses IDF spokesman on whereabouts of hostages held by Hamas on Oct. 7 anniversary
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk)
*  Out front now, the Israeli Defense Forces spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=0.0s)]
*  Colonel, I appreciate your time tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=4.8s)]
*  I know that Israel has still not responded to Iran's massive ballistic missile attack. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=7.12s)]
*  Is the IDF ready to strike tonight if you get the order? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=14.32s)]
*  The government will instruct the IDF and we will act accordingly. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=18.88s)]
*  Our role is to place on the table the scenarios, the options that the government can make, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=22.0s)]
*  and the government will instruct us accordingly. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=28.24s)]
*  The message has been very clear from all levels of government and the defense establishment that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=30.72s)]
*  181 ballistic missiles is unacceptable. I would add that one ballistic missile is unacceptable. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=36.72s)]
*  So Israel is preparing itself and when the government gives us the instructions, we will operate. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=44.8s)]
*  Of course, there was a ballistic missile fired today from Yemen, which was intercepted. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  You know, and we obviously hear explosions even now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=57.36s)]
*  The Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that the October 7th [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=60.88s)]
*  attack last year, though, Colonel, set Israel back 70 years. What's your response to him? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  So the Islamic Republic of Iran tried with all its might to create a ring of proxies around Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=72.16s)]
*  All of those proxies are being defeated every single day. So I would say to Iran to watch very, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=81.92s)]
*  very cautiously, I think that their attempt to try and distance themselves and try and perhaps [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=90.0s)]
*  through this way safeguard themselves has been very, very careless. The IDF is fighting against [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=96.08s)]
*  all of these enemies and decapitating them and making them pay and not permitting them to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=105.04s)]
*  try and conduct the nefarious intentions of the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  Colonel Lerner, Barak Ravid of Axios reported just a bit ago that Yahya Senwar, the chief of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  Hamas, has resurfaced. There had been reports that he had been silent and perhaps was dead, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  that he has now been, he has resurfaced. What do you know about his condition tonight, sir? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=128.8s)]
*  So I don't know what Barak Ravid has been reporting. We know that Yahya Senwar, the arch-terrorist, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=135.28s)]
*  the mastermind and architect of the October 7th attack, is responsible and must be held [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=142.72s)]
*  accountable for his actions. First of all, we need to bring home the remaining 101 hostages. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=149.6s)]
*  But yeah, as we've said, Senwar is a dead man walking, and I would very much urge him to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  release the hostages and that Hamas should surrender. This is a year that has been going [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=162.48s)]
*  on far too long, and the reality needs to change for Israelis and Palestinians alike. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=167.28s)]
*  Colonel, many of the families of the hostages that we saw today are angry, and they're angry [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  at the Israeli government. Many of them believe that it is a choice that the government has made [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=176.56s)]
*  to fight the war in Gaza, to now fight a war in Lebanon, to fight a broadening war when the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=181.6s)]
*  government could have focused on bringing their family members home. 97 people who were taken [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=187.68s)]
*  hostage on October 7th are still in Gaza. 101 hostages there still in total. We understand 36 [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=193.68s)]
*  of them are already dead, but there have been reports that that number could be as many as 50. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=199.68s)]
*  Do you know the latest on this horrific number right now? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  Colonel, I think the most important thing is to bring them home. The most important thing is to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=211.68s)]
*  create the conditions to bring home the hostages. We've watched throughout the day on CNN and elsewhere [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=218.08s)]
*  the pain that the families of the hostages are going through. We feel as the IDF that our mission [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  is yet to be accomplished precisely because there are 101 remaining in the hands and clutches of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  Hamas. Many of them are, we understand, are alive, and some of them are indeed have been [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=237.2s)]
*  pronounced dead. So they need to come home. We need to do everything we can to bring them home. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=244.16s)]
*  It's our obligation as the military. It's our responsibility also to Israeli society. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=249.04s)]
*  That is the ethos of the IDF, that we don't leave people behind. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  Colonel Peter Lerner with the IDF, thanks so much for your time tonight. We appreciate it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=258.88s)]
*  Good evening. Good day. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=262.71999999999997s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=263.52s)]
*  And out front now, Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling, the former Army Commanding General for Europe. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=266.64s)]
*  And General, I appreciate your time. You know, you heard Colonel Lerner there, and it's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=270.96s)]
*  obviously here, and now the early hours of October 8th, saying the IDF is ready whenever they get the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=274.32s)]
*  order to strike. What do you expect Israel will do, General? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  Outlining what their requirements are, Aaron, they're facing a three-front war. We've talked [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=284.96s)]
*  about this multiple times. They will continue their offensive into Lebanon because they have to. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=293.84s)]
*  They keep being continued to continue to be attacked by Hezbollah out of that country. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=299.84s)]
*  They will continue their strikes in Gaza because they haven't completed that action yet. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=304.96s)]
*  Their deterrence, I mean, I heard the word deterrence used a little while ago. I would say [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  that Israel is more interested in escalation dominance. Can they strike inside of Iran [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  and not have this thing escalate to the point where it will be harmful to Israel? So they are [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=322.8s)]
*  going to continue to attack in the north and in Gaza. They are going to attack and establish [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=328.88s)]
*  retribution against the 181 ballistic missiles that were fired the other night. The targets [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  they will hit will be interesting to watch. There's a list of them, but I'm not sure when [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=339.76s)]
*  they will attack. I would almost suggest that they have started their offensive operation against [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=344.96s)]
*  Iran in a more covert way. There will be explosions. There will be a kinetic attack, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  but there have been other things happening as well. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=357.52s)]
*  That's right, and of course it's hard to piece it all together. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=361.68s)]
*  You know, as I mentioned, here in Tel Aviv you've got the October 7th and just the somber grief of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=364.96s)]
*  it and those hostages just 40 miles away. Their families don't know whether they're dead or alive. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=370.64s)]
*  And yet on that day, one of the busiest days in terms of missile attacks on Tel Aviv by Iranian [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=376.8s)]
*  backed militias since the very earliest days of the war, General. So what does that say to you? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=382.56s)]
*  When you think of the fact that two-thirds of Gaza is leveled, tens of thousands of people are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=388.0s)]
*  dead there. And yet today there were sirens here. Hamas fired on Tel Aviv. We had ballistic missiles [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=392.4s)]
*  just about an hour and a half or two hours ago come in from Hezbollah, and in the late afternoon [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=399.76s)]
*  there were ballistic missiles intercepted coming from the Houthis in Yemen. What does it say that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=404.96s)]
*  after a year all of that capability is still there? Well, it's been thwarted to a degree, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=410.0s)]
*  Aaron, but it's still going to happen. And interestingly enough, I was surprised by the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=417.04s)]
*  launches of additional missiles, rockets primarily out of Gaza. But the extent of what has been [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=423.12s)]
*  launched by Lebanon, you mentioned earlier it was 190 today, and that seems to be the highest number [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  in the last couple of months. But they've averaged anywhere from 30 to 150 a day. They have been hit, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=437.36s)]
*  but in having fought terrorist organizations, they want to show they're still on the battlefield [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=444.72s)]
*  no matter how much they are depleted, no matter how much they have deteriorated and are in a [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=450.48s)]
*  dysfunctional state. So you will continue to see rockets being launched out of Lebanon, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=455.76000000000005s)]
*  and you'll continue to see Iran trying to control those proxies. As you said and Jim Chuteau reported [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=461.04s)]
*  earlier, there were launches from Yemen as well. That continues. So all of these fighting forces [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  represent Iran forward. They're going to continue to launch missiles because that's what they can do [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=474.4s)]
*  until the last one is destroyed. All right, General Hurtling, thank you very much. I appreciate your [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=480.8s)]
*  time in the early hours now here in Tel Aviv of October 8th, a new year beginning, and we await [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=488.48s)]
*  this possible strike. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjzssOEOlk&t=496.64s)]
