# Israel and Lebanon trade accusations of ceasefire violations
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI)
*  The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah is now in its third day and appears to be holding by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=0.0s)]
*  and large despite new accusations against both sides. Israel says it thwarted what it called [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=6.4s)]
*  terrorist activity and struck a rocket storage site used by Hezbollah on Thursday. Well, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=12.56s)]
*  meanwhile, the Lebanese army claims Israel has breached the terms of the ceasefire numerous times [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=18.48s)]
*  since it went into effect on Wednesday morning. He's the Israeli Foreign Minister. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=24.32s)]
*  What will happen in the ground is the most important thing and we will not allow to breach [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=28.16s)]
*  the arrangement. We will respond immediately to every violation. We will not let the Hezbollah [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=36.88s)]
*  to go down to go south and then the Latani River. We will not let Hezbollah to rearm again and build [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=46.08s)]
*  itself as a danger to Israel once again. The people of Lebanon meanwhile are desperate [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=54.12s)]
*  for a return to normalcy. Thousands displaced by the 13 months of fighting have started returning [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=63.4s)]
*  to their homes and businesses, many of them destroyed even as Israel warns that some areas [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=70.12s)]
*  are not safe yet. Thank God now we're back and we're back stronger and better than before. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=75.64s)]
*  We have strength and determination and we're cleaning up our stores. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=83.72s)]
*  We will work on getting our businesses back better than before [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=87.64s)]
*  and don't let the occupation think that it has defeated us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=91.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sounding more optimistic about a ceasefire in [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=95.0s)]
*  Gaza but he insists on achieving one of his major goals. Here's what he told Israel's Channel 14. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm ready for a ceasefire at any moment but ending the war I'm not ready for that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=106.68s)]
*  because we also need to achieve the elimination of Hamas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile Israel's attacks continue. Gaza's health ministry says Israeli bombs killed at least 20 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=119.56s)]
*  people on Thursday. Several homes in Nusrat were hit sending dozens of victims to Al Awar [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=125.64000000000001s)]
*  Hospital with injuries. The hospital director claims Israeli forces are blocking delivery [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=132.52s)]
*  of medical supplies, food and fuel to the hospital. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  Well let's go live now to Abu Dhabi and CNN's Paula Hancocks who's standing by. Paula let's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=145.72s)]
*  start with the situation in Lebanon. It's a tenuous truce but it seems to be holding. Is there [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=151.0s)]
*  growing confidence this could be long lasting? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=156.36s)]
*  Well I don't think there's growing confidence yet. There is certainly cautious optimism when [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=163.4s)]
*  it comes to those in Lebanon that this could last but of course there are some in Israel that still [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  don't agree with the fact this ceasefire was was carried out in the first place. What we're hearing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  though is that it is an uneasy truce, that it is holding for the most part. There have been a couple [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=181.72s)]
*  of occasions where both sides have accused the other of breaching the terms of this ceasefire. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=188.68s)]
*  You mentioned them briefly, the fact that Israel carried out an airstrike on what it said was [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=195.72s)]
*  Hezbollah terrorists and they say that was in an area where Hezbollah had stored some of its [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=201.0s)]
*  medium-range rockets and there was a separate incident as well where Israel says that it did [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=207.88s)]
*  target what it called suspects in southern Lebanon. Now for its part the Lebanese army, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=214.52s)]
*  which is going to take control as per this ceasefire in southern Lebanon and patrol this [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  area to make sure Hezbollah cannot regroup and rearm, they have said that Israel on a number of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  occasions have breached the terms of the ceasefire. So it is going to last 60 days. This is how long [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=231.4s)]
*  this ceasefire system will last until, as many hope, it will be the basis of a permanent ceasefire. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=238.68s)]
*  We have heard it be made very clear on a number of occasions by Israeli officials that they won't be [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=247.4s)]
*  pulling out the Israeli military immediately and they are saying to residents of much of southern [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  Lebanon, in fact more than 70 villages and towns do not return home at this point, it is not safe [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=259.8s)]
*  and we will tell you when it is safe because they still have the Israeli military stationed in this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=266.28s)]
*  area. We heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in that Channel 14 interview. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=271.32s)]
*  He said if this framework, this ceasefire is violated it will lead to an intense war. So Israel [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=277.32s)]
*  is being very clear that if it perceives a violation of this ceasefire then they will act forcefully. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=284.84s)]
*  Anna? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  Paula, there is obviously hope that the Lebanon ceasefire is perhaps a precursor for Gaza. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=294.12s)]
*  We obviously heard those comments earlier from the Israeli Prime Minister but we know this is a very [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  different situation. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=305.88s)]
*  And that is what Netanyahu said, Anna. He said that there were two very different directives and [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=311.88s)]
*  objectives when it came to these two wars. In Lebanon the Israeli military and the government [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=317.16s)]
*  said that they wanted to be able to move tens of thousands of residents back to the border and make [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=323.16s)]
*  it safe for them. In Gaza they have been very clear, the Prime Minister saying he wants to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=328.6s)]
*  eliminate Hamas. So what he is saying is he is very happy to have a ceasefire at this point and he [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=334.36s)]
*  believes that the killing of the former Chief Yahya Sinwar will make that easier, something that [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=340.6s)]
*  Washington has backed up, but he is not ready for the end of the war. Now of course what that does [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=346.52s)]
*  is it makes it very difficult for those who are going to be mediating and negotiating to try and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=352.12s)]
*  convince Hamas to sign on to a deal where the war is not going to be ended. We have heard from Hamas [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=358.28s)]
*  itself saying that they want a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of IDF troops from [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=364.28s)]
*  Gaza. Everything we are hearing from the Israeli side suggests that that is not what Netanyahu was [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=370.76s)]
*  looking at at this point. Anna. Paula Hancock in Abu Dhabi. Good to see you. Appreciate the report. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=376.68s)]
*  Thank you. Well Salah El-Maknoukt is a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute. He joins us [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=382.52s)]
*  now from Beirut. Salah, thank you for joining us. I want to start with how people are feeling [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=389.4s)]
*  returning to their homes in Lebanon, to these devastated neighbourhoods. There's obviously a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=395.56s)]
*  mixture of emotions. What have you been witnessing where you are in Beirut? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=400.52s)]
*  Good morning Anna. Thank you for having me. So for about 48 hours, self-evidently there was a feeling [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=406.92s)]
*  of relief. The solid majority of Lebanese want this war to end, but not only for it to end, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=413.56s)]
*  for this to be the last war where Lebanon is used as proxy territory for regional battles. However, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=421.16s)]
*  beginning yesterday, I would say the mood of cautious optimism has begun to be restrained. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=430.04s)]
*  I wouldn't go as far as to say that it is now behind us. This increasingly feels like a pause [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=440.68s)]
*  in fighting. This increasingly feels like this agreement is unsustainable. All signs do point out [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=447.8s)]
*  to the intention predominantly of Hezbollah of circumventing this agreement. We've seen a number [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=456.68s)]
*  of statements by Hezbollah officials undermining the army, limiting the ability of UNIFIL to carry [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=464.2s)]
*  out its job. And therefore it increasingly feels like this is an opportunity not to end the war, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=470.92s)]
*  but to rearm, re-equip and live to fight another day, unfortunately. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=477.32s)]
*  I would like to talk more about why you feel this truce is unsustainable because obviously we saw [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=483.24s)]
*  Israel strike Hezbollah militants, but there didn't seem to be an indication or a desire [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  that either side wants to return to all-out war. That's not how you're reading the situation. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=496.76s)]
*  Anna, we've seen this movie before. This is a repeat of 2006 on steroids. What happened in 2006 [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=501.64s)]
*  is after an initial early acquiescence of Hezbollah to the terms of the agreement, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  we saw attack on UNIFIL peacekeepers. We saw an overtaking of the Lebanese government in 2008. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=519.08s)]
*  And since then, there was a gradual process of re-arming and re-equipping, which led us to the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=526.36s)]
*  current war. So what I've seen over the past 48 hours in terms of statements by Hezbollah officials [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=532.04s)]
*  actually point out to the fact that this agreement will not in fact be sustainable as [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  the mediator, which is the United States. And if this pause in fighting wants to have a chance of [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=550.12s)]
*  survival, there needs to be a very concerted effort by the international community to keep its eye on [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=558.12s)]
*  the ball and not repeat the mistakes of 2006. Primarily by... Sorry. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=564.36s)]
*  Osela, I was just going to say, if this is as tenuous as what you were saying, I guess this [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=571.4s)]
*  does not bode well for a ceasefire in Gaza. I think there's an overstating of the intrinsic [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=576.68s)]
*  relationship between a ceasefire in Lebanon and ceasefire in Gaza. The situation in Gaza has its [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=586.92s)]
*  own very difficult particularities and would need to be solved. And I think that's a very [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=593.16s)]
*  difficult particularities and would need to be solved on its own, but at least vis-à-vis Lebanon [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  unless there's a concerted and holistic effort to support the Lebanese army, to ensure that [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  the Lebanese government is standing by this deal and to make sure that uniform soldiers do not [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=612.04s)]
*  behave as hostages, but rather as sovereignty-enhancing peacekeepers. In addition to making sure that Iran [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=620.5999999999999s)]
*  wants to push Hezbollah to abide by this deal, there's very little chance that this deal will [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=628.92s)]
*  lead to a permanent situation of calm and stability here in Lebanon. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLtraei8ewI&t=635.7199999999999s)]
