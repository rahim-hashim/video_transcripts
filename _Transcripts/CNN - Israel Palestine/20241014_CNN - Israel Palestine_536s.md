# Israel continues to bomb Gaza, striking a hospital and a school
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8)
*  Today, the United Nations begins the second phase of its emergency polio vaccination campaign in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=0.0s)]
*  It was due to administer some vaccinations at a school in the Nazareth refugee camp. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=6.4s)]
*  But the video we are about to show you, which we warn you is disturbing, shows relatives, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=11.52s)]
*  heartbreak and horror after that school was hit by an Israeli airstrike Sunday. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=17.44s)]
*  Hospital officials say at least 22 people were killed, some of them children. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  The UN says it had to cancel its plan to start administering [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=27.439999999999998s)]
*  vaccinations at the school as a result of this devastating attack. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=31.04s)]
*  UNWA's Director of Planning, Sam Rose, joins us now live from Gaza to give us an update on [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=36.4s)]
*  the polio vaccination rollout and, importantly, the impact that this strike on the school has had. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=43.36s)]
*  Sam, good to see you. Thank you for taking the time. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=49.84s)]
*  We've seen two deadly airstrikes in Gaza, importantly, the one on the school [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=52.16s)]
*  which was an important point for rolling out polio vaccinations. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=57.2s)]
*  Give us a sense of the impact of the strike on your plans. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=62.32s)]
*  Absolutely. Thanks for having me on. I mean, this school was one of 29 [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=68.88s)]
*  points that we were going to use, sensors that we were going to use for the first day of the polio [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  vaccination campaign today in four health centers across central Gaza and 25 schools. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=82.56s)]
*  And, of course, given the horrific, tragic, harrowing events of what happened overnight [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=90.64s)]
*  with reports of 22 people killed while they slept, majority women and children, we've not [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  been able to administer the polio campaign at that school in circumstances like this. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=105.36s)]
*  And we've had hundreds of occasions and hundreds of incidents over the past 12 months when our [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=112.72s)]
*  schools have hit. We've got a very kind of routine mechanism for providing immediate care for those [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  who've been affected whilst the emergency services also tend to the high numbers of casualties. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=124.64s)]
*  So immediate human impact, obviously, we just had to reorient and readjust the polio campaign, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=130.72s)]
*  which is coming to the end of its first day today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=137.04s)]
*  Give us a sense of how the rest of the polio vaccination campaign is going on right now, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  how successful it will be. And now that you've lost one of the sites, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=150.24s)]
*  what that means overall for ensuring absolute immunity in Gaza? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=154.16s)]
*  I mean, it makes an already more difficult effort, more difficult, but we are confident [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=160.96s)]
*  that we will be able to administer the remainder of the campaign successfully in central Gaza and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=167.12s)]
*  southern Gaza. During the hours of 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. pauses have been agreed, pauses in fighting, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=176.32s)]
*  pauses in the issuance of evacuation orders, forcing people to move. In the first round of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  the polio campaign, those pauses held. But what we saw during that campaign and what we saw so [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=191.04s)]
*  horrifically overnight, both in the school in Nusayrat and in a hospital courtyard in Dara Bella, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=197.44s)]
*  just a few kilometers away, where again, tragically, civilians died and were smothered [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=204.16s)]
*  and asphyxiated underneath plastic sheets as a result of military operations, is that we can [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=210.32s)]
*  vaccinate children against polio, but we can't keep them safe from everything else that's killing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=216.24s)]
*  them right now in Gaza. That's the real tragedy of all this tragedy that we even have to be [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=222.48s)]
*  administering a polio campaign. But thanks to the professionalism of our staff, of ministry staff, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  of other staff from UN agencies and NGOs, we are confident that the campaign in southern and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=235.68s)]
*  central Gaza will be a success. The north of the Gaza Strip, unfortunately, that remains too [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=242.48s)]
*  early to tell. Certainly, if the conditions that obtain right now in northern Gaza are those that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=249.2s)]
*  we're faced with next week when we're about to start, it will be nigh on impossible to administer [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=256.08s)]
*  a successful campaign up there. And as you rightly said, if we're not able to administer [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=262.24s)]
*  vaccines to enough children, we don't only impact on those children, but the overall success [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=268.88s)]
*  of the campaign is compromised, increased risk of a reemergence, a spread of the disease inside Gaza [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=274.8s)]
*  and unfortunately elsewhere. Sam, your highlights are something really important. You said that you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=282.64s)]
*  can vaccinate against polio, but you can't protect the children and the civilian population against [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  other externalities and the reality of these airstrikes. You mentioned the hospital strike. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=294.96s)]
*  We've heard from so many people on the ground and some witnesses that describe absolutely harrowing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  aftermath and just the conditions. So what is required by hospitals right now medically, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=307.12s)]
*  because there isn't enough to treat some of the wounded after these very deadly strikes in the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=314.88s)]
*  matter of the day? First of all, what's required is for these hospitals to be protected for their [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=321.04s)]
*  civilian character, to be honored, to be adhered to by all parties to the conflict. More than half [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=329.04s)]
*  of Gaza's hospitals right now are out of commission. Those that are working are only working partially. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=337.44s)]
*  Hospital workers over the past 12 months, as well as having to deal with the most horrific [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=344.4s)]
*  of injuries that they're tending to, have also had to evacuate, have had to pack up time and time [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=351.52s)]
*  again as a result of evacuation orders, as a result of fighting in and around where they are [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=357.44s)]
*  working and where they are situated. That's the first thing that we need. Hospitals also need [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=364.88s)]
*  equipment. They need supplies. They need fuel to power the generators that keep the ventilation [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=370.72s)]
*  units going and the intensive care units running so that people do not die. There was an evacuation [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  of children from one hospital in northern Gaza to another in Gaza City a couple of days ago, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=385.20000000000005s)]
*  and those children had to be transported in ambulances using manual ventilators, ventilators [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=391.6s)]
*  pumped by hand in the 21st century. So ultimately we need protection of these facilities. We need [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=397.76s)]
*  supplies. We need the workers to be protected as well, and all this is only really going to come [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=406.56s)]
*  with a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire. Sam, last week the UN commission released a report [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=411.76s)]
*  saying that it found war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israeli attacks on health facilities, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=420.64s)]
*  and I wonder from your perspective, being in Gaza, doing the work on the ground, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=425.6s)]
*  dealing with the realities of this war, whether you think the international community is going [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=428.8s)]
*  to step up to alleviate some of the harsh realities that can be fixed by supplying [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=433.6s)]
*  more resources and frankly more food into Gaza. I mean I'd certainly like to think so. The pressures [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=440.88s)]
*  that I'm under, that my staff, my colleagues, that health workers, that humanitarian aid workers [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=450.16s)]
*  across Gaza are under are absolutely unimaginable. If reports such as this, if commissions [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=456.08000000000004s)]
*  of inquiries such as this by some of the most respected bodies in the world are not respected, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=465.36s)]
*  are not listened to seriously, then that has impacts not just on how we work here as [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=471.92s)]
*  humanitarian workers, but how we work anywhere in any conflict around the world. If incidents can [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=478.96000000000004s)]
*  continue to occur with impunity, they will just provoke and prompt further escalations on both [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  sides with consequences right now for the people of Gaza, but as I say, broader consequences [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  anywhere in the world. If these frameworks, these international frameworks and legal frameworks that [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=500.56s)]
*  govern how we work, that govern the responsibility of member states of the United Nations to take [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=506.24s)]
*  action when there are allegations and concerns that they have been broken, if those aren't working [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=512.72s)]
*  then I mean we start to lose hope and hope is the one thing we really can't afford to lose [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=518.72s)]
*  in Gaza right now. We've lost a lot of it, but people are continuing and will continue and we are [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=526.0s)]
*  confident and adamant that this polio campaign has to be a success. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3S1fwxeSI8&t=532.4s)]
