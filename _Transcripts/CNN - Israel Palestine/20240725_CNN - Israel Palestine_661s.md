# Hear what VP Harris says she told Israel's Netanyahu
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU)
*  I told him that I will always ensure that Israel is able to defend itself, including [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=0.0s)]
*  from Iran and Iran-backed militias such as Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=6.48s)]
*  From when I was a young girl collecting funds to plant trees for Israel to my time in the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=12.74s)]
*  United States Senate and now at the White House, I have had an unwavering commitment [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  to the existence of the State of Israel, to its security and to the people of Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=24.1s)]
*  I've said it many times, but it bears repeating, Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=30.5s)]
*  And how it does so matters. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=37.58s)]
*  Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  On October 7, Hamas triggered this war when it massacred 1,200 innocent people, including [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=44.02s)]
*  44 Americans. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=52.14s)]
*  Hamas has committed horrific acts of sexual violence and took 250 hostages. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=54.58s)]
*  There are American citizens who remain captive in Gaza. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=61.94s)]
*  Sagi Dekohen, Hirsch Goldberg-Polen, Idan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Omer Nutra, and the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=66.62s)]
*  remains of American citizens Judy Weinstein, Gad Haggai, and Itai Hen are still being held [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=80.46s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  I have met with the families of these American hostages multiple times now, and I've told [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=91.41999999999999s)]
*  them each time they are not alone and I stand with them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=97.52s)]
*  And President Biden and I are working every day to bring them home. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=103.08s)]
*  I also expressed with the Prime Minister my serious concern about the scale of human suffering [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=108.98s)]
*  in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=115.78s)]
*  And I made clear my serious concern about the dire humanitarian situation there, with [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=122.53999999999999s)]
*  over 2 million people facing high levels of food insecurity and half a million people [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=129.3s)]
*  facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=136.82s)]
*  What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=142.58s)]
*  The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  displaced for the second, third, or fourth time. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=155.02s)]
*  We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=160.06s)]
*  We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=163.56s)]
*  Thanks to the leadership of our President Joe Biden, there is a deal on the table for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  a ceasefire and a hostage deal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=176.12s)]
*  And it is important that we recall what the deal involves. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=179.48s)]
*  The first phase of the deal would bring about a full ceasefire, including a withdrawal of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=184.12s)]
*  the Israeli military from population centers in Gaza. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=190.08s)]
*  In the second phase, the Israeli military would withdraw from Gaza entirely, and it [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=194.8s)]
*  would lead to a permanent end to the hostilities. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=200.84s)]
*  It is time for this war to end, and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=214.0s)]
*  exercise their right to freedom, dignity, and self-determination. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=220.52s)]
*  There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=227.24s)]
*  And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=232.84s)]
*  So to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=239.04s)]
*  peace, I see you and I hear you. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=244.56s)]
*  Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=249.44s)]
*  Let's bring the hostages home, and let's provide much needed relief to the Palestinian people. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=254.64s)]
*  And ultimately, I remain committed to a path forward that can lead to a two-state solution. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=262.68s)]
*  And I know right now it is hard to conceive of that prospect, but a two-state solution [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=270.6s)]
*  is the only path that ensures Israel remains a secure Jewish and democratic state, and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=277.04s)]
*  one that ensures Palestinians can finally realize the freedom, security, and prosperity [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=284.62s)]
*  that they rightly deserve. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=291.16s)]
*  And I will close with this then. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=294.24s)]
*  It is important for the American people to remember the war in Gaza is not a binary issue. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  However, too often the conversation is binary, when the reality is anything but. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  So I ask my fellow Americans to help encourage efforts to acknowledge the complexity, the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=311.16s)]
*  nuance, and the history of the region. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=318.12s)]
*  Let us all condemn terrorism and violence. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=322.12s)]
*  Let us all do what we can to prevent the suffering of innocent civilians. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=326.04s)]
*  And let us condemn anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and hate of any kind. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=331.96s)]
*  And let us work to unite our country. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=340.12s)]
*  I thank you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=343.24s)]
*  Madam Vice President, after your meeting, are you convinced that the prime minister [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=344.36s)]
*  would like a peace-fire deal? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, there you heard Vice President Harris, as well as presidential candidate [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  Harris, as of this week, talking after meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  Israel, saying Israel has a right to defend itself, but we cannot allow ourselves to be [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=362.72s)]
*  numb to the suffering in Gaza. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=367.16s)]
*  She said it is time for the war to end, and she conveyed that to Benjamin Netanyahu as [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=369.24s)]
*  well. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=374.72s)]
*  Let's bring in Kayla Tausche from the White House. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=375.72s)]
*  Kayla, some strong words there from the vice president after her meeting, and it obviously [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=377.52s)]
*  is coming at an interesting political moment for her as well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=382.72s)]
*  Pam, it's been the clearest distillation yet that we've seen of Vice President Harris's [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=386.08s)]
*  own belief and views on this situation, and I think there's one line in particular that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  And that is toward the top when she said Israel has a right to defend itself and how it does [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=396.76s)]
*  so matters. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=401.76s)]
*  She's speaking to those who want to see Israel defend itself and want this war to end and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=403.56s)]
*  also those who want to seek peace. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=409.8s)]
*  And she says in no uncertain terms, I hear you and I see you, to those on all sides of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=412.0s)]
*  this argument and this debate that has inflamed divisions in this country as well as around [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=418.68s)]
*  the world. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=424.36s)]
*  Pam, those forceful words and perhaps the clearest position that's been laid out on [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=425.96000000000004s)]
*  this situation from this administration so far and certainly from the vice president [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=430.36s)]
*  herself. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=434.56s)]
*  And it's worth noting that because in listening to some of her comments up until this point, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=435.56s)]
*  aides of hers, administration officials, and those who know her very well have noted that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  substantively she's not different from President Biden on this topic, but tonally, rhetorically [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=446.0s)]
*  She is that she has a tendency to speak more forcefully on this issues that at times has [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=451.96s)]
*  raised eyebrows inside the White House. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=456.64s)]
*  But then when you look at the substance of the remarks, they're actually not that different. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=458.46s)]
*  She is now at a crossroads where she has to decide what her nuance is on this issue, whether [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  she wants to break from Biden's position or whether she wants to stay the course with [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=467.64s)]
*  what the administration has laid out fulsomely so far. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=472.42s)]
*  Appears to be her saying this is where I'm going to be on this matter, that Israel has [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=477.16s)]
*  a right to defend itself and how it does so matters and that for people on all sides of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=483.04s)]
*  this debate that she hears them and she sees them. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  Pam, all right, Kayla Towsche, thank you so much. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=490.24s)]
*  And for more reaction, Vice President Harris's comments, I want to bring in Democratic congressman [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  Jason Crow Colorado. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=496.8s)]
*  First off, what is your reaction? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=499.16s)]
*  What we just heard from Harris? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=500.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, I agree with your colleague that the line that we support Israel, but how it does [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=502.0s)]
*  so matter, that is a key element to this, that we can both stand with Israel and help [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=509.52s)]
*  it defend itself, but it has to do so consistent with its values, that the level of civilian [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=516.0s)]
*  casualties has been unacceptable and untenable. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=521.68s)]
*  And the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is also not aligned with our values and our interests. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=525.24s)]
*  And then finally, her calling on the American people to embrace the complexity of the situation [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=530.88s)]
*  in the history here is also really important. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=536.16s)]
*  We have to be able to have that confidence to have that conversation. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=538.76s)]
*  Was this a stronger stance on Palestinian suffering in Gaza than we have heard from [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=543.6s)]
*  President Biden in almost 10 months of this war, in your view? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=548.92s)]
*  Now I wouldn't compare it to President Biden. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=553.92s)]
*  President Biden has handled this in a very complicated and a very strong way, but she's clearly [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=556.48s)]
*  articulating her views on this and saying that we need to have a conversation going forward [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=562.4s)]
*  about the complexity by calling on the release of the hostages, saying that we have to find [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=567.08s)]
*  a path forward to peace. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=572.12s)]
*  This conflict has evolved and has evolved from day one to day 270 now at this point. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=574.2s)]
*  We have to make sure that we're evolving in our conversation along the lines. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=582.32s)]
*  Earlier this week, her campaign said that it was still defining her stance over the war. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=585.72s)]
*  You heard Harris say how Israel prosecutes this war matters. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=591.84s)]
*  You just talked about that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=596.1600000000001s)]
*  Does that signal to you that she could substantially change her policy toward Israel compared to [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=597.6s)]
*  Biden, using more leverage against Netanyahu's government, especially considering she's now [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=603.6s)]
*  a presidential candidate? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=608.44s)]
*  I think what it means is that she is going to continue to adapt as the circumstances change. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=610.72s)]
*  What I learned in war, I served as an Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan, is that day one is [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=616.52s)]
*  different from day 90 and different from day 180. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=622.0s)]
*  Wars and conditions change. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=626.08s)]
*  And as a leader, you have to have the ability to be able to adapt to those changing conditions. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  So she very clearly conveyed a desire to actually understand what's going on and to adapt as [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=634.0s)]
*  necessary going forward and to embrace, again, that complexity of the situation here, that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7eNeon9vKU&t=641.2s)]
