*  Yeah, John, the US is really trying [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  to send a very strong message here [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  to Iran and its proxies to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=29.76s)]
*  essentially back off in the way [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=31.68s)]

*  signaling that they are sending [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=41.480000000000004s)]

*  something that is extremely rare for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  the Pentagon to actually announce. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=48.8s)]
*  Usually these submarines operate [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=50.6s)]
*  in relative secrecy and so to announce [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  that this submarine which is armed [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=54.6s)]

*  is prepared to act on behalf of the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=67.24s)]
*  Israelis to defend the Israelis. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  If Iran decides to launch an attack [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=71.47999999999999s)]

*  the US has also announced that it [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=76.08s)]

*  to the region following this call that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Secretary Austin had with Israeli [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=94.44000000000001s)]
*  Defense Minister Yoav Galant. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=96.68s)]
*  All of these deployments were made [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  public last night following that call [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=99.68s)]
*  in which Austin reiterated to the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Israeli Defense Minister that the US [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=104.44s)]
*  is prepared to do whatever it takes [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=106.12s)]
*  to defend its ally. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=108.84s)]
*  Now, of course, this all comes as the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  region is bracing for this retaliation [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=111.84s)]
*  by Iran following the Israeli [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  or presumed Israeli assassination [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=116.68s)]
*  of Hamas's most senior political leader [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  in Tehran earlier this month. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=122.64s)]
*  It has been really widely expected [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=125.04s)]
*  that Iran was going to retaliate somehow. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=127.12s)]
*  Really, no one knows exactly when or how [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  that is going to happen but the Pentagon, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=132.32s)]
*  now placing a number of very strategic [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=134.4s)]
*  assets in the region to try to calm tensions [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=136.96s)]
*  but also of course be prepared to help [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=139.36s)]
*  Israel respond if necessary, John. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  A region on edge this morning. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=143.76000000000002s)]
*  Natasha Bertrand, thank you very much. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=145.68s)]
*  US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=147.36s)]
*  has ordered a guided missile submarine [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  to the Middle East as fears grow [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=151.8s)]
*  of a potential attack on Israel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  Meanwhile, another barrage of rockets [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  fired from Lebanon into Israel overnight [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=158.28s)]
*  has further heightened tensions in the region. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=160.84s)]
*  Hezbollah says it was in support [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=163.84s)]
*  of the Palestinian people and in retaliation [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=165.24s)]
*  for Israel's strikes in southern Lebanon. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  This all comes just days ahead of Gaza's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=170.88s)]
*  ceasefire talks due to take place [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  on Thursday. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=174.88s)]
*  A source says that according to mediators, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  newly appointed Hamas political leader [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=179.52s)]
*  Yaya Sinwar wants a deal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=181.52s)]
*  We have team coverage, CNN's international [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=184.6s)]
*  diplomatic editor Nick Robertson is in Tel Aviv [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=186.6s)]
*  and CNN's senior international correspondent [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  Ben Wiedemann with the latest from Beirut. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  Nick, let's start with you. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=194.28s)]
*  And first, a word that we're hearing [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  from the new Hamas leader, Yaya Sinwar, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=198.72s)]
*  that he wants a ceasefire deal. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=200.8s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=203.88s)]
*  It seems to be a way of putting pressure [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=207.84s)]
*  on Israel and potentially putting pressure [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=210.4s)]
*  on President Biden in the White House [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=212.72s)]
*  to put pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=215.12s)]
*  to make some compromises in the talks over Gaza, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=217.96s)]
*  compromises that he hasn't been prepared [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=222.84s)]
*  to partake in before. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=224.76s)]
*  And the reason for this pressure [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=227.68s)]
*  and the reason for the positioning [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=229.8s)]
*  and the reason that these talks [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=231.36s)]
*  on Thursday are so critical [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  because it's not just about Gaza. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  This was put into play, if you will, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  these talks on Thursday to try to convince Iran [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=239.6s)]
*  that there was a plausible Gaza ceasefire deal [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  in the works and therefore not to retaliate [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=246.48s)]
*  at an escalatory level against Israel. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=249.16s)]
*  But when you see the US Secretary of Defense [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=251.72s)]
*  moving additional military assets, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=254.48s)]
*  speeding them into the region, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=257.8s)]
*  moving the USS Georgia, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  this nuclear-powered cruise missile-firing submarine [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  from the Mediterranean into the Eastern Mediterranean, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=268.36s)]
*  those are signals that the US believes [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=272.16s)]
*  that there is the potential [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  that the talks won't go well this week [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=276.8s)]
*  and therefore that Iran may strike [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=279.68s)]
*  or they may interpret the fact [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=282.24s)]
*  that the talks are really not gonna be any different [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=283.8s)]
*  to anything in the past. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=285.52s)]
*  And may interpret that as a signal [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=286.72s)]
*  that they may as well go [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=290.64s)]
*  and have their retaliatory strike against Israel. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=291.8s)]
*  So all of these features right now, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=294.44s)]
*  I think focus on how important those talks are, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=298.92s)]
*  focus how tenuous they are. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=301.6s)]
*  Diplomats that I'm talking to in the region [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=303.68s)]
*  who had some hope late last week [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=306.12s)]
*  that a deal could be reached on Thursday [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=309.08s)]
*  are now worrying that that can't happen [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  and part of it is, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=315.04s)]
*  and this is Hamas' position as well, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  that they are not clear what Prime Minister [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=318.88s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is going to do, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=321.56s)]
*  what he'll tell his officials to do at those talks. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  That's the concern. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  So while Hamas says it wants a deal, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=330.08s)]
*  it's also saying that it's not prepared [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  to go to the talks at the moment. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=335.88s)]
*  This is in a very, very delicate situation. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it sure is. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=341.24s)]
*  And in terms of the timeline, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=342.44s)]
*  we've been talking so much about when. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  It's not a matter of if, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=346.64s)]
*  but when Iran will retaliate against the killing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  of its top Hamas leader in recent days. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  CNN analyst Barack Ravid reported Sunday [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=355.15999999999997s)]
*  that two sources say Israeli intelligence [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=357.84s)]
*  has assessed Iran could be planning an attack within days. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  And obviously it does seem, I guess, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  more imminent with the military posture that we're seeing. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=368.2s)]
*  Absolutely, the military posture [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=373.68s)]
*  by the United States tells you that that threat is real [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=375.16s)]
*  and is potentially imminent. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=378.6s)]
*  Diplomatic sources that I'm talking to say [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=380.48s)]
*  that the hope was that Iran would have a retaliatory strike [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=383.04s)]
*  that was in the limits of the conventions of warfare, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=387.56s)]
*  not striking at civilians, striking at military bases, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=391.04s)]
*  and therefore wouldn't cause an escalation. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=393.88s)]
*  But that cannot be ruled out at the moment. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=396.64s)]
*  In diplomatic terms, diplomats are looking at this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=401.32s)]
*  and they can see what's happening in Iran. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  A new president who's not particularly well-bedded in, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=407.36s)]
*  who is perhaps under pressure from hardliners, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=411.0s)]
*  they'll see the former foreign minister resigning [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=414.72s)]
*  from his government position as a symbol [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=417.32s)]
*  that the more moderates feel that the hardliners [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=420.16s)]
*  are on the ascendancy in Tehran at the moment. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=423.92s)]
*  So that sense that Iran could do something [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  that is more escalatory or potentially escalatory [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=430.88s)]
*  is very, very real. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=434.44s)]
*  It is more on the table now than it felt [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=436.4s)]
*  at the end of last week [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=439.88s)]
*  when there were still hopes about the talks. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=441.32s)]
*  But the atmosphere around those talks is not positive [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  and is not conducive to a positive or quick outcome. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=447.32s)]
*  And that was what it was going to take for Iran to be deterred [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=450.55999999999995s)]
*  from any escalatory type action. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  Some really significant context from you there, Nick, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=457.72s)]
*  and Tel Aviv, Nick, thank you so much for that. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=460.92s)]
*  Ben, let's head over to you in Beirut. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=463.04s)]
*  And as you were saying, Hezbollah reportedly fired [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=464.68s)]
*  some 30 rockets from Lebanon toward Israel. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=467.68s)]
*  What is the atmosphere like there in Lebanon? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  And I mean, you've been there for some time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=474.16s)]
*  How serious is this as an escalation? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=477.16s)]
*  Well, what we saw yesterday was really just more of the same. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=483.0s)]
*  There has been an incremental escalation or increase [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  by Hezbollah in the amount of attacks it's launching on Israel. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=491.12s)]
*  Though keep in mind that according to one study, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=495.40000000000003s)]
*  for every one attack Hezbollah launches, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  there are six Israeli counter strikes. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=501.04s)]
*  Now, today so far, there have only been two claimed, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  two strikes claimed by Hamas. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=508.24s)]
*  So sort of every day is different, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=510.16s)]
*  but certainly these strikes are really within the context [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=512.6s)]
*  of what we've seen going back to the 8th of October, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=517.04s)]
*  when Hezbollah first opened fire on Israel. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=519.64s)]
*  What, of course, everybody is anticipating, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=523.7199999999999s)]
*  expecting, fearing to some extent, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=526.68s)]
*  is Hezbollah responding to the strike Tuesday before last [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=530.0s)]
*  by Israel that killed a senior Hezbollah commander. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=534.4s)]
*  Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah has said [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=538.68s)]
*  that that response to that assassination is coming. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=541.92s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=546.12s)]
*  The question is, what form will it take? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=548.04s)]
*  And speaking to my diplomatic sources, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=551.6s)]
*  they do feel that Hezbollah sort of talked itself [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=554.84s)]
*  into a corner that, you know, it has to respond, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=557.88s)]
*  but if it responds too strongly, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=561.44s)]
*  the Israeli counter response could be very destructive [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=563.68s)]
*  beyond simply the area along the border [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=568.4s)]
*  that has been steadily pounded now going back to October. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=571.2s)]
*  So in terms of the atmosphere here, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=575.56s)]
*  what we're seeing is that out of the last six days, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=577.96s)]
*  Israeli warplanes have broken the sound barrier [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=581.3199999999999s)]
*  four of those days. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=585.4399999999999s)]
*  We're seeing that more airlines are extending [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=587.48s)]
*  their suspensions of flights to Beirut. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=590.12s)]
*  The latest one is Swissair, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=592.92s)]
*  which has suspended its flights to Lebanon [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=594.96s)]
*  until the 21st of August. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=598.4s)]
*  But when you go out into the street, you go to restaurants, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=600.96s)]
*  there's still people there, perhaps less than before [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=604.48s)]
*  because many have left. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  But I think as I've said time and time again on CNN, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=609.24s)]
*  people here have been on this roller coaster [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=614.72s)]
*  where we've seen escalations, deescalations [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=617.84s)]
*  time and time again. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=620.96s)]
*  So in a sense, they're prepared for the worst, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=622.6s)]
*  but they have no choice but to go about their daily lives [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  as best they can. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YQb-DcQ4mQ&t=630.84s)]
