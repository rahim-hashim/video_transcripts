# Retired colonel points out key difficulty Israeli troops would face in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E)
*  Well, the Israel Defense Forces say that they are currently conducting what they're calling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=0.0s)]
*  a large-scale strike on terror targets belonging to Hamas and Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=4.3s)]
*  That is, the top U.S. diplomat is in Israel, and the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford has now [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=10.48s)]
*  moved into the region. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=15.82s)]
*  The Israeli forces are masked along the border with Gaza, and there's so many questions now [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=17.68s)]
*  happening of what comes next. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=22.12s)]
*  And the real question is, how could the next phase of this conflict unfold? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=23.68s)]
*  I want to bring in CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=28.84s)]
*  Also Director James Clapper is also back. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=33.84s)]
*  He's a retired Air Force Lieutenant General. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=35.92s)]
*  Colonel Leighton, I'll begin with you because I'm trying to understand, what do we know [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=38.4s)]
*  about where the Israeli troops are moving, and then what might be coming? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=43.88s)]
*  Yeah, Laura, that's a great question. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=48.2s)]
*  Tonight we have about 300,000 Israeli reservists that are actually deployed on the border. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=50.2s)]
*  And so where are they actually? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=56.56s)]
*  Well, this is probably a pretty good indication. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Right around all of these areas right here is where you will find Israeli troops concentrated. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=61.84s)]
*  And what are they concentrating with? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=68.72s)]
*  Well, equipment like these tanks right here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=70.64s)]
*  They have tanks, armored personnel carriers, and other equipment that they can potentially [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=73.12s)]
*  use to go into Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=77.28s)]
*  And that, I think, is going to make a big difference in what they could potentially [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=79.80000000000001s)]
*  do with some kind of ground incursion on their part. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=84.56s)]
*  It's hard for most people to imagine just how densely populated Gaza is. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=88.32s)]
*  I mean, just we've heard about it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  We've been hearing about comparisons that are drawn. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=94.32s)]
*  Tell me about the impact of that on the next phase of a potential ground incursion. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a very interesting area as well, Laura, because the most densely populated [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=102.84s)]
*  part of Gaza is the city of Gaza itself. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=107.8s)]
*  So that's this part right here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=110.56s)]
*  That has over 25,000 people per square mile. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=112.68s)]
*  Other areas like North Gaza, Derelbala, Khan Yunis, which is a major refugee camp, and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=117.36s)]
*  Rafa have less population densities. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=122.84s)]
*  But still, everything in Gaza is basically, with a little bit of an exception, 10,000 [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=125.52s)]
*  people or more per square mile. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=131.08s)]
*  So you think of a lot of people that are packed into a very small area. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=133.12s)]
*  And just by comparison, there are places that have higher population density per square [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=138.4s)]
*  mile around the world, but Gaza has more population density per square mile, about 21,000 people [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=143.12s)]
*  per square mile in the urban areas compared to Tel Aviv, Los Angeles, or here in the Washington, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  D.C. area. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=155.08s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=156.08s)]
*  When you look at that comparison, it really drives home the point of just how densely [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=157.08s)]
*  populated. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=160.84s)]
*  And also, what would take place if you had troops moving into those areas. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=161.84s)]
*  This is civilians we're talking about in those areas in particular. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=166.2s)]
*  So the U.S. has moved assets into the region. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  What role could U.S. firepower play, if any, going forward? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=173.0s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of things that we would have to contend with here, and one of them [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=176.72s)]
*  are the dense streets. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=180.72s)]
*  So you look at how narrow things are. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=182.26s)]
*  This is what General Clapper and I would call battle damage assessment. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  A perfect video for that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=188.64s)]
*  You see what damage has been done here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=190.5s)]
*  But look how cavernous all of this is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=192.56s)]
*  Look at all the different buildings and look at how difficult it would be to maneuver something [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=194.82s)]
*  through each and every one of these streets. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=199.73999999999998s)]
*  So a lot of things that would be coming into the area include deliveries of munitions, like [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  you see here from this Israeli cargo jet. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=206.82s)]
*  You have the USS Gerald R. Ford with its aircraft, 70 to 90 aircraft, depending on how they did [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  the carrier battle group. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=216.45999999999998s)]
*  And you've got them coming into the Eastern Mediterranean, along with Air Force F-35s [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=218.16s)]
*  and F-15s, as well as the F-10s. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=223.74s)]
*  All of those play a huge part in putting the U.S. presence in this area and making sure [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=225.94s)]
*  that this conflict doesn't go any further than it really has already. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=231.56s)]
*  Colonel Layton, it's so important to think about, and just seeing all that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=238.06s)]
*  Director Clapper, I want to ask you about what we've been seeing from Colonel Layton, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=240.62s)]
*  because that population density, there are hostages likely in Gaza. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=245.86s)]
*  You don't know where they are. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=252.22s)]
*  You see what is ahead in trying to move ground troops into that area. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=254.2s)]
*  What strikes you as the most difficult aspect of trying to get people out and stop? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=259.52s)]
*  A very compressed geography, very crowded urbanized terrain, urban terrain. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=265.56s)]
*  So you wonder how, given that sort of situation, how are they going to move all that heavy [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=276.04s)]
*  equipment, those tanks down these very narrow streets that are in the Gaza. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=283.0s)]
*  So the question that comes to my mind is, what rules of engagement is the Israeli Ministry [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=287.2s)]
*  of Defense and the IDF chief instructing or providing to these troops? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  How exactly do they conduct themselves if and when they actually enter into the Gaza? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=301.36s)]
*  They've got so many things to consider here. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=308.56s)]
*  A very difficult terrain to start with. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=311.72s)]
*  They operate equipment even in a passive environment, or benign environment, which this is not. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  They've got to contend with booby traps, IEDs, snipers, plus the presence of a very dense [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=321.16s)]
*  civilian population. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=329.44s)]
*  And also to be considered are the location of the hostages, probably dispersed widely, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=331.64s)]
*  probably underground. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=339.96s)]
*  So what I wonder about is the operations order that is being issued to or will be issued [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=342.08s)]
*  to the Israeli attacking force and what the rules of engagement are on how they are to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  conduct those operations mindful of all these factors. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=357.44s)]
*  There's so much to consider and we're going to continue to unpack. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=360.44s)]
*  Colonel Hildegladin, thank you so much. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=363.24s)]
*  Director Clapper. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ROkhm2c5E&t=364.76s)]
