# Multiple explosions in Rafah after evacuation orders. Military analyst explains the implications
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg)
*  Breaking news, Israeli forces are just hours away from taking over the Palestinian side [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=0.0s)]
*  of the Ra'afah crossing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=5.54s)]
*  This is according to longtime Israeli reporter Barak Ravid. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=7.16s)]
*  Palestinian news outlets reporting that Israeli forces are shelling the area from the air [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=10.82s)]
*  and with artillery fire. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=14.74s)]
*  Tanks are also moving in. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=16.38s)]
*  This, of course, is where so many civilians have sought refuge during this terrifying [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=17.38s)]
*  and horrible conflict. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=22.54s)]
*  In Gaza, they'd gone to Ra'afah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=24.18s)]
*  This comes even as Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire proposal earlier today, but the Israeli prime [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=26.18s)]
*  minister's office responded saying, quote, even though Hamas' proposal is far from Israel's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=31.2s)]
*  necessary requirements, Israel will send a working-level delegation to the mediators. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=35.84s)]
*  But meantime, obviously, this assault is launching regardless. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=41.44s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond is with me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=44.96s)]
*  He is in Jerusalem tonight. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=46.16s)]
*  So Jeremy, just to get a sense of while these back and forths are happening, there appears [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=47.92s)]
*  to be significant movement in Ra'afah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=52.66s)]
*  What is happening is best you understand it right now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=54.98s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=57.419999999999995s)]
*  I mean, we are seeing very dramatic video of explosions lighting up the night sky in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=58.419999999999995s)]
*  Ra'afah, but this appears to be more than just the airstrikes that we have watched over [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=64.56s)]
*  the course of the last seven months of this war, including in Ra'afah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=68.58s)]
*  Instead, it appears that the Israeli military, according to our analyst Barak Ravid, that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=72.62s)]
*  into Ra'afah with ground forces in order to take over that Ra'afah border crossing, which [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=79.14s)]
*  happens to be along the Egypt-Gaza border, known here critically as the Philadelphia [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=86.14s)]
*  route, which is a very strategic route between Egypt and Gaza, where the Israeli military [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=92.7s)]
*  believes a lot of Hamas smuggling operations also take place. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=97.58s)]
*  It's not clear exactly the scope of this operation at this point, but it is notable, of course, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=102.54s)]
*  that it comes less than 24 hours after the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=108.7s)]
*  of Palestinian civilians living in eastern Ra'afah, about 100,000 of them, to begin evacuating [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=113.82000000000001s)]
*  that area. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=120.10000000000001s)]
*  And now, less than 24 hours later, it appears that not only is the Israeli military carrying [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  out strikes in eastern Ra'afah, but also apparently moving in ground forces, including tanks. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=125.38s)]
*  So not clear what this spells out for the future of a major ground offensive in Ra'afah, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=132.4s)]
*  but at least for now it appears that that operation has begun to a certain level. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=137.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=141.48s)]
*  The issue here, of course, though, is the civilians, as we talked about, Jeremy. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=142.48s)]
*  We all know that is Ra'afah has been where civilians were told to go for safety from [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=145.78s)]
*  the very beginning of this war. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  And for months, the United States has warned Israel against attacking on Ra'afah because [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=152.6s)]
*  of civilian casualties. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  And yet, the leaflets we see today on video being dropped in eastern Ra'afah are ordering [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=158.16s)]
*  civilians to flee north, which, of course, WHO has said is in the midst of a mass famine, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  such that there's even anything left in the north of Gaza. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=171.56s)]
*  A deep irony in that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=174.44s)]
*  What are you hearing on the ground about evacuation efforts for civilians? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=176.0s)]
*  Well, it appears that thousands of civilians did indeed begin to heed those warnings earlier [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=180.6s)]
*  today, although it was also causing quite a widespread sense of panic throughout Ra'afah, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  not only in the areas where they are being told to evacuate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=191.23999999999998s)]
*  And when the Israeli military says go north, they aren't telling them to go all the way [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=194.12s)]
*  to northern Gaza, but north of Ra'afah to the Almawasi area, where they've set up a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  humanitarian zone, as well as an expanded humanitarian zone, as they call it, in western [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=201.76s)]
*  Khan Yunis, where they say they brought in tents, shelter, food, medicine. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  But humanitarian aid officials say that the conditions there simply aren't enough to accommodate [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  the number of people in Ra'afah, particularly if the panic spreads throughout the city in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=215.32s)]
*  terms of the tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people who could very soon [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=220.8s)]
*  begin to flood there. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=225.32s)]
*  And I anticipate that as these strikes and this ground operation is beginning to happen [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=226.66s)]
*  this evening, tomorrow you will see an even larger movement of people fleeing north. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  And of course, the contrast of all of this is the fact that earlier this evening we were [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  seeing images of Gazans celebrating as this news of Hamas accepting a ceasefire proposal, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=240.04s)]
*  as they have termed it, began to spread. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  People began celebrating. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=249.0s)]
*  But of course, now we have learned that this proposal that Hamas accepted is not the same [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=250.0s)]
*  one that Israel helped craft with Egypt. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=254.48s)]
*  Israel still saying that it doesn't meet their core demands. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=257.08s)]
*  They are sending a delegation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  But it is clear that there is still a lot of ground to be made up between these two [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=261.38s)]
*  sides. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  And they continue to move on Ra'afah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=266.08000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=267.88s)]
*  Thank you very much, Jeremy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=268.88s)]
*  I want to go now to retired Army Major General James Spider-Marks. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=269.88s)]
*  So General Marks, Israel pushing ahead with its assault on Ra'afah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=273.32s)]
*  At this point, what is the military objective of an operation like this? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=277.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, first of all, Israel, I think, has from the outset indicated that Ra'afah is a legitimate [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=282.56s)]
*  target for them and that there was certain inevitability to this operation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=288.76s)]
*  The objective, clearly, is for Israel, for the IDF forces to continue the mission to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=293.72s)]
*  go after two things, infrastructure as well as Hamas leadership and Hamas fighters. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  Now, bear in mind, over this, what I would say, period, this interregnum of a couple [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=305.36s)]
*  of weeks, Israel has been doing significant intelligence collection in terms of where [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  are those pieces of infrastructure they need to go after and where are the fighters as [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=316.0s)]
*  well. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=320.72s)]
*  But also, what they've been doing is they've been trying to assess what it is in terms [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=321.9s)]
*  of the best routes in and where you want to try to isolate the fight. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  You just don't go rushing into Ra'afah and then not have some type of controlled exit. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=332.14s)]
*  Clearly, the exit into Egypt, Egypt is not going to allow that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=337.82s)]
*  So the movement north, what Israel is primarily concerned about. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=341.78s)]
*  So that's what's going to take place. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=346.23999999999995s)]
*  And I would tell you that most of the Hamas fighters as well over this period have been [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  able to do some additional preparation as well as in many cases, I would suspect, escaping [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=351.1s)]
*  from the kill zone. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  So General, what do you read into this in the context of the most important ally to [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=358.26000000000005s)]
*  Israel and certainly in a world where it has become increasingly isolated, its most important [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=364.22s)]
*  ally, the United States has repeatedly said, the president has repeatedly said, you don't [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=368.94s)]
*  go into Ra'afah unless there is a true humanitarian process and that that is completely built [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=374.3s)]
*  up. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=380.46s)]
*  Obviously, aid organizations are saying very clearly that it isn't. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=381.46s)]
*  So what do you make of the fact that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going ahead and doing [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=384.38s)]
*  this in spite of very clear U.S. admonitions not to? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=387.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to be crude, but I think it's a matter of Netanyahu playing a little [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=392.9s)]
*  bit of chicken. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=398.9s)]
*  He realizes that the job is not completed until Ra'afah is cleared. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=399.9s)]
*  And I think many would agree that that has to take place. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=404.26s)]
*  Let's be frank. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=407.41999999999996s)]
*  Hamas is an ideology. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=408.42s)]
*  It is going to continue to grow. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=410.42s)]
*  You've got to be able to kill leadership as it exists right now. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=413.82s)]
*  But Hamas will, in many cases, we would expect to see it again in some form. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  You want to buy yourself some time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=422.20000000000005s)]
*  So Netanyahu is essentially telling President Biden, look, I got it, but I have to complete [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=423.70000000000005s)]
*  this job. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=429.94s)]
*  And he's, as I said, he's playing chicken. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=431.02000000000004s)]
*  He's going to see whether this administration is going to stop providing the support, both [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=432.70000000000005s)]
*  diplomatically, that type of top cover, as well as the military support. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=437.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=441.02s)]
*  To see whether they will really stop it, whether they'll pull the plug, stop something. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=442.02s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=445.34s)]
*  It's a crucial test. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=446.34s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf7EZ8aNDHg&t=447.34s)]
