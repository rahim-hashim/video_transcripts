# Exclusive: CNN meets Israeli troops as tensions rise on Lebanon border
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE)
*  Over the last 24 hours or so, there has been intensifying exchanges of fire between Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=0.0s)]
*  and Hezbollah militants that operate inside Lebanon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=6.28s)]
*  Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that gets support from Iran but operates as a quasi [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=9.64s)]
*  governmental force really inside the borders of Lebanon. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=15.56s)]
*  They've been going back and forth with Israel over the last seven days. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=19.52s)]
*  United Nations peacekeepers who operate inside southern Lebanon say that their headquarters [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=23.72s)]
*  was hit by a wayward rocket. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=28.64s)]
*  Luckily no one was hurt there but it gives you a sense of the situation along that border [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=30.44s)]
*  with Israel now saying that people who live within two kilometers of that border should [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=35.64s)]
*  evacuate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=40.56s)]
*  28 villages concerned. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=41.56s)]
*  Our Matthew Chance is in northern Israel not far from that border right now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=43.4s)]
*  Matthew, give us the situation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, a very tense situation up here close to the Lebanese border. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Within the past few hours, the Israeli military has ordered 28 Israeli communities to evacuate [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=56.92s)]
*  from their positions very close to that frontier with Lebanon. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=62.64s)]
*  That's in process now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=67.48s)]
*  That follows a string of cross-border attacks that have been taking place over the course [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=69.28s)]
*  of the past 24 hours or in fact even longer than that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=74.2s)]
*  Nine rocket attacks according to the Israeli defense forces over the course of the past [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=77.36s)]
*  24 hours. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=82.6s)]
*  They've responded to that with airstrikes and artillery strikes, some of which we could [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=83.88s)]
*  hear being launched from very close to this location here, close to the Lebanese border. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  We were also able though to gain some access to that exclusion zone close to the border. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=95.12s)]
*  It's actually four kilometers, about two and a half miles back from the border that they've [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=100.08s)]
*  now said is off limits to Israeli civilians. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=104.72s)]
*  They gave us access and showed us where basically the front lines were. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=108.24s)]
*  It's also the place, remember, which could really turn this conflict inside Israel into [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=114.16s)]
*  a much broader regional war. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  It's a very dangerous tipping point here in northern Israel still. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=122.88s)]
*  All the civilians that we talk to, most of them at least, the soldiers, the politicians [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=127.28s)]
*  that I've been in contact with as well, they are so enraged, so angry at what happened [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza last weekend that they say they are ready even bristling for a fight with Hezbollah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen to what one Israeli commander told me right close to the Lebanese border. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=145.2s)]
*  Are you hopeful still that Hezbollah will stay out of this war? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=150.2s)]
*  I hope there will be another front. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=156.92s)]
*  We need to destroy Hezbollah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  You hope there will be another front. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=161.44s)]
*  You want the war. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=162.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=163.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=164.88s)]
*  What Hamas did in Gaza, it didn't come from nowhere. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=165.88s)]
*  It came from Hezbollah. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=170.8s)]
*  It came from Iran. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=171.8s)]
*  And in order for us to stop what happened from Hamas, we need to stop them also. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=174.84s)]
*  Yeah, John, and the big difference now, of course, is that for some reason the Israeli [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=179.36s)]
*  military were not ready during the Gaza attacks. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  They are very ready up here in the north of the country. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=189.24s)]
*  Matthew is really extraordinary to see him pointing right there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  It gives you a sense of how close they are. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=195.12s)]
*  He was merely just pointing a little bit north to where Hezbollah operates with his extremely [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  powerful and well-trained militias. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  Matthew Chance in northern Israel, please stay safe. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=204.08s)]
*  U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken is back in Israel today. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=206.32000000000002s)]
*  He's been in the region, traveling all throughout the region for days now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=211.08s)]
*  We're standing by to see if Blinken will speak to reporters this hour. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=215.52s)]
*  A critical update potentially coming from him, given the news that you just reported, John. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  The IDF offered this also, the sobering update on the hostages taken by Hamas terrorists. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=222.88s)]
*  They now believe 199 people are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=228.6s)]
*  They've also said over the weekend that some may have been killed in transit, if you will, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=234.27999999999997s)]
*  during the trip from Israel into Gaza. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=239.56s)]
*  Sarah Seidner is right now in Haifa, Israel, where U.S. evacuations are underway. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=243.07999999999998s)]
*  Hey, Sarah. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=248.68s)]
*  Hey, Kate and John. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=252.56s)]
*  It's good to see you guys there safe and sound. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=255.12s)]
*  We are safe and sound at the moment here in Haifa, Israel, where we have just watched in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  the last two hours a huge ship taking away Americans out of the danger zone and into [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=263.0s)]
*  Cyprus. We'll get to that in just a minute. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=269.24s)]
*  But first, I want to go to our Jeremy Diamond, who has been tracking the whereabouts and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=270.52s)]
*  the conversations that Anthony Blinken has been having, the Secretary of State here for [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  the second time in just a week as Israel prepares for a potential ground war with Gaza and as [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=280.12s)]
*  this war rages on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=287.32000000000005s)]
*  What can you tell us, Jeremy, about the plans here, what Secretary Blinken is doing back [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=289.36s)]
*  here, again, why it was so important for him to show up in this country a second time in [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=294.16s)]
*  such a short amount of time? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=299.44000000000005s)]
*  Well, Sarah, just to give you a sense of how fluid the situation on the ground is right [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=302.92s)]
*  now, the secretary of even the reporters traveling with the secretary of state really haven't [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=307.76s)]
*  had a clear sense of exactly who he's been meeting with and when, although we did just [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=312.2s)]
*  get a readout from the secretary of state spokesman that he did indeed meet with the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  Israeli prime minister as well as the president of Israel, Isaac Herzog. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=321.04s)]
*  And in these readouts, we don't have a ton of details, but it's clear what the focus [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=325.76s)]
*  of these discussions is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=330.72s)]
*  It is the release of those hostages being held in Gaza, and it is, of course, the situation [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  regarding humanitarian aid, being able to flow into Gaza and having Americans who are [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=339.6s)]
*  trapped in Gaza be able to exit southward and into Egypt. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=344.44s)]
*  Over the last several days, there has been a lot of finger pointing, a lot of conflicting [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=348.88s)]
*  information concerning when or whether that Ra'afah crossing between Gaza and Egypt might [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=352.44s)]
*  indeed open. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  The Egyptian officials have blamed the Israelis at times, and there's been a lot of conflicting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=359.76000000000005s)]
*  information, U.S. embassy officials telling Americans inside of Gaza to head for that [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=367.0s)]
*  crossing expecting it to open. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  But as of yet, we have not seen any evidence that that crossing has indeed open. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=373.16s)]
*  So the question is whether at the end of this day, as the secretary of state concludes a [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=378.16s)]
*  series of meetings with Israeli officials, whether we will be in a place where humanitarian [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=382.04s)]
*  aid will start flowing into Gaza and whether those Americans and perhaps other civilians [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=386.88s)]
*  will be able to exit Gaza and into Egypt. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=391.24s)]
*  Amid all of this, we also have the Israeli prime minister inviting President Joe Biden [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=395.0s)]
*  to come visit Israel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=399.44s)]
*  The president so far not confirming whether or not he intends to visit Israel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=401.64s)]
*  But we do know that today he was scheduled to take a trip to Colorado. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  He canceled that trip at the last minute, staying at the White House instead for what [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=409.56s)]
*  describing as national security meetings, whether that is a prelude to a presidential [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=413.48s)]
*  visit here to Israel, we do not yet know. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  But of course, the situation on the ground remains extremely fluid. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=420.84s)]
*  We just had sirens nearby here in Jerusalem, rockets being fired in central Israel and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=424.12s)]
*  all of this, again, amid preparations by Israel for a potential ground invasion. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=429.88s)]
*  Sarah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=434.28s)]
*  Jerry Diamond, you have been so great on this story. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much for breaking that down for us. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  Another important meeting between the U.S. secretary of state and many of the leadership [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=443.56s)]
*  here in Israel. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=448.12s)]
*  I do want to mention why I'm here and why I'm where I am in Haifa. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=450.0s)]
*  We are about 85 miles from the Lebanon border where there have been rockets that have come [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=453.48s)]
*  over, but far, far, far fewer than what has come out of Gaza shot by Hamas. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=457.12s)]
*  There are rockets coming over the border because of Hezbollah, a sworn enemy of Israel's. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=464.96s)]
*  But for the most part, it has been quiet here in the north. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=470.8s)]
*  But what has also happened is that the United States has been getting so many inquiries [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=475.28s)]
*  from Americans who can't simply get out of Israel during wartime, many of them with children [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=479.6s)]
*  who are concerned about their safety, both mentally and physically. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=485.32s)]
*  Finally, the United States was able to charter an enormous ship that left from this port [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=488.6s)]
*  a couple of hours ago, and on it were American families who had been stuck here for days [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=495.48s)]
*  as the war raged on, unable to leave because there aren't enough flights. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=501.4s)]
*  Those flights are very sparse and almost all of them are completely packed leaving Israel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=505.28s)]
*  So this was one way to try to get hundreds of Americans out of Israel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=510.6s)]
*  They just took this. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=515.44s)]
*  They are currently in the water on a 10 hour travel time to Cyprus, which is where they [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71K-V7Du_FE&t=517.28s)]
