# Palestinian prime minister and government resign
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8)
*  Israeli military has also presented a plan for evacuating [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=0.0s)]
*  civilians from the areas of fighting in Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=3.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=5.76s)]
*  says the IDF presented the war cabinet with an upcoming [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  operational plan. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=10.68s)]
*  But it doesn't specifically mention the southern Gaza city [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=12.08s)]
*  of Ra'afah, where Israel has been planning [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  a potential ground offensive. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=16.96s)]
*  This comes as talks are expected to resume in Qatar today [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=19.28s)]
*  to try to secure the release of more hostages in Gaza [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=22.12s)]
*  in exchange for a pause in the fighting. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=25.44s)]
*  Journalist Elliot Gotkin joins us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=27.2s)]
*  Let's start with those hostage talks, then, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=29.32s)]
*  because you're describing how there does appear still [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=30.8s)]
*  to be some momentum behind them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=33.6s)]
*  There does. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=35.4s)]
*  We had these talks in Paris on Friday and Saturday, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  and we had Jake Sullivan of the National Security Council [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=38.64s)]
*  coming out after saying there's an understanding on the contours [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  of a potential deal had been reached. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=44.92s)]
*  So now it seems that in Doha, they're [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  going to be trying to deal with the Thornier issues [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=48.44s)]
*  to try to deal with those details and come [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=50.8s)]
*  to some kind of compromise. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  Now, up until these talks, the sticking point, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=54.24s)]
*  at least so far as Israel was concerned, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=56.16s)]
*  was Hamas's demands that there be a complete cessation [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=58.08s)]
*  of hostilities and the release of thousands [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=60.72s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners, demands [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  that Prime Minister Netanyahu described as delusional. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=65.24s)]
*  So the hope now is that perhaps they are inching [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  towards some kind of compromise, which, as you say, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=70.84s)]
*  would lead to the freeing of some, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=72.96s)]
*  but probably not all of those Israeli hostages, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  more than just over round about 100 believed to still be alive [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=77.52s)]
*  and being held in captivity in the Gaza Strip [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=80.24s)]
*  after being kidnapped on October the 7th in exchange [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=82.16s)]
*  for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=84.68s)]
*  and, of course, the all-important humanitarian [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=86.2s)]
*  pause of around about six weeks, and of course, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=88.44s)]
*  at the same time as that, a surge in humanitarian aid [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  to go where it's desperately needed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=93.92s)]
*  In terms of the Palestinian Authority, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=96.72s)]
*  what's the latest situation there in terms of leadership? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=99.04s)]
*  So we heard just this morning that the Prime Minister, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Mohammad Jadayah, submitted his resignation, along with that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=105.2s)]
*  of his entire government, to Mahmoud Abbas, the president [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=107.76s)]
*  of the Palestinian Authority. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=111.08s)]
*  Now, he still needs to offer his resignation in person. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  That still needs to be accepted. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  But this is seen to be perhaps one step [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  towards the revitalization, the reconstitution [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=120.2s)]
*  of the Palestinian Authority to enable [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=123.92s)]
*  it to be palatable to the Americans, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=126.28s)]
*  perhaps less unpalatable to the Israelis, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  for taking control of the Gaza Strip [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  the day after this war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=133.4s)]
*  Now, he will probably be asked to stay on as a caretaker [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=134.84s)]
*  prime minister, and there's no indication that whoever replaces [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=137.76s)]
*  him will be any different. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=140.8s)]
*  And, of course, the real change for the Palestinian Authority, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=141.88s)]
*  at least it won't be seen as changing to any serious degree [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=144.76s)]
*  until such time as Mahmoud Abbas is no longer president. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=147.72s)]
*  He, of course, is in now what, the 19th year of a four year term. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=150.56s)]
*  He's widely reviled among Palestinians. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  He's widely seen as being corrupt as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  So I think for the Palestinian Authority [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=158.32s)]
*  to be seen to be really changing, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  that Mahmoud Abbas would probably be expected to go as well. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=162.48s)]
*  OK, Elliot, thank you so much. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=166.16s)]
*  The death toll from this conflict [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=167.72s)]
*  is also rising outside of Gaza. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=169.64s)]
*  The Palestinian Ministry of Health says more [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  than 400 Palestinians have now been killed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=174.52s)]
*  in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7th, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  either by Israeli forces or settlers. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  That would include three Palestinians killed [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=184.68s)]
*  in the Jenin refugee camp this past week, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=187.24s)]
*  which the IDF confirmed as part of what they described [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=190.28s)]
*  as a counter-terrorism raid. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=193.56s)]
*  Anik Robertson met with the father [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=196.24s)]
*  of slain Palestinian-American teen Taufik Abdel-Ajabah, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  who was shot in the West Bank last month. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=202.44s)]
*  His father says their family is still struggling for answers [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=205.16s)]
*  and trying to bring the person responsible [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  for his son's killing to justice. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=210.44s)]
*  So this dirt road you see here? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=214.08s)]
*  The one down here? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is where Taufik was shot at. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  An American father, Hafez Abdel-Jabbar, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=219.44s)]
*  showing us his family land, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=222.76s)]
*  where he says his son was murdered [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  by an Israeli settler in January. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=227.4s)]
*  He wasn't going to do anything wrong. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  He was simply a barbecue Friday prayer and come back home. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=232.6s)]
*  And he's not a terrorist. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=234.92s)]
*  He's an American Palestinian kid full of life, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=236.12s)]
*  wanted to do so much in his life. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=240.16s)]
*  His son, Taufik, was 17 years old, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=242.28s)]
*  studying towards his dream job, NASA engineer. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=245.76s)]
*  The family left Louisiana last spring, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=249.8s)]
*  returning temporarily to their roots [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=252.48s)]
*  in the occupied West Bank. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=254.84s)]
*  They visited their ancestral hilltop village home [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=256.92s)]
*  most years. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=260.24s)]
*  All around the village, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=262.28s)]
*  there are murals of Taufik remembered, immortalized, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=263.12s)]
*  and underneath it says, the smiling martyr. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=267.71999999999997s)]
*  Taufik's trauma increasingly common in the West Bank. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=271.8s)]
*  And this is getting worse since October 7th. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=275.88s)]
*  It's getting worse since October 7th, way worse. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  They're turning it more like into Gaza. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=279.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  They want to turn it to Gaza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=282.44s)]
*  You see the bullet? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=284.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=285.2s)]
*  A month after Taufik's death, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=286.24s)]
*  Hafiz is struggling to get justice. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  The single shot that killed his son, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=291.72s)]
*  an exploding bullet entering the back of his head, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=294.32s)]
*  clear in the CT scan of his brain. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=297.56s)]
*  Photos of the crime scene [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=300.68s)]
*  and an investigation by the Palestinian Authority [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=302.6s)]
*  document 10 shots. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=306.20000000000005s)]
*  Video shows what Hafiz says [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=309.04s)]
*  is a soldier taking the final shot. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  An eyewitness says a settler took the first shot. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=314.36s)]
*  Israeli investigators say an off-duty police officer [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=317.72s)]
*  and an off-duty soldier were also present [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=321.24s)]
*  at the time of Taufik's killing, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=324.16s)]
*  but have yet to charge any of them. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=326.16s)]
*  They say the investigation is ongoing. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=328.76s)]
*  That's the problem that I'm facing right now, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=331.52s)]
*  that we all face in here, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=333.64s)]
*  that when they do such a thing [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=335.24s)]
*  and they're not stopped and they're not questioned, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=337.04s)]
*  it's okay for them to do it again and again and again. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=339.64s)]
*  And that's what keeps happening here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  This is not the first kid that got shot [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=343.72s)]
*  and killed in that same area. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DadIzZa_M8&t=345.64s)]
