# Biden: Downplaying Hamas' October 7 attack must stop
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg)
*  But right now, President Biden is delivering remarks [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=0.0s)]
*  at the U.S. Capitol, so we're going to listen in. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=2.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, sir. Please. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=4.16s)]
*  Thank you, Stu, for that introduction, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=11.84s)]
*  for your leadership in the United States [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Holocaust Memorial Museum, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=17.52s)]
*  your true scholar and statesman, and a dear friend, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=20.44s)]
*  Speaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=25.44s)]
*  members of Congress, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=28.52s)]
*  and especially the survivors of the Holocaust. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  My mother, she looked at you and said, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  God love you all. God love you all. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=34.52s)]
*  Abe Foxman and all other survivors [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  who embody absolute courage and dignity and grace [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=40.96s)]
*  are here as well. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=44.0s)]
*  During these sacred days of remembrance, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=45.72s)]
*  we grieve, we give voice to the six million Jews [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=49.16s)]
*  who were systematically targeted, murdered by the Nazis, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=52.72s)]
*  and their collaborators during World War II. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=57.8s)]
*  We honor the memory of victims, the pain of survivors, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  the bravery of heroes who stood up to Hitler's unspeakable evil, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=66.56s)]
*  and we recommit to heading and heeding the lessons [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=71.32s)]
*  that one of the darkest chapters in human history [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=77.0s)]
*  to revitalize and realize the responsibility of Never Again. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=79.84s)]
*  Never Again simply translated for me means never forget, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=84.75999999999999s)]
*  never forget. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=91.88s)]
*  must keep teaching the truth, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=96.0s)]
*  must keep teaching our children and our grandchildren. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=98.28s)]
*  The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=101.8s)]
*  That's why growing up, my dad taught me and my siblings [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  about the horrors of the Shoah, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=111.24s)]
*  at our family dinner table. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=113.28s)]
*  That's why I visited Yad Vashem with my family, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=115.68s)]
*  as a senator, as vice president and as president. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=118.92s)]
*  And that's why I took my grandchildren to Dachau [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=122.76s)]
*  so they could see and bear witness [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  to the perils of indifference, the complicity of silence, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=127.64s)]
*  and the face of evil that they knew was happening. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=131.64s)]
*  Germany, 1933. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=134.84s)]
*  Hitler and his Nazi party rise to power. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=138.28s)]
*  They rise to power by rekindling one of the world's oldest forms [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=140.6s)]
*  of prejudice and hate, anti-Semitism. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=145.0s)]
*  Israel then began with mass murder. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=149.88s)]
*  It started slowly across economic, political, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=152.72s)]
*  social, and cultural life. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=157.0s)]
*  Propaganda demonizing Jews, boycotts of Jewish businesses, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=160.04s)]
*  synagogues defaced with swastikas, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=165.48s)]
*  harassment of Jews in the street and the schools, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=168.56s)]
*  anti-Semitic demonstrations, pogroms, organized riots. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  With the indifference of the world, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  Hitler knew he could expand his reign of terror [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  by eliminating Jews from Germany [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=185.2s)]
*  to annihilate Jews across Europe through genocide [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=187.68s)]
*  that Nazis call the final solution. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=191.12s)]
*  Concentration camps, gas chambers, mass shootings. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=193.52s)]
*  By the time the war ended, 6 million Jews, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  one out of every three Jews in the entire world, were murdered. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=206.32s)]
*  This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=211.12s)]
*  and didn't end with the Holocaust either, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=214.8s)]
*  or after, even after our victory in World War II. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=217.28s)]
*  This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=220.56s)]
*  of too many people in the world [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=224.48s)]
*  and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=226.96s)]
*  That hatred was brought to life on October 7th, in 2023. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=233.44s)]
*  On a sacred Jewish holiday, the terrorist group Hamas [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=238.24s)]
*  unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=243.28s)]
*  Driven by ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the earth, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=247.76s)]
*  over 1,200 innocent people, babies, parents, grandparents, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=252.72s)]
*  slaughtered in their kibbutz, massacred at a music festival, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=262.0s)]
*  brutally raped, mutilated, and sexually assaulted. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  Thousands more carrying wounds, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=271.52s)]
*  bullets and shrapnel from the memory of that terrible day they endured. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=275.2s)]
*  Hundreds taken hostage, including survivors of the Shoah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=288.4s)]
*  And people are already forgetting, are already forgetting [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=298.8s)]
*  that Hamas unleashed this terror. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=303.76s)]
*  There was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=307.2s)]
*  There was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=311.2s)]
*  I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=316.0s)]
*  And as Jews around the world still cope with the atrocities and trauma of that day [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=320.32s)]
*  and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of anti-Semitism in America and around the world. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=325.36s)]
*  Vicious propaganda on social media, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  and the massacres of the Jewish people, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=338.48s)]
*  and the massacres of the Jewish people, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=341.2s)]
*  and the massacres of the Jewish people, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=343.68s)]
*  on social media. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=347.44s)]
*  Jews forced to keep their hide, to keep us under baseball hats, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=350.48s)]
*  tuck their Jewish stars into their shirts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=356.8s)]
*  On college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=360.32s)]
*  Anti-Semitism, anti-Semitic posters, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=368.64000000000004s)]
*  slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=372.96s)]
*  Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=382.32s)]
*  On October 7th, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=390.4s)]
*  It's absolutely despicable, and it must stop. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=400.23999999999995s)]
*  Silence. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=405.11999999999995s)]
*  Silence in denial can hide much, but it can erase nothing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=413.11999999999995s)]
*  Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  they cannot be buried, no matter how hard people try. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  In my view, a major lesson to the Holocaust is, as mentioned earlier, it was not inevitable. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=429.76s)]
*  We know hate never goes away, it only hides. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  And given a little oxygen, it comes out from under the rocks. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=441.91999999999996s)]
*  We also know what stops hate. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=446.0s)]
*  One thing, all of us. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  The late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks described anti-Semitism as a virus [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=452.23999999999995s)]
*  that has survived and mutated over time. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  Together, we cannot continue to let that happen. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=460.23999999999995s)]
*  We have to remember our basic principles as a nation. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  We have an obligation. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=469.76s)]
*  We have an obligation to learn the lessons of history, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=471.52s)]
*  so we don't surrender our future to the horrors of the past. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=478.79999999999995s)]
*  Anyone. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=482.96s)]
*  From the very founding, our very founding, Jewish Americans, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  who represent only about 2% of the U.S. population, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=488.08s)]
*  have helped lead the cause of freedom for everyone in our nation. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=491.44s)]
*  From that experience, we know scapegoating and demonizing any minority [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=496.32s)]
*  is a threat to every minority and the very foundation of our democracy. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=502.4s)]
*  So in moments like this, we have to put these principles that we're talking about into action. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=507.76s)]
*  I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=513.68s)]
*  In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=518.8s)]
*  to debate and disagree, to protest peacefully, and make our voices heard. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=525.92s)]
*  I understand that's America, but there is no place on any campus in America, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=533.04s)]
*  any place in America, for anti-Semitism or hate speech. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=539.12s)]
*  Whether against Jews or anyone else, violence attacks, destroying property, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=542.48s)]
*  is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=549.28s)]
*  And we are not a lawless country. We're a civil society. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=553.36s)]
*  We uphold the rule of law. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  We are not a country that is against the law. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=560.4s)]
*  We are not a country that is against the law. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=564.08s)]
*  And we are not a lawless country. We're a civil society. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=566.48s)]
*  We uphold the rule of law. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=570.88s)]
*  And no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=573.0400000000001s)]
*  To the Jewish community, I want you to know, I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  Let me reassure you, as your president, you're not alone. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  You belong. You always have and you always will. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=596.88s)]
*  My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWhlNn_CPVg&t=602.24s)]
