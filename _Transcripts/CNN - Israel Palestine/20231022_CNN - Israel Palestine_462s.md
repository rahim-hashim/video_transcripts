# Humanitarian worker describes why it's 'impossible' to evacuate northern Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo)
*  Nearly 40 tons of medical aid and disaster relief supplies for Gaza left [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=0.0s)]
*  India for Egypt this morning. This is according to India's Ministry of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=4.4s)]
*  External Affairs. Despite the rafa crossing opening for a short time [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=8.48s)]
*  yesterday to allow trucks with a 20 trucks to be exact to pass through, it [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=12.4s)]
*  remains unclear if or when the border will reopen today. CNN's Priscilla [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=17.16s)]
*  Alvarez joining us now with how President Biden is responding to the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=23.56s)]
*  humanitarian efforts. Priscilla. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=28.14s)]
*  Well, in a statement just yesterday, the president attributed this to days of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=32.9s)]
*  diplomatic engagement at the highest level. Of course, these a tracks a [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=37.58s)]
*  trucks passing through happened on the heels of President Biden's trip to [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=41.9s)]
*  Israel, as well as Secretary of State Antony Blinken's high stakes shuttle [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=45.260000000000005s)]
*  diplomacy over the last several days. Now, in a statement, the president went [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=49.5s)]
*  on to note that this is a critical and urgent need, saying, quote, I made it [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=53.7s)]
*  clear from the outset of this crisis in both my public statements and private [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=57.36s)]
*  conversations that humanitarian assistance was a critical and urgent [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=61.12s)]
*  need that had to get moving. And I expressed my deep personal appreciation [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=65.32s)]
*  for the leadership of President Al Sisi of Egypt, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=69.4s)]
*  of Israel and the United Nations to allow the resumption of this assistance. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  And of course, we should also mention that President Biden did speak with [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=78.34s)]
*  Egypt's president this week, where the two agreed for this crossing to be [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=81.68s)]
*  open. But of course, this remains a challenge. We have heard from eight [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=86.64s)]
*  organizations who have welcomed the A trucks that have been able to pass into [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=90.16s)]
*  Gaza so far, but they note that this can only be the beginning. They still need [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=94.24s)]
*  so much more. So the White House still working on trying to facilitate that, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=99.32s)]
*  working with their counterparts in the region, while also keeping a focus on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=103.52s)]
*  getting Palestinian Americans out of Gaza, which they have still not been [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=108.6s)]
*  able to do. Amara Victor, Brazil, Alvarez for us. Thanks so much. Joining us now is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=113.2s)]
*  Nebal Farsak, spokesperson for the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Thank you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  for being with us. Let me start with the 17 trucks in Egypt waiting at the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=123.36s)]
*  Rafa crossing, hoping to get into Gaza. Our reporters have spoken with those [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=129.0s)]
*  truck drivers say they're optimistic. What can you tell us about what's on [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  the trucks and the probability that they'll get across that that border [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=137.96s)]
*  today? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=141.66s)]
*  Good evening. Thanks for having me. So yes, as you highlighted, there's dozens [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=144.46s)]
*  of trucks who are still waiting at Rafa crossing bird border waiting to get an [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=148.46s)]
*  into Gaza. What we have received up to now is a 20 trucks, hoping this will be [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=153.94s)]
*  a glimpse of hope to the entry of the rest of the trucks because 20 trucks is [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=159.26s)]
*  only like a drop in the ocean of needs. We still need a lot in terms of food, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=165.14s)]
*  even water. Two million Palestinian civilians now are with no food or even [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=171.38s)]
*  water besides electricity, as well as not only one hospital. All hospitals in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=176.5s)]
*  Gaza are witnessing a collapse status, having shortages and medicine, medical [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=182.78s)]
*  supplies, as well as running out of fuel. And by the way, if you will, was not [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=188.18s)]
*  also delivered by the first shipment of the humanitarian aid, which included [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=193.42s)]
*  food, water, medical supply and medicine, but not fuel. Are you getting any [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=198.86s)]
*  indication as to when, if at all, there will be a sustained delivery of aid into [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  Gaza? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  So basically, all international organizations along with countries have [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  been working due to all the last week long to get the aid and hopefully now [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=220.88s)]
*  after this aid was already in to continue working and advocating for the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  entry of a humanitarian aid. This this should not be a one time. We need a [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=234.84s)]
*  humanitarian corridor to allow the entry of medical supplies and the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=241.16s)]
*  humanitarian aid all the time in a safe way to guarantee to fulfill the needs of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=245.68s)]
*  the humanitarian situation now in Gaza, because the humanitarian situation is [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=252.56s)]
*  literally catastrophic, whether in terms of extreme shortages of food and water [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=258.0s)]
*  or even hospitals who are now running out of fuel and without the fuel, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=264.08s)]
*  simply all hospitals can't operate and cutting electricity means killing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=269.28s)]
*  thousands of Palestinian civilians who were injured and now inside the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=276.08s)]
*  hospitals. So all of the aid does not include fuel. That's why we still count [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=281.0s)]
*  on the international community to keep advocating for the entry of a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  humanitarian aid, not only from Rafah crossing border, but from all borders [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=291.52s)]
*  controlled from the Israelis because Israel as an occupying power has a [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=297.20000000000005s)]
*  responsibility to ensure to provide the essential needs for civilians in Gaza as [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=301.8s)]
*  well as hospitals who are implementing their health care worker services and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=307.68s)]
*  this should be not continued. Healthcare facilities and hospitals along with [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=314.44s)]
*  civilians should not pay the price and should be protected and respected [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  according to the IHL that the Israelis concern is that the fuel if it gets in [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=326.12s)]
*  will make it to Hamas. Let me ask you about the latest leaflets dropped by IDF [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=330.64s)]
*  that and the Israelis contest this CNN translation, but it is that if [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  Palestinians do not move south, they may be seen partners of the terrorist. What [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  can you tell us about your organization's ability to provide aid to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=346.12s)]
*  northern Gaza if the order from the IDF is to move south? We know that there are [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=352.64s)]
*  still many thousands of Palestinians who are in northern Gaza. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=358.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, let me clarify something in the targeted area where Israel threatened to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=365.04s)]
*  be evacuated around a million and 200,000 Palestinians who are live in [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=370.36s)]
*  the north. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were still stuck in Gaza in [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=377.56s)]
*  their homes or any schools or even hospitals. They couldn't find their way [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=384.16s)]
*  to evacuate themselves simply because Israel asking people to evacuate [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  themselves under continuous bombardment. Besides, there is no transportation, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=393.18s)]
*  complete destruction of the roads and infrastructure, so absolutely they have [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=398.88s)]
*  no way to go to. They don't have an option to choose either. It's the same [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=403.28s)]
*  case for hospitals because Israel not only asking civilians to evacuate [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=408.96s)]
*  themselves under continuous bombardment, evacuation orders from Israeli [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=413.64s)]
*  occupation forces for around 24 hospital in Gaza and the north to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=418.76s)]
*  evacuate, which are absolutely impossible to implement. W. H. O. Has [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=424.64s)]
*  announced that evacuation orders for hospitals are impossible to implement [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=430.6s)]
*  and they constitute a death penalty for patients. Our hospital is one of the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=436.32s)]
*  hospital that has received the evacuation order. We have 500 patients, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=441.56s)]
*  some of them in the intensive care unit, and we will not be able and accept to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=446.6s)]
*  risk the lives of our patients. Most of them are Children. Sure, I mean, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=452.08s)]
*  impossible situation for those hospitals as well. Nibble, a far sack. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGXgCyZvBzo&t=460.48s)]
