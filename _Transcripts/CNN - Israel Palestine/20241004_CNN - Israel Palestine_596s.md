# How involved should the US be in the growing crisis in the Middle East? Analysts discuss
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4)
*  on a knife's edge as fighting in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=0.0s)]
*  heads towards an all-out war. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=2.6s)]
*  Israel now fighting on two fronts, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  in Gaza and Lebanon, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=7.26s)]
*  could soon open up a third front with Iran, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=9.06s)]
*  and the U.S. seemingly powerless to contain the crisis. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=12.02s)]
*  The response will be painful. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=17.1s)]
*  Israel weighing a retaliatory strike against Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=19.64s)]
*  Okay, guys, we gotta get off the roof. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  After that regime launched almost 200 missiles [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=25.28s)]
*  across Israel at military and intelligence installations. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=28.28s)]
*  The United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=32.84s)]
*  But President Biden urging Israel [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=36.56s)]
*  not to go too far in its response. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=38.72s)]
*  Would you support an attack on Iran's nucleus? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=41.24s)]
*  I'm fine with that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=43.68s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  They have a right to respond, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=46.84s)]
*  but they should respond in proportion. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  But look at the past year [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=50.32s)]
*  when U.S. warnings have mostly been ignored. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=51.8s)]
*  Biden drew this red line in May. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  If they go into Ra'aifa, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  I'm not supplying the weapons [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=59.4s)]
*  that have been used historically to deal with Ra'aifa. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  Less than a week later, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=63.36s)]
*  Israeli forces raiding that city in Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=64.56s)]
*  Then Biden's many proposals for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=68.52s)]
*  It's a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  and the release of all hostages. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=76.56s)]
*  We have the basis for a ceasefire. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=78.84s)]
*  Put out a statement for a 21-day ceasefire. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=81.0s)]
*  But two days after that last U.S. initiative, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=85.56s)]
*  Israel bombed Beirut, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=88.72s)]
*  killing Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=90.44s)]
*  Here with me today, podcaster, journalist, and author, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=94.72s)]
*  Kara Swisher. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=98.08s)]
*  Raihan Salaam, President of the Manhattan Institute [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=99.56s)]
*  and National Review contributing editor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=102.36s)]
*  New York Times journalist and the interview podcast host, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=105.08s)]
*  Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=108.08s)]
*  And conservative pollster [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=110.16s)]
*  and New York Times opinion writer, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=111.4s)]
*  Kristen Soltis Anderson. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=112.88s)]
*  Welcome back everyone. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=114.28s)]
*  Raihan, can a wider regional war still be avoided? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=116.52s)]
*  The wider regional war has been going on [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=121.72s)]
*  for about a year now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=124.24s)]
*  And Israel is now forcefully engaging [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=125.6s)]
*  in that wider regional war. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=128.24s)]
*  Iran has been deeply involved, deeply implicated, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=129.72s)]
*  both in the October 7th attack itself, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=133.04s)]
*  that in Hezbollah's pounding of communities [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=135.12s)]
*  in the north of Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  And now Israel is doing what it needs to do [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=138.48s)]
*  in order to ensure its security. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=141.72s)]
*  So this wider regional war has been going on. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  But it was through the proxies of Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=145.76s)]
*  Now it's directly between Tehran and Jerusalem. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=150.04s)]
*  That is different. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=154.2s)]
*  Well, Iran did launch a missile attack back in April, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=155.12s)]
*  as we'll recall. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=157.92s)]
*  And now, you know, look, they're on the back foot. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=158.96s)]
*  And now Israel is pressing its advantage [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=162.04s)]
*  exactly as it should. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=164.2s)]
*  Israel is doing things today [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=166.04s)]
*  that they were looking to do in October, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=168.12s)]
*  way back a year ago. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=171.08s)]
*  And they were restrained [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  because the Biden administration said then, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  guys, look, slow it down. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  95% plus of Israelis are strongly in favor [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=178.12s)]
*  of taking action against Hezbollah [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=181.88000000000002s)]
*  because of the incredibly deadly threat [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=183.56s)]
*  it represents to Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=185.84s)]
*  And now they've demonstrated [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  that they penetrated Hezbollah thoroughly [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=189.12s)]
*  and they have greatly degraded its ability [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=191.96s)]
*  to harm Israelis and others in the region. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=194.52s)]
*  Well, as we wait now to see [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=196.16s)]
*  how Israel is going to respond to that barrage [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  of missiles this past week, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=201.56s)]
*  Iran's new president has warned [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=203.76s)]
*  they will fight back. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=206.76s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=207.96s)]
*  If the Zionist regime does not stop its crimes, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  it will face harsher reactions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=214.24s)]
*  If they want to respond, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=216.72s)]
*  they will face a more severe response. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=218.68s)]
*  Lulu, how big could a direct conflict [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  between Iran and Israel, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=225.88s)]
*  not through proxies, but a direct conflict, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=227.16s)]
*  how bad could that get? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=229.88s)]
*  It could get very bad. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  I think we're in a very dangerous period. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=232.4s)]
*  What kept the Middle East sort of nominally controlled [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=234.92s)]
*  is that there was this sense [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=240.76s)]
*  that there were red lines [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  that neither side was going to cross. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=243.76s)]
*  So on the one hand, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=245.4s)]
*  Israel wasn't going to actually launch a direct attack [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=246.8s)]
*  in Iran, which they did [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=249.84s)]
*  with the killing of the leader of Hamas. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=251.96s)]
*  And on the other hand, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=254.8s)]
*  Iran wasn't going to launch missiles directly [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=256.6s)]
*  on a place like Tel Aviv. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=258.6s)]
*  So what we have here is that all the red lines [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  have been blown through and a very combustible situation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  I think at this point, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  President Biden has been urging calm, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  but those days of calm are well over. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=270.36s)]
*  And we're now seeing a very, very volatile period. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=272.16s)]
*  And it's not really clear what's going to happen [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=274.76s)]
*  because the real problem here is that yes, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=276.92s)]
*  Israel has launched these attacks, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=279.8s)]
*  but there is no plan for what happens after. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=281.6s)]
*  As we showed in the set up piece, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=284.6s)]
*  President Biden says the Israeli response, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=286.68s)]
*  which we expect in the next few days, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=289.52s)]
*  should be proportionate. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=291.12s)]
*  And he ruled out an attack on Iran's nuclear program. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=293.2s)]
*  Former President Trump didn't think much of that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, to make the statement, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=301.04s)]
*  please leave their nuclear alone, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=302.04s)]
*  I would tell you that that's not the right answer. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=304.92s)]
*  That was the craziest answer, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=308.08s)]
*  because you know what? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=309.68s)]
*  Soon they're going to have nuclear weapons [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=310.52s)]
*  and then you're going to have problems. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=312.0s)]
*  Kristen, how much should the US get involved and in what way? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=314.32s)]
*  I think the United States needs to reaffirm [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=319.56s)]
*  that Israel is our number one ally in that region, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=321.84s)]
*  that we have their back. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=325.36s)]
*  And I think it's the sense [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=326.88s)]
*  that we have been undercutting them, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=328.52s)]
*  either privately or publicly, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=330.64s)]
*  that has led to this erosion of trust. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=331.96s)]
*  The relationship between Bibi Netanyahu [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=335.0s)]
*  and the Biden administration is not great right now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=337.24s)]
*  There's a lot of finger pointing about why that is, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=340.48s)]
*  but my sense is that Joe Biden does not have a ton of influence [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=342.32s)]
*  over what Bibi Netanyahu does. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=346.64s)]
*  And so all along you've thought Bibi is bad [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=348.48s)]
*  and he's handling this incorrectly. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=350.84s)]
*  I think Biden's actions have made it less easy for the US, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=352.8s)]
*  at least for the next few months, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=355.92s)]
*  until we get a new president to help restrain. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=356.92s)]
*  The Biden administration has been giving [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=360.28s)]
*  exactly where it counts, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=363.2s)]
*  which is enormous amounts of aid, military and otherwise. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=364.44s)]
*  The fact that they are urging restraint [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=368.84s)]
*  is the traditional role of the United States, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=370.84000000000003s)]
*  not just with Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=373.16s)]
*  but throughout the history of the state of Israel. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  I think there have been things like, for instance, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  saying, please, you shouldn't go into Ra'afah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=378.84000000000003s)]
*  And then they say, you know what, we're going to go in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=381.92s)]
*  and we are going to find hostages [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=383.32s)]
*  that Hamas has been holding that have not been turned over. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=385.04s)]
*  I do think that there have been... [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=388.0s)]
*  How many hostages have been killed? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  And not only that, how many Palestinians have been killed? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  And not only that, what is the end game here? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=392.56s)]
*  You now have the state of Israel fighting in Gaza, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=395.0s)]
*  you now have the state of Israel fighting in the north [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=397.88s)]
*  against Hezbollah in the south of Lebanon. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  And now you have maybe potentially [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=403.28s)]
*  a direct conflict with Iran. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  It just feels like you're always telling Israel [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=405.88s)]
*  that they have to be the ones that are restrained [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=407.35999999999996s)]
*  when it is them who is getting raucous. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=409.28s)]
*  You have to shot into their screens. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=411.12s)]
*  I want to bring Kara in because it seems to me [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=412.08s)]
*  that what you're describing, Lulu, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=414.08s)]
*  has actually put the US in kind of the worst of both worlds. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=417.32s)]
*  On the one hand, we're saying, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=420.44s)]
*  hey, go slow, don't do this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=422.96s)]
*  On the other hand, we're continuing to give them [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  billions of dollars and tons of armaments. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=428.2s)]
*  I mean, you tick off everybody. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it's sort of Biden who. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=432.64s)]
*  He doesn't have influence at all. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=434.28s)]
*  And no one's going to be listening to him [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=435.64s)]
*  because they're waiting for whoever the next president is. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=437.24s)]
*  So it doesn't hardly matter [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=439.44s)]
*  because nothing is going to happen in that time period. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=440.79999999999995s)]
*  And therefore they're not going to take any kind of advice [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=442.59999999999997s)]
*  from the US. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  Probably what they should be doing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=446.32s)]
*  is working behind the scenes with other Arab countries [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=447.15999999999997s)]
*  to help bring something together. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=449.96s)]
*  But there's no influence here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=451.64s)]
*  Ryan, this gets to the bigger question. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=453.12s)]
*  Can, and it goes beyond the Middle East, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=455.44s)]
*  can our allies and can our adversaries [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=458.8s)]
*  ignore what the American president says [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=462.08s)]
*  without any consequence? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=465.48s)]
*  Well, there's a perception that President Biden [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=466.88s)]
*  at the moment is incredibly inconstant. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=469.56s)]
*  There was a little moment at a press conference [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=472.12s)]
*  not long ago where he was asked a question [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=473.72s)]
*  about whether or not Israel [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=476.12s)]
*  would be striking Iranian oil fields. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=477.2s)]
*  And he gave his usual kind of slap dash answer of, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=479.52s)]
*  well, we're talking about that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=483.04s)]
*  Anyway, let's move on. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=484.56s)]
*  And then immediately oil prices surged [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  by close to 6% on that news. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=488.08s)]
*  And it caused an enormous amount of panic in the region. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=490.68s)]
*  That's the kind of thing you don't casually [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  inartlessly share as an aside during a press conference. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=495.79999999999995s)]
*  There was a time when the United States [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  and the Biden administration did have more leverage [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=501.24s)]
*  with respect to the conflict in the Middle East. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  That leverage has steadily diminished, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=505.47999999999996s)]
*  not just because he's a lame duck president, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  but also because of that same inconstancy [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=509.35999999999996s)]
*  that Kristen was describing before. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=511.96s)]
*  The sense that you're going to be a backseat driver, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=513.9599999999999s)]
*  you're going to undermine your partner, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  but then you're actually not going to do anything [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=518.04s)]
*  especially effective. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=519.56s)]
*  Right now, Israel is taking actions [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=521.16s)]
*  that benefit not just the Israeli people, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=523.0799999999999s)]
*  but it's actually doing things to undermine enemies [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=525.7199999999999s)]
*  of the United States, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=527.8399999999999s)]
*  whereas the Biden administration [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  has been utterly confused and confusing. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=530.36s)]
*  A huge humanitarian cost. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=532.36s)]
*  I mean, I understand that we can talk, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=534.04s)]
*  we can talk geopolitically, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=537.28s)]
*  but there is a cost in lives [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=539.16s)]
*  and there is a cost in safety, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=542.12s)]
*  and we are seeing that in Lebanon, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=544.8s)]
*  we are seeing that in Gaza, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=546.52s)]
*  and we are seeing that in Israel. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=547.4s)]
*  And we are seeing that in Israel. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=549.04s)]
*  But would you agree with what Raihan said [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=549.88s)]
*  that whether because of inconstancy or incompetence [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=552.76s)]
*  or whatever it is, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=557.92s)]
*  that people just don't pay that much attention [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=559.48s)]
*  to this president. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=561.68s)]
*  I don't think it's just the lame duck thing [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=562.52s)]
*  that they don't pay that much attention [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=564.68s)]
*  to Joe Biden anymore on the world stage. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=566.28s)]
*  On the world stage or Israel in particular? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=568.6800000000001s)]
*  On the world stage. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=570.84s)]
*  I would say on the world stage, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=571.88s)]
*  I don't think that that's true. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=573.2s)]
*  Certainly that isn't true [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=574.24s)]
*  if you think of the Ukraine conflict. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=575.48s)]
*  I do think it's true when it has to do with Israel, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=577.12s)]
*  but I don't think it's unique to this particular conflict. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=579.24s)]
*  We've seen that over and over again, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=581.48s)]
*  because the state of Israel, as any country does, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=583.24s)]
*  does what's in its best interest. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=585.52s)]
*  And in this case, this particular president thinks that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  what this particular leader thinks [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=590.12s)]
*  what's in his best interest is to go forth [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=591.6s)]
*  and try and attack Hezbollah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctJcEOCWkk4&t=594.32s)]
