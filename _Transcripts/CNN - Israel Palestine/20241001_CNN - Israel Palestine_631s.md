# IDF releases footage showing underground tunnels in Lebanon
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E)
*  The Israeli military defending its ground incursion into southern Lebanon, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=0.0s)]
*  saying it aims to stop attempts by Hezbollah to infiltrate Israel, also [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=3.68s)]
*  saying Israeli forces have been carrying out raids into southern Lebanon for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  months now. An IDF spokesman releasing new video footage this morning, saying [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=13.32s)]
*  it shows Hezbollah's underground tunnels in Lebanon. Israel says it has [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=17.8s)]
*  destroyed many of them. These details coming just hours after Israel [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=22.2s)]
*  announced it launched a ground operation inside Lebanon. CNN military [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=26.68s)]
*  analyst, retired Army Major General James Spider marks is joining us this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=31.08s)]
*  morning. Thank you so much for being here. We're hearing about this ground [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=34.76s)]
*  incursion. Israel saying it is a limited ground incursion. What does [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=38.54s)]
*  that allow Israel to do as it's going in and out, trying not to keep troops on [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=42.92s)]
*  the ground for very long? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=50.0s)]
*  To define an invasion as limited is a priori before the bulk of this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  operation gets underway is it's a definition that's very imprecise. Look, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=58.28s)]
*  the Hezbollah has a vote in how this thing unravels, right? So to describe [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  it as limited is great, which means Israel hopes to be very precise in [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  its targeting. They want to go after the infrastructure of Hezbollah. They [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=73.24s)]
*  want to go after storage locations. Look, they're looking for evidence that [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=76.64s)]
*  they can go to the International Criminal Court and say Hezbollah routinely [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  positions its weapon systems in houses. They use that for storage. Not that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  anybody's gonna care, but at least that gives them at least it gives the world [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=90.72s)]
*  an understanding of what Hezbollah is all about if it's not already [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=95.36s)]
*  sufficiently clear. But I think it's important that what Israel's trying to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=98.44s)]
*  do is they're trying to push Hezbollah north of the Latani, which we understand. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=103.0s)]
*  However, if they can do that and the UN Security Council resolution indicates [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  that it should be done, hasn't been enforced, still a large percentage of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=113.96s)]
*  Israel is still under the range of those ballistic missiles. So it's a good [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=118.6s)]
*  start. But Israel would really like to push, I think, would like to push beyond [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=123.28s)]
*  the Latani. They're flushed with victory from Gaza. They've got the capacity [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=127.8s)]
*  to do it. The challenge is, is they don't wanna get stuck. And that's why [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=132.84s)]
*  they're describing this thing up front as a limited incursion. They wanna [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  get some very precise locations, push as many as the Hezbollah fighters [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=140.12s)]
*  beyond the Latani and then see what happens from there. But I don't anticipate [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=144.88s)]
*  that they wanna occupy ground. They don't wanna own that ground. They wanna [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=148.88s)]
*  push Hezbollah back, then they wanna get back to Israel. And they have said [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=153.36s)]
*  that. They don't wanna sort of be there occupying for months and months and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=157.08s)]
*  months. I do wanna sort of go into this regional map and just look at some of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=161.2s)]
*  the places that Israel has struck because it's not just Lebanon. You have [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=166.52s)]
*  Lebanon, you have Syria, you have Yemen. When you look at this this map, there [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=171.0s)]
*  is that big fear of a regional war. And of course, you have had the Houthis [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=179.2s)]
*  firing on Israel as well. What do you make of all this? As the Biden [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=184.2s)]
*  administration has said, we have to get a ceasefire. Now they're talking about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=189.92s)]
*  a ceasefire with Hezbollah with, you know, trying to stop this incursion [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=193.92s)]
*  into Lebanon. What is your takeaway on all this as to where this goes from [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=197.95999999999998s)]
*  here? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=201.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Sarah, make a little green check mark up on Tehran. Israel [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=204.76s)]
*  has been very successful going after and they killed the political leader. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=209.16s)]
*  There you go. The political leader of Gaza. So what we're seeing is Israel's [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  got an immense capacity to reach and operate on these what we call multiple [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=218.76s)]
*  lines of effort. I mean, you've just described it so very well on the map. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=223.88s)]
*  The challenge of a much larger Mideast conflict rests with the leadership in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=228.28s)]
*  Tehran. What are they gonna do next? We haven't seen that directly, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=233.92s)]
*  We've seen it through the proxies. Proxies now have been damaged. All [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=238.04s)]
*  three of those big ones have been damaged. However, if you look at the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  Shia arc from Tehran all the way down into Damascus, you've got terrorist [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=244.72s)]
*  organizations that are linked to Tehran of different sorts that have the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=249.88s)]
*  ability to strike at targets in the region. The United States is one of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=254.16s)]
*  those. We still have a presence in the region. United States is wise to say, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=257.88s)]
*  Look, we've got it. We've got to chill this thing down a little bit. It's way [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=261.8s)]
*  too hot. However, Israel has a capacity to meet interjected that they've never [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=265.12s)]
*  been able to meet before. And the world has acquiesced to this form of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=270.82s)]
*  terrorism. Something has to be done. How? Well, we will see how this goes in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=275.46s)]
*  the coming days. Major General James Spider marks. Thank you so much for [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=280.9s)]
*  your great analysis this morning. I really appreciate you coming on. What [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=284.17999999999995s)]
*  else have we heard from the idea today about this operation? Well, they're [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=287.34s)]
*  putting some meat on the bone here as to what exactly they're trying to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=291.65999999999997s)]
*  accomplish with what they're describing as limited ground operations raids, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=294.17999999999995s)]
*  which of course implies not a permanent presence there going after essentially [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=297.86s)]
*  firing positions where Hamas where husband rather has been firing into [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=301.74s)]
*  northern Israel. Admiral Hogari. He described exactly what they did in one [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=305.54s)]
*  of these villages along the border just a short time ago. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  During this operations, IDF special forces entered into his bala compounds [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=314.98s)]
*  in dozens of locations along the border with Israel, collected intelligence, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=320.76s)]
*  dismantled his balance weapons and terrorist infrastructures. Our soldiers [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=326.46000000000004s)]
*  entered his balance underground infrastructures, exposed his balance [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=331.66s)]
*  hidden weapon caches and seized and destroyed the weapons, including [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  advanced Iranian made weapons. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=341.42s)]
*  To be clear, Hogari was describing raids that took place not just in the last [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  24 hours, but over previous weeks as well. I think with the intention of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=351.26s)]
*  saying, Listen, we've been doing this before. What we're doing now is not a [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=355.54s)]
*  massive change from that. But the fact is, if Israel's goal, and this is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=359.14s)]
*  Bennett stated goal is to push Hezbollah back beyond firing range or as [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=364.5s)]
*  far beyond firing range as they could manage from the northern border, we [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=368.5s)]
*  have to talk about the Latani River. If their intention is to enforce UN [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=371.9s)]
*  Security Council Resolution 1701, which required has bullet and move back [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=375.54s)]
*  beyond the Latani River. We're talking 20 miles here, and we're talking many [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=379.02s)]
*  dozens of villages that you would have to clear like we saw them do this one [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=383.22s)]
*  village right across the border in the last 24 hours. And that doesn't just [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=387.46s)]
*  imply that would require a large number of forces over time. So that speaks to [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=392.02s)]
*  a much larger operation for a longer, longer duration as well. Many will say [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=397.98s)]
*  it is inconceivable that the US had no intelligence about this operation. And [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=403.7s)]
*  indeed, the US have said that the Israelis have shared options, operational [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=409.62s)]
*  options with them. Let's just have a listen to what President Biden had to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=414.82s)]
*  say. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=419.82s)]
*  Then you might know, and I'm comfortable with them stopping. We [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=421.3s)]
*  should have a ceasefire now. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=424.86s)]
*  Later, State Department spokesman the State Department spokesman added this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  At the same time, there are a couple other things that are true as well, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=435.5s)]
*  which is that number one military pressure can at times enable diplomacy. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=438.3s)]
*  Of course, military pressure can also lead to miscalculation. It can lead to [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=442.98s)]
*  unintended consequences. And we're in conversations with Israel about all of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=447.26s)]
*  these factors now. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=450.7s)]
*  What's the US perspective here? What is the US want at this point? Well, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=454.90000000000003s)]
*  listen, they're in conversation. It's not clear that those conversations are [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=457.86s)]
*  moving the Israeli prime minister, right? And these conversations predate [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=461.02s)]
*  the last 24 hours or last week because we had quite similar conversations [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  relating to Gaza. US officials right up to the president saying you need to [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=468.1s)]
*  take more attention, for instance, to avoid civilian casualties. And yet [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=472.06s)]
*  we've seen those strikes continue and many more civilian casualties down [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=476.26000000000005s)]
*  there. So listen, the US and Israel, they certainly talk, they communicate at [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=480.38s)]
*  the military to military level. That said, US officials and US military [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=485.06s)]
*  officials I speak with are making quite clear they're not involved in this [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=489.3s)]
*  operation, much as they made quite clear they were not involved in the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=493.5s)]
*  strike that killed Nasrallah. And there's a reason for that, right? I mean, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=496.9s)]
*  one, this is Israel's operation. It's making a decision to move forward in a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=500.7s)]
*  way that, frankly, the US president would prefer they to try diplomacy first, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=505.41999999999996s)]
*  it seems, based on his public comments and all the diplomatic capital that the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=510.17999999999995s)]
*  US invested prior to this. So listen, based on the facts and what is visible, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=513.54s)]
*  there continues to be daylight between US and Israeli officials. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=519.66s)]
*  Two things can be clear at the same time. Well, two things can be the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=522.62s)]
*  position that the US wants to take at the same time. One is that they have [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=529.26s)]
*  put out a statement saying that Israel has the right to defend itself from [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=534.22s)]
*  threats from terrorist groups. At the same time, they want to see a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=537.86s)]
*  diplomatic solution to not just what's going on here with Lebanon, but [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=542.0600000000001s)]
*  what is going on, of course, in Gaza. And I just wonder, does this Biden [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=547.86s)]
*  administration have any time to get a result, a win out of this, as far as [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  they are concerned? No, in the simplest terms. I mean, the election's a month [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=559.22s)]
*  away, and then the inauguration is a couple months after that, right? So you [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=562.5s)]
*  could argue that you have three months, right, till a new president is in place. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=565.98s)]
*  And it seems that the Israeli prime minister has calculated that during that [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=571.1800000000001s)]
*  time period, I don't want to say free reign, but he has more reign to push [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=575.26s)]
*  forward. And success informs the next decision, right? It strikes me that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=580.74s)]
*  Israel feels following these operations against Hezbollah, including killing [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=585.5s)]
*  Nasrallah, that they, you know, he's got a track record to work on, and now he's [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=589.02s)]
*  going to move forward. But it's interesting, the statement you said, you [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=592.62s)]
*  know, that military action can help or perhaps enable a solution, but it can't [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=595.46s)]
*  be the solution by itself. That statement could apply to any, you know, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=601.0999999999999s)]
*  dozens of situations we've been in over the last 20 years, right, whether it be [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=604.8199999999999s)]
*  with Lebanon, with Gaza, or with the West Bank or a two state solution. And you [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=608.14s)]
*  just haven't, you haven't narrowed that gap, right? And you haven't narrowed that [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=613.02s)]
*  gap, frankly, not just between Israelis and Palestinians, between the US and [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=616.9399999999999s)]
*  this Israeli government, right? Because they've been they've been pushing for [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=621.2199999999999s)]
*  something along those lines and staying quite publicly, but have not been able to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=623.9s)]
*  move, it seems, the Israeli prime minister. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=627.5s)]
*  It's good to have you. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SesYnLr7r6E&t=629.54s)]
