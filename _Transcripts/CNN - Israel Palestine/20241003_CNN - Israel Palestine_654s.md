# 'We don't want to see a repeat of Gaza in Lebanon' warns minister as new Israeli strikes hit Beirut
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8)
*  Well, really, it's hard to explain what's happening. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=0.0s)]
*  All I can say is that Beirut is under fire and the nation is in crisis mode. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=4.72s)]
*  The heart of Beirut, as Romana described it, she gave a very clear description, very specific [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  description about what happened last night. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=18.28s)]
*  And this has gone far and beyond what happened in 2006. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=22.7s)]
*  This is the closest it can get to civilian areas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=27.66s)]
*  It is, I live a mile and a half away from the place that was bombed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=33.18s)]
*  I heard it. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=38.34s)]
*  I felt it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=39.34s)]
*  My kids were terrified. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=40.34s)]
*  All my neighbors were, you know, trying to move around the area, not knowing really what [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=42.74s)]
*  the next target is going to be. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  Most importantly is that it was less than two miles away from the from the government [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=50.54s)]
*  the Palace, where we as a cabinet operate, where our prime minister is, where we do our [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=56.78s)]
*  work as a government. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=64.94s)]
*  And that was terrifying from a political point of view, from a security point of view. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=66.82s)]
*  And up till now, you know, us as a government don't have, I mean, we do have the intelligence [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=73.14s)]
*  we gather, the intelligence. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=80.06s)]
*  But when such targets are being hit by the Israelis, we can't really understand why they [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=81.66000000000001s)]
*  did it, given the fact that this was a medical operation office linked some way or another [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=88.9s)]
*  to Hezbollah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  But for us, it was a civilian building, everybody in it was civilian. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  There was not a bit or a piece of anything that relates to a military presence. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=102.9s)]
*  Minister, this is quite important because Israel says this war is against Hezbollah [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=108.9s)]
*  and not Lebanon as a whole. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=115.30000000000001s)]
*  But where you sit from right now, what is your take on this war? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=118.34s)]
*  My take on this war is that, you know, this war has to end immediately. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  I mean, myself as Minister of Economy from day one when the war started in Gaza, I sent [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=134.7s)]
*  a lot of messages very clear to everybody involved, including the international community, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=140.89999999999998s)]
*  that Lebanon cannot tolerate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=147.94s)]
*  Lebanon was already in a very difficult place before this war started. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=151.01999999999998s)]
*  Everybody knows the economy situation in Lebanon was in a very difficult place. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=156.06s)]
*  Everybody knows that after the Beirut port explosion, after the economic clash, you know, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=161.66000000000003s)]
*  the country has been struggling for over four years. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=167.22s)]
*  This war just came to devastate. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=170.62s)]
*  It's devastating the country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=172.58s)]
*  It's creating more instability. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=174.58s)]
*  I'm not just talking about the economy. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=178.54000000000002s)]
*  I'm talking about a million, 200,000 people displaced today. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=180.3s)]
*  It's an unprecedented displacement activity that happened in any country in the world [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=185.86s)]
*  in less than five days. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=192.3s)]
*  We have hospitals filled with people, schools filled with people, people sleeping on the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=194.02s)]
*  street. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=199.22000000000003s)]
*  And this war keeps going. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=200.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, the way I see it is that this war has no goal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=203.66000000000003s)]
*  It's just destroying the country and it's just taking it to a place where it's very [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=210.14s)]
*  difficult to come from. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  What are your top priorities? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=217.29999999999998s)]
*  What are you in need of the most right now? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=218.5s)]
*  So definitely we have had a major meeting, a flash appeal meeting with donor countries [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=223.5s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=232.02s)]
*  And we asked for about $400 million plus for the remainder of this year for aid and assistance [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=233.78s)]
*  to cover all the displaced people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=242.86s)]
*  We received so far from all the donor countries $200 million. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=247.18s)]
*  In addition to that, we have received $100 million as well from the United Arab Emirates [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=254.82000000000002s)]
*  We've been receiving aid from many Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Pakistan, many [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=261.02000000000004s)]
*  other countries are pouring in aid into Lebanon because it's much needed in this situation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=267.98s)]
*  However, the most important thing to focus on is that despite the fact that we might [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=274.7s)]
*  get the aid we need, we need a lot of stuff that not just relates to medical aid. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=280.5s)]
*  Today we have serious conditions of hundreds of thousands of kids that are in the streets, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=285.58s)]
*  that are in shelters. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=291.97999999999996s)]
*  They need proper nutrition. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  They need proper hygiene. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=295.53999999999996s)]
*  We need bedding. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  We are getting close to the winter season, which is going to make it even more difficult [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=299.9s)]
*  on the people that are displaced. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=304.02s)]
*  And excuse me, sorry to say as well that this issue is not a matter of a month or two. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  This is going to be a long term issue. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=314.14s)]
*  We're looking at one to two, three years maybe because those displaced people will not return [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=317.18s)]
*  to their homes even if there was a ceasefire tomorrow and a peaceful resolution because [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=323.02s)]
*  we need to rebuild their towns, their villages. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=327.94s)]
*  We need to provide peaceful conditions for them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=330.94s)]
*  So we are really in a very complicated operation now to take care of all those people, let [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=334.56s)]
*  alone the fact that Lebanon has over a million five hundred thousand Syrian refugees that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=342.34s)]
*  are still in Lebanon. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=349.62s)]
*  So no matter how I try to explain how difficult the situation is, it goes way beyond what [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=351.9s)]
*  we can really describe as going on today. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  And I hear you and I can hear that just generally the overall impacts already in the infrastructure [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=363.82s)]
*  and the impacts on people. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=369.92s)]
*  And you were talking about a ceasefire and how important that is going to be to try and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=370.92s)]
*  secure. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=376.04s)]
*  But in fact, there were hopes for a ceasefire. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=377.04s)]
*  It was supported by U.S. allies and that was ahead of Hassan Nasrallah's assassination. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=380.08s)]
*  The Lebanese foreign minister spoke to Christian Amman-Paul. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=385.76s)]
*  I want you to take a listen to what he had to say. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=389.0s)]
*  Are you saying Hassan Nasrallah had agreed to a ceasefire just moments before he was [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=392.56s)]
*  assassinated? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=397.96s)]
*  He agreed, yes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=401.56s)]
*  We agreed completely. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=402.88s)]
*  Lebanon agreed to ceasefire by consulting with Hezbollah. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=403.88s)]
*  The speaker, Mr. Birri, consulted with Hezbollah and we informed the Americans and the French [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  that what happened. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=416.2s)]
*  And they told us that Mr. Netanyahu also agreed on the statement that was issued by both presidents. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=418.76s)]
*  Mr. Minister, with this startling revelation, frankly, that a ceasefire was imminent and [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  we're sitting here today talking about how long this will last. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=434.76000000000005s)]
*  The question is, are there any lines of communication open right now with Israel and the Lebanese [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=438.44s)]
*  government? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=444.04s)]
*  Well, to be to be quite frank, I know that the discussions have been ongoing since the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=447.04s)]
*  United Nations General Assembly meetings on the highest level through the United States [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=453.72s)]
*  administration. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=458.68s)]
*  And Secretary Blinken has made it very clear he met several times with our minister of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=460.24s)]
*  foreign affairs, whom we just heard. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=467.0s)]
*  And the message was communicated from the United States that Lebanon wants a ceasefire. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=470.12s)]
*  And we got the reply that, you know, the Israeli side has opened up for a ceasefire discussion [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=477.8s)]
*  seriously. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=484.04s)]
*  But the sarcastic part about all that is that we keep talking about the ceasefire as Lebanon, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=485.32s)]
*  every time in Lebanon, is being bombed 24 seven with like a K, you know, drones flying [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=493.36s)]
*  over the city 24 seven. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=500.68s)]
*  We can see them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=503.32s)]
*  We can hear them preparing for the next target. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=504.32s)]
*  So it's it's we don't want to see a repeat of Gaza in Lebanon. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=507.0s)]
*  We don't because we've heard a ceasefire, you know, discussion in Gaza for a year. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=511.88s)]
*  But seriously now from the Lebanese side, all the Lebanese entities said that we want [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=517.88s)]
*  a ceasefire. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=523.6s)]
*  So, so, Minister, here's my last question. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=524.6s)]
*  You know, Iran and Israel have been in this horrifying retaliatory cycle for quite some [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=530.2s)]
*  time. There is a lot of worries about what this means regionally, whether we are in a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=536.64s)]
*  regional war, we are whether we are on the brink of regional war. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=540.76s)]
*  You've just described that the longer this continues, you're turning from emergency mode, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=544.4s)]
*  which you've been in for the past few years, into something a lot more serious. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=550.1199999999999s)]
*  How are you playing out these potential scenarios that could play out in the next few weeks [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=554.3399999999999s)]
*  or months? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  It is definitely a turning point. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=564.72s)]
*  It's definitely a serious historic moment for the Middle East and for Lebanon. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=566.6s)]
*  I think, you know, Lebanon needs to be very smart, very clever. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=572.32s)]
*  I'm talking on all fronts, including the government, including all political parties, with Hezbollah [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=576.64s)]
*  included. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=582.76s)]
*  We need to find a proper table, a proper seat on the table for Lebanon on the plan that [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=584.12s)]
*  is being cooked from the international community for what is being called the new Middle East. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ddhuOJK0Q8&t=590.4s)]
