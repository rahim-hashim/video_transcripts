# Netanyahu reacts to Schumer calling him an 'obstacle' to peace
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8)
*  Here with me now is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining me. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=3.2s)]
*  Let's start with that potential deal, sir. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  100 hostages about are still being held by Hamas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=7.84s)]
*  You're sending that negotiating team to Qatar in the coming days [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=12.08s)]
*  to talk about a potential deal. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=17.04s)]
*  Free hostages in exchange for a six week pause in fighting. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=18.96s)]
*  As you know, Hamas is demanding the release of hundreds of Palestinian [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=23.32s)]
*  prisoners in exchange for roughly 40 female hostages. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=26.68s)]
*  Are you open to that? Are you close to a deal? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=30.48s)]
*  Well, time will tell, but Hamas is an outlandish demands and I'm not [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=37.12s)]
*  itemizing every one of them now makes that deal a lot more difficult. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=42.28s)]
*  But we're going to keep on trying because we want those hostages back. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=46.84s)]
*  We understand also that the one thing that gets Hamas to give them [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=50.56s)]
*  is to give these hostages to us is the continued military pressure [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=54.52s)]
*  that we're applying there. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  So we're going to continue military pressure and we're going to continue [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=60.88s)]
*  to try to get those hostages out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=64.64s)]
*  And we've succeeded already in bringing half of them out. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=66.36s)]
*  I hope we continue along that same course. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about what happened here in the U.S. this week. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=71.72s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer gave a pivotal speech and said, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=74.16s)]
*  you have lost your way and called you an obstacle to peace. Take a listen. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=78.56s)]
*  The Netanyahu coalition no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7th. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=85.52s)]
*  And I believe that holding a new election, once the war starts to wind down, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  would give Israelis an opportunity to express their vision [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=97.24s)]
*  for the postwar future. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=101.72s)]
*  Chuck Schumer is the highest ranking Jewish elected official here in America, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=104.28s)]
*  a staunch supporter of Israel. What's your response? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=108.44s)]
*  I think what he said is totally inappropriate. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=115.52s)]
*  It's inappropriate for to go to a sister democracy [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=118.52s)]
*  and try to replace the elected leadership there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  That's something that Israel, the Israeli public does on its own. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=124.92s)]
*  We're not a banana republic. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=128.2s)]
*  I think the only government that we should be working on to bring down now [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=129.8s)]
*  is the terrorist tyranny in Gaza, the Hamas tyranny [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=133.16s)]
*  that murdered over a thousand Israelis, including some dozens of Americans [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=137.72s)]
*  and is holding Americans and Israelis hostage. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=142.96s)]
*  That's what we should be focused on. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=145.88s)]
*  And as far as what Senator Schumer said, the majority of Israelis [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=147.24s)]
*  support our governments. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=151.52s)]
*  Eighty two percent of Americans support Israel instead of Hamas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=153.24s)]
*  But the majority of Israelis support the policies that we're leading. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=156.68s)]
*  Go into Rafah, destroy the remaining Hamas terrorist battalions, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=160.68s)]
*  make sure that we don't put into Gaza instead of Hamas [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=165.0s)]
*  the Palestinian authority that educates their children towards terrorism [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  and the annihilation of Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=171.4s)]
*  And and also an enormous majority here, including 99 [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=173.28s)]
*  Knesset members to nine oppose the idea of ramming down [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=178.84s)]
*  a Palestinian state down our throats. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=182.96s)]
*  I want to get to you know, the majority of Israelis. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=184.84s)]
*  This is a wake up call to Senator Schumer. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=187.0s)]
*  The majority of Israelis support the policies of my government. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=189.28s)]
*  It's not a fringe government. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=192.72s)]
*  It represents the policies supported by the majority of the people. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=193.96s)]
*  If Senator Schumer opposes these policies, he's not opposing me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=197.56s)]
*  He's opposing the people of Israel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=201.36s)]
*  OK, I'm going to get to some of the polls that you cited in one moment, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=202.96s)]
*  but I just want to make sure that our viewers understand that Chuck Schumer [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=205.88s)]
*  gave the big speech, but he has support [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=209.88s)]
*  in many ways from the president of the United States. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=213.72s)]
*  President Biden is a self-described Zionist. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=216.52s)]
*  Even he is starting to distance himself from the way you are handling the war. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=219.12s)]
*  He called what Schumer said a good speech. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=224.36s)]
*  He said that he shared the concern of many Americans. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=227.44s)]
*  They aren't criticizing Israel. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=231.8s)]
*  They're criticizing you and your right wing coalition. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=233.48s)]
*  Dana, there is a fallacy that is being perpetrated here, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=240.56s)]
*  and you should take polls, you have your own polls and check whether the people of Israel [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=244.24s)]
*  support the policies that I'm being criticized for, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=248.6s)]
*  that is supporting the policies of going into Rafa, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=251.84s)]
*  destroying a quarter of the remaining Hamas terrorist army. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=254.96s)]
*  That's like leaving a quarter of the Nazi terrorist army in Germany and saying, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  no, we're not going to finish the last quarter and we're not going into Berlin. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=265.0s)]
*  Most Israelis overwhelmingly support the position that we have to go in. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=268.84s)]
*  They oppose the idea of ramming down a two-state solution [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=272.8s)]
*  or a terrorist state against their will, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  because they think that this will endanger Israel's future. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=279.52s)]
*  They support those policies that I'm putting forward. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=283.32s)]
*  And to present that as something that is, I'm an outlier, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=287.12s)]
*  it doesn't represent the majority of the people of Israel, is simply a fallacy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=290.48s)]
*  And I'll tell you the other fallacy is, they're saying, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=293.76s)]
*  well, most Palestinians don't support the Hamas massacre. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=296.4s)]
*  In fact, 85% of the Palestinians do support, unfortunately, the Hamas massacre. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=300.12s)]
*  So they've got two fallacies here. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=305.08s)]
*  And you can readily check that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=307.32s)]
*  The majority of Israelis support the policies that I have on prosecuting the war, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=308.8s)]
*  which is what I'm being criticized for. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=313.08s)]
*  So it's not just me, it's the people of Israel who believe [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=315.16s)]
*  that we have to have this resolute victory to assure our future. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=318.44s)]
*  And unfortunately, we have the Palestinians that haven't aligned themselves with peace yet. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=321.64000000000004s)]
*  It's the way that you're prosecuting the war. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  So I'm going to get to that in one minute. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=327.48s)]
*  But I just want to add a little bit of sort of context to the way [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  that the Biden administration is pushing back. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  Another way is that the U.S. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  intelligence community warned that, quote, distrust of Netanyahu's ability [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  to rule has deepened and broadened across the public. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=343.28s)]
*  And then back to the polls, you're talking about support for the idea of toppling Hamas. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=346.79999999999995s)]
*  That makes perfect sense. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  There were other polls in Israel, three major Israeli television stations [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=354.88s)]
*  that said what Israelis also support are early elections. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=359.91999999999996s)]
*  That's what I really want to focus on here is Senator Schumer not calling to sort of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  topple the government, but specifically says when the war winds down, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=369.16s)]
*  will you commit to calling new elections? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=374.16s)]
*  That's my question. Will you? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=376.72s)]
*  Dana, two thirds. First of all, what you said is wrong. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=382.16s)]
*  The vast majority of Israelis oppose early elections until the war doesn't end. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=385.44000000000005s)]
*  We've just had many polls on that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=391.08000000000004s)]
*  Look, a lot of the polls are, you know, are twisted. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=392.8s)]
*  Channel 12 says 64 percent of Israelis support early elections. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=395.52s)]
*  But all polls show that's not. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=400.96s)]
*  No, I'm afraid they asked them the question, do you support it during the war? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  And they said no. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=407.64s)]
*  That's not what Schumer is calling for. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  He's calling for new elections when the war winds down. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=410.08s)]
*  Well, we'll see when we win the war. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=416.44s)]
*  And until we win the war, I think Israelis understand that if we were to have [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=418.96s)]
*  elections now before the war is one resoundingly one, we would have at least [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=423.04s)]
*  six months of national paralysis, which means we would lose the war. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=428.68s)]
*  If we don't win the war, we lose the war. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=432.36s)]
*  And that would be not only a defeat for Israel, but a defeat for America, too, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=434.0s)]
*  because our victory is your victory. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=438.44s)]
*  We're fighting these barbarians that are not really threatening the survival of Israel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=440.64s)]
*  But threatening everything that we hold dear together. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=444.44s)]
*  Will you commit to new elections? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=448.36s)]
*  I think that's something for the Israeli public to decide. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=449.76s)]
*  But it's not it's not something. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=452.2s)]
*  No, it's look, that's something for the Israeli people to decide. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=454.32s)]
*  I think it's ridiculous to talk about it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=457.32s)]
*  It's like after 9-11, you know, after 9-11, you're in the midst of fighting [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=459.32s)]
*  the war against Al Qaeda and an Israeli would say, you know, what we need now [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=463.52s)]
*  is either new elections in the US or if your system doesn't allow them, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  President Bush should resign and we should have an alternative leader. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=472.24s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxI0QjxJs8&t=475.12s)]
