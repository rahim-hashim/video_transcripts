# Drone footage of war-torn Gaza shows immense destruction
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg)
*  Ben, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza seems to be growing worse by the hour. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=0.0s)]
*  In fact, Wolf, the UN is describing it as dire, and I think the UN is rather understating [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=5.16s)]
*  the case. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=13.58s)]
*  It sounds by all accounts that it's catastrophic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=14.58s)]
*  In addition to the fact that the death toll in Gaza has now exceeded 1,500, the health [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=17.44s)]
*  system by all accounts, and according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, is in a state [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=24.2s)]
*  of collapse. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=29.28s)]
*  All the things you need to run a hospital are slowly running out. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=30.68s)]
*  The fuel for the generators that keep the hospitals running, medicine, basic supplies [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  are simply not being replenished. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  And therefore, we're seeing that, for instance, in hospitals all around Gaza, many of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=44.52s)]
*  injured are simply put on the floor in the corridors. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=50.74s)]
*  There are no beds left. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=54.0s)]
*  The operating theaters are beyond capacity. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=55.88s)]
*  Now, according to the United Nations, there are 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza who now [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=59.080000000000005s)]
*  have no access to health care, partially because of the fighting, but partially because the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  health workers and all the facilities are being focused on treating the injured. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=71.8s)]
*  Now, speaking of the injured, earlier this evening our colleague Christiane Amanpour [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=77.36s)]
*  spoke to Dr. Hassan Abou Sitte, who's a Palestinian-British doctor who has been going to Gaza regularly. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=82.78s)]
*  I've interviewed him many times also in operating theaters while he's actually operating on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=89.78s)]
*  the injured, and he says that among the wounded, 30 to 40 percent of them are children. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=95.54s)]
*  And certainly there is a sense in Gaza that at this point people feel that the injured [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=103.7s)]
*  the ordinary civilians, they are simply being abandoned. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=112.06s)]
*  No one cries over us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=118.34s)]
*  There's no chivalry, no feelings, hearts are dead. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=120.18s)]
*  Only shocks and body parts remain. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=124.14s)]
*  People are blind to this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=126.82000000000001s)]
*  People can't find food in their homes, and there is an extremely tough social condition [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=128.26s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=132.62s)]
*  Siege above the siege. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=134.26s)]
*  And all of this is happening because of the siege. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=135.74s)]
*  Where should our people go? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=138.62s)]
*  We've been besieged for 18 years. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=140.1s)]
*  Where should we go? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=142.74s)]
*  And of course, where can they go? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=145.9s)]
*  They cannot go anywhere. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  The border to Egypt is closed. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=149.74s)]
*  They can't go into Israel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=151.74s)]
*  The United States and other European powers are trying to figure out some sort of humanitarian [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=153.22s)]
*  corridor, so Palestinian civilians who have to can get out of Gaza, but at this point [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=158.86s)]
*  no progress on that front. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2Ntxk_ZQTg&t=164.98000000000002s)]
