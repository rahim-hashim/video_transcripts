# Israel's president: Hamas' 'passive-aggressive' approach is an attempt to drive Israel 'crazy'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ)
*  This is a really precarious moment in Israel's history right now, as I'm sure you and I agree. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's been at war now for more than 50 days against Hamas, given what happened back on October 7th, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  three days into this temporary truce right now. How meaningful is it, Mr. President, right now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=11.44s)]
*  for Israelis to see at least some good news, some of the hostages being reunited with their families? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=17.36s)]
*  It is extremely important because we see, we see human beings who are in the abyss [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  without knowing their whereabouts and their fate, as well as the fact that they themselves are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=31.6s)]
*  totally secluded and disconnected from the rest of the world. The fact that you see young girls, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=37.36s)]
*  a young boy or grandmothers walking through and going to Israeli hospitals and coming back and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=44.72s)]
*  meeting their families is a huge emotional storm and something that gives us happiness, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=52.96s)]
*  but of course happiness with a lot of sorrow in it because there are at least 200 hostages still [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=62.4s)]
*  held out there in Hamas, under Hamas du Res, somewhere in in bunkers, somewhere without knowing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=70.4s)]
*  how they live and what they're aware about. Some family torn apart. Most of the hostages that were [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=78.16s)]
*  released have still family members left behind, tearing the families apart and as you can see, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=85.04s)]
*  so, over the last few days, Hamas is treading on our psychology with a kind of a [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=92.16s)]
*  passive-aggressive approach which wants to drive us as a nation crazy because of the emotions [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=99.84s)]
*  filled and because of the extreme pain and worry of so many relatives to their friends and family [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=106.32s)]
*  who are out there in Gaza. As you know, Israel's defense minister, Yoav Galant, said yesterday, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=113.27999999999999s)]
*  I'm quoting him now, any further negotiations will be held under fire. Is he effectively closing [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  the door to extending the truce? So we have to first remember that there are a few more days of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=126.88s)]
*  release of the hostages, whilst Israel is releasing terrorists who are charged and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  prisoned for terror activities, including taking lives of people or threatening to take lives of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=142.72s)]
*  people and this is a very gruesome process. So I don't want to speak about the next step but it is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=150.0s)]
*  clear to us that if we want to prevent further terror against Israel from Gaza and change the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=157.44s)]
*  future of the Middle East and the way the Palestinians have some hope, the only way to do [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=164.96s)]
*  it in a human way in order to protect the human values in the region is by uprooting Hamas and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=171.04s)]
*  that will lead to the fact that we have to take further action and undermine Hamas's military [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=178.96s)]
*  capabilities. I'm anxious to get your thought. If Hamas agrees to another day, another few days, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=185.84s)]
*  of this truce in order to release more Israeli hostages, should Israel accept that? So that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  is already being negotiated. First of all, it was agreed in the original agreement, which has been [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=198.4s)]
*  violated constantly by Hamas but still implemented piecemeal, that if they bring another 10 prisoners [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=205.12s)]
*  or so, the exact number of courses in the agreement itself, there will be an extension [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=213.44s)]
*  of another day of humanitarian pause. So that is already agreed. They can definitely bring many [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=219.84s)]
*  more hostages and release them. They kind of said that they don't know where the whereabouts are. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=226.8s)]
*  That looks to us totally false because they've been controlling Gaza to the last iota for the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  last 20 odd years in a very cruel regime that didn't let anybody move without their permission. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=240.4s)]
*  So that is why I truly hope that in this instance they will release more and more [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=247.6s)]
*  and they will get more and more humanitarian pauses. As to what happens afterwards, it is [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=253.44s)]
*  clear that we intend to complete the task, meaning undermine the military capabilities of Hamas [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=259.92s)]
*  as an entity and enable a different future for those who live near the border, for Israelis and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=267.36s)]
*  Palestinians, for the ability to undermine this empire of evil which operates from Tehran and of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  course impacts the entire region. So I just want to be precise, Mr. President, in order to get more [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  Israeli hostages released, do you think Israel should agree to extend the truce? So far the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=285.68s)]
*  agreement speaks about... The agreement was for four days. But it says specifically that any additional [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=293.92s)]
*  ten or so hostages released, there will be another day of humanitarian pause and that is what is being [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=300.16s)]
*  implemented. As to what happens next, there is a Qatari delegation in Israel today and I think [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=308.16s)]
*  they're talking to the relevant authorities in the Israeli government as to the next phase. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=315.36s)]
*  So you are open to extending the truce? So again, the way you interpret the word truce is complicated. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=322.0s)]
*  We've already agreed, we made it public, that if above the initial four days there's a release [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=329.76s)]
*  of further prisoners, ten per day or something, ten, eleven, I don't have the exact numbers, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=337.52s)]
*  we will extend the humanitarian pause, meaning the truce. That's the way... You call it a pause? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=344.24s)]
*  Yes. But our clear intention is to go in and complete the job because we must not enable this [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=351.12s)]
*  base of terror, this platform of terror, which was taken over by cruel coup d'etat in 2007 [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=360.4s)]
*  by Hamas to continue. And how would you expect anybody who went through these horrific torments [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=367.68s)]
*  and horrific scene and this barbaric attack on October 7th with rape and torture and beheading [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=374.64s)]
*  and chopping and mutilating bodies and abducting hostages, how do you expect anybody to go back [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=381.84s)]
*  there if there's no complete end to this threat? So let's talk a little bit about looking down [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=391.04s)]
*  the road. After this war with Hamas, you have said Israel, and I'm quoting you now, can't leave a [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=396.96s)]
*  vacuum in Gaza. So will Gaza be governed by a revitalized Palestinian authority as President [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=402.72s)]
*  Biden has proposed? So here, this is something really important to go into and discuss because [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  people have to be serious. If we want to prevent the recurrence of further terror, if we want to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=416.88000000000005s)]
*  go into a stable horizon in the region, we have to be lucid about it. Is there any force in the world, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  in the region, which is willing to take over and run the place in terms of the security [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=431.84s)]
*  and preventing further horrors, sadistic and barbaric jihadist activity? Somebody has to say [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=438.0s)]
*  who it's going to be when there are nations who say we won't have boots on the ground, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=445.36s)]
*  when there are nations who say of course not, we leave the dirty job to you guys. So when Israel says [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=450.32s)]
*  right now the security and well-being of this place in terms of this security element, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=456.96s)]
*  meaning fighting terror, enforcing law and order, adjudicating and so forth, will stay in Israeli [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=462.96s)]
*  hands until there is an agreement. One has to build the alternative. The alternative needs to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  be discussed in various key places and see what's next. In the interim, there has to be a major [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  humanitarian aid and a major humanitarian effort. In this respect, for example, I commend the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=484.08s)]
*  hospital which is being built now in Rafah by the United Arab Emirates. There are other countries [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=491.52s)]
*  who are making similar efforts and we commend them as well, but the most advanced projects so far, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=498.47999999999996s)]
*  for example, for another new hospital in the Gaza Strip, is done by United Arab Emirates and yesterday [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  trucks came in in order to build this hospital in Rafah. So there should be an overall effort [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=512.48s)]
*  to make something that makes sense for the future and well-being of Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=520.16s)]
*  So what should the governing authority of Gaza be after this Israel-Hamas war, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=525.76s)]
*  if it's not the Palestinian authority? So I've been saying a lot, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  many, many times and I'll say it again, this is not only a war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  This is actually a war that defends the real values of liberal and democratic countries or [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=542.48s)]
*  countries who believe in the rules of the family of nations as opposed to an empire of evil, which [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=551.36s)]
*  is an empire of jihadists, which believe only in eradicating all of us out of here, not only Jews, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=557.6s)]
*  but also Christians and the next will be Europe and the United States. So that is what the war is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=565.12s)]
*  all about and therefore how you come out of the war, meaning how do you make sure that what will [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=570.64s)]
*  come out of the war will promise regional security and stability, will promise peace, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=577.84s)]
*  or let's say ceasing of fire and terror. This is the key. This has to be analyzed clearly and in [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=584.32s)]
*  a very punctual way, not slogans. I heard President Biden's speech on Friday from his vacation and I [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=593.12s)]
*  truly welcomed these words. I mean these were important words as he spoke about the fact that [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=602.72s)]
*  there is an empire of evil which wants to undermine all the peace processes in the region. It is clear [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=608.16s)]
*  that what Hamas did under the instructions of Iran is to undermine the ability of further peace [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=614.8s)]
*  agreements following the Abraham Accords, also peace agreement with Saudi Arabia and [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=622.08s)]
*  offering a huge huge connection between Europe all the way down to Australia. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBoxkeoi6IQ&t=627.76s)]
