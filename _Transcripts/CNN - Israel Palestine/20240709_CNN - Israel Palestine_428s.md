# 'We have 3 minutes': CNN goes inside one of most dangerous places in northern Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc)
*  Israel is pressing ahead with a major military offensive in Gaza City as Hamas warns the attacks could send ceasefire efforts [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=0.0s)]
*  Back to square one [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=7.36s)]
*  Israeli forces report close quarters combat with Hamas fighters saying they are destroying terrorist infrastructure [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=8.96s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of people meantime are fleeing their homes once again under yet new evacuation orders [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=15.6s)]
*  Gaza civil defense says bodies are trapped under buildings and lying in the streets [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=22.8s)]
*  But it's just too dangerous for crews to try and retrieve them [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=27.28s)]
*  The Palestinian Red Crescent says all of its medical clinics in Gaza are in Gaza City are now out of service [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=30.6s)]
*  You want to go to our Jeremy Diamond now for more who's live for us in Jerusalem? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  You know what a nightmare repeating itself here again. I mean evacuations ordered and again [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=42.2s)]
*  It's a familiar horror right where the heck do these people go? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  What more are you learning about exactly the Israeli operation that is underway and what it means for civilians? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=50.6s)]
*  Well, you're right Paula tens of thousands of Palestinians are once again on the move [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=58.28s)]
*  We have seen over the course of just the last week evacuation orders for parts of Khan Yunis and then in northern Gaza [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  several evacuation orders in different neighborhoods of Gaza City and that is where the Israeli military has been concentrating its [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=69.64s)]
*  military operations over the last 48 hours or so inside Gaza City neighborhoods where the Israeli military says that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=77.28s)]
*  Hamas has returned to areas that the Israeli military had previously cleared [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=85.48s)]
*  And that is what we are continuing to see in Gaza absent a long-term strategy for the governance an alternative to Hamas's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=90.52s)]
*  Governance in in Gaza the Israeli military going back into areas that it had previously [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=98.4s)]
*  withdrawn from and not only is that resulting in increased fighting increased artillery shelling airstrikes [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=103.28s)]
*  But also of course the impact to civilians not only those who are killed and wounded in the fighting [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=109.16s)]
*  rescue workers having trouble actually reaching the dead and the wounded as a result of the heavy fighting and then of course as we were talking about [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=114.6s)]
*  the tens of thousands hundreds of thousands in some cases of people who are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=121.84s)]
*  Moving to areas of central Gaza to that Al Mawasi coastal area where they are simply finding that there are not enough [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=127.88s)]
*  Resources for the number of people who are currently displaced in Gaza even things like tents are running in short supply [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=134.24s)]
*  In Gaza at the moment and for now the only salve that they could potentially get is if indeed there is a ceasefire agreement [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=141.44s)]
*  We are seeing those negotiations [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=148.56s)]
*  Continuing this week in Cairo as well as in Doha cutter, but for now no deal as of yet [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=150.28s)]
*  You know the other aspect here that you've been following closely [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=155.4s)]
*  It has been whether or not this will also be a conflict on another front Israel's northern border. What did you learn by visiting? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  Well late last last week we traveled to Stula [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=165.6s)]
*  Which is just a few hundred feet away from the Lebanese border to get a sense of just how tense things are there and to see some of the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=168.64s)]
*  destruction wrought by Hezbollah's anti-tank missiles [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=175.24s)]
*  They're gonna see us right when we get up there and we have three minutes [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=179.76s)]
*  Colonel Jordan Hertzberg is talking about Hezbollah after three minutes though. They can start the fire. So we're very quick [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=183.76s)]
*  He's taking us to an Israeli community on the front lines of Israel's simmering conflict with the Lebanese militant group up a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  winding mountain road past a roadblock in a security fence and into the village of Stula [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=197.24s)]
*  Which sits right on the Lebanese border. We've just entered the village of Stula. This is a community of about 300 people normally [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=203.24s)]
*  But right now it's just an absolute ghost time [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=210.24s)]
*  The three-minute countdown starts as soon as we are within line of sight of southern Lebanon [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=213.24s)]
*  Look how close you are to the border here [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=219.24s)]
*  Where Hezbollah militants armed with anti-tank missiles are closely watching the border prepared to fire once again [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=221.24s)]
*  This house was hit fighting a high-tank missile right here [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=228.24s)]
*  Past the window [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=233.24s)]
*  Two homes one next to the other hit in the same attack [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=234.24s)]
*  According to the Israeli military [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=238.24s)]
*  This is one of the most dangerous places in northern Israel right now [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=240.24s)]
*  We're in Stula and you can see the Lebanese border just right across there across from those concrete barriers [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=243.24s)]
*  We're just a few hundred feet and what that means is that we are within range of those anti-tank guided missiles [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=249.24s)]
*  And that is exactly what has wrought this destruction on this civilian home [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=255.24s)]
*  The threat of anti-tank missiles is part of why Israel wants to fight back [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=259.24s)]
*  The threat of anti-tank missiles is part of why Israel wants to push Hezbollah back to the Latani River [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=264.24s)]
*  About 18 miles north of the border outside the range of those missiles [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=270.24s)]
*  Okay, we have 35 seconds [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=276.24s)]
*  We've been here for three minutes [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=279.24s)]
*  The colonel has been watching his watch the entire time that we've been here [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=280.24s)]
*  And now he's telling us it's time to go [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=284.24s)]
*  Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones at northern Israel since October 8th [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=288.24s)]
*  Israel has responded with airstrike after airstrike devastating parts of southern Lebanon [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=295.24s)]
*  Where more than 90,000 people have fled their homes since October [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=301.24s)]
*  In northern Israel about 60,000 Israelis have been displaced [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=307.24s)]
*  People like Ori Eliyahu and his nine dogs [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=311.24s)]
*  His grandfather was among the first people Israel settled in Shtula in the late 1960s [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=316.24s)]
*  And after spending his summers there as a child, Ori decided to move there [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=322.24s)]
*  Shtula is a special place for you [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=327.24s)]
*  It's my heart, to be honest [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=329.24s)]
*  If you could return to Shtula, you would? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=332.24s)]
*  Of course, I will return in the first moment I will be able to, yeah [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=334.24s)]
*  But he says that may not be the case for families with children [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=340.24s)]
*  I don't think that there is a condition that will make them come back [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=344.24s)]
*  Because whenever they know that Hezbollah is like Hamas can do what they did in October 7 [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=348.24s)]
*  And attack them, they won't be returned [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=353.24s)]
*  And there is no real solution because a big war might ruin everything [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=357.24s)]
*  A big war is exactly what the Israeli military is preparing for [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=361.24s)]
*  Our division has been training for this war for a long, long time [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=366.24s)]
*  Whether that war materializes is unclear [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=369.24s)]
*  But for Colonel Hertzberg, the objective is obvious [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=372.24s)]
*  Get Israel's northern residents back into their homes [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=375.24s)]
*  Whether it happens before major ground operation or after ground operation [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=379.24s)]
*  I can't tell you, I'm on a tactical level, I'm not at the political level or the policy level [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=384.24s)]
*  But the people are going to come back sooner than later [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=388.24s)]
*  And Paula, the situation along that border still remains very, very tense [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=394.24s)]
*  And it's not clear yet whether it will blow up into that all-out war that has been feared [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=398.24s)]
*  What we do know though is those ceasefire negotiations happening this week in Doha, Qatar [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=403.24s)]
*  They could not only unlock a ceasefire in Gaza [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=407.24s)]
*  But they could also potentially unlock a broader peace in the region [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=411.24s)]
*  Yeah, and as you pointed out in your report, tens of thousands of people on both sides of that border [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=414.24s)]
*  Want to get back to their lives [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=418.24s)]
*  It's obviously an agricultural hub as well [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=420.24s)]
*  And we will wait to see if there is progress on these ceasefire talks [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=422.24s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond for us, thanks so much, appreciate it [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWibxMDbMFc&t=425.24s)]
