# Weapons used by Hamas militants appear to be Russian or Chinese made
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc)
*  A special investigation here at CNN looking at the deadly weapons arsenal that Hamas had, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=0.0s)]
*  that they used to unleash terror and to slaughter all those innocent people. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=5.44s)]
*  What weapons did they use and where did they get them? Oren Lieberman is out front. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=9.76s)]
*  An entire arsenal on display. Weapons fashioned in Hamas's homegrown facilities, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=18.64s)]
*  but no less deadly. CNN analyzed dozens of photos and videos of Hamas militants during [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=25.6s)]
*  the surprise assault to identify the weapons used to kill at least 1200 people in Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=31.36s)]
*  The most important characteristic of the military equipment they have is that it's easily interchangeable, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  it's reliable, dependable, and you can get parts for it. Many, like this Soviet Bill 50 caliber [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=42.24s)]
*  machine gun, appear to be Russian or Chinese firearms, relics from previous wars that made [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=48.88s)]
*  their way into the hands of Hamas. Ubiquitous among many of the photos and videos, the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=54.32s)]
*  AvtoMot Kalashnikova, the AK-47, the preferred weapon for militant groups capable of spewing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=59.28s)]
*  automatic fire with horrific results. The assault rifles, along with the grenades carried by Hamas [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=65.28s)]
*  militants, made them deadly when they reached Israeli towns and villages near Gaza. All they're [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  trying to do is provide the shock effects, provide dependability, their weapons have to work, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=79.12s)]
*  so they're very rudimentary, but based on their training, based on how they operate them, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=84.32s)]
*  they are successful with them. Hamas's main weapon has long been their supply of rockets, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=89.44s)]
*  from short range to long range. The terror attack on Saturday morning began with a barrage of rocket [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=96.08s)]
*  fire. A smoke screen for the imminent attack. Thousands of rockets overwhelmed Israel's Iron [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=101.52s)]
*  Dome air defense system, a tactic Hamas has refined over the years. That's the capability [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=108.56s)]
*  the enemy, for Hamas, to fire them up against potentially commercial aircraft, and that I think [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=114.72s)]
*  is one of the major issues of these terrorist groups, if they have those kinds of weapons in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=121.92s)]
*  their hands. Hamas used paragliders to cross the Gaza border. The recreational vehicles are [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=126.4s)]
*  barely maneuverable and easy to target in the air, but in the chaos of the moment, the plan worked. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=131.76s)]
*  Some of the weapons and equipment were decidedly more low-tech. Israel built a complex underground [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=138.24s)]
*  barrier to stop tunnels from crossing the Gaza border, so Hamas used a bulldozer to tear down [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=143.68s)]
*  the above-ground fence. They are just looking to create chaos with the kind of equipment they have, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  and the equipment has got to be reliable. Worth noting that these are only the videos and the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  weapons we saw in the videos and the photos from the attack. We've seen them use other weapons in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=160.72s)]
*  the past, like anti-tank and anti-armor rockets or missiles, and Aaron, that's what makes a ground [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=166.32s)]
*  incursion by Israel such a difficult proposition. All right, Oren, thank you very much. With all of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=171.84s)]
*  that reporting on the weapons, I want to go now to Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Konrick as the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=179.6s)]
*  international spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces. Colonel, obviously welcome back to the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=183.84s)]
*  program. You heard Oren's report. Do you feel right now that the IDF knows what sort of an arsenal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  Hamas has right now, whether it be rockets and other sorts of weaponry? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=200.4s)]
*  Do you know the extent of the arsenal right now? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=204.48s)]
*  Hi, Oren. Thank you for having me again. I think that the story you just aired [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=209.84s)]
*  is a very comprehensive, interesting, and a well-done one, and I think that the short answer to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=214.72s)]
*  your question is no, we don't, and I think that we have to be extremely cautious and very humble [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=221.36s)]
*  in our approach for the next stage of operations because clearly our enemy has shown that they have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=229.12s)]
*  had the ability to acquire and train and use weapons that they haven't done before, and they [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=236.4s)]
*  fielded them, unfortunately, successfully on the battlefield. So we have to be very, very humble [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=243.12s)]
*  and strong, focused, and I would say aggressive in our approach against them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  So you talk about being aggressive in the next stages, even as you say you need to be humble. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=255.12s)]
*  You know, Israel obviously had issued that evacuation order for northern Gaza. The United [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=260.64s)]
*  Nations said it was a 24-hour deadline. Where are we in this? Are you able to give any sort of a sense [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=264.88s)]
*  of when Israel may move? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  When Israel may move? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=275.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's about 2 30 a.m. local time, so it's dark, and it's of course very difficult to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=281.12s)]
*  see exactly what's happening in the Gaza Strip, but we've been following throughout the day, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=289.04s)]
*  and we've been monitoring the movement, the mass movement of Palestinian civilians who, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=293.52s)]
*  I'm happy to say, many, many, I don't know exactly how many, but many, many have listened to our [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=298.96s)]
*  warnings and have indeed moved, evacuated themselves to the south, and that is very good [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=304.32s)]
*  for them and their families. I'm not going to put a timeline on, or time schedule, sorry, on our [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=310.0s)]
*  activities. I can only say that we are trying to do the right thing here. We're trying to get [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=317.84s)]
*  civilians out of the way because we are going to intensify the operations in and around Gaza City. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=323.6s)]
*  Whenever we will feel that the situation is [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=330.48s)]
*  tenable for military operations, I assume that that is when the operations will continue. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=333.92s)]
*  And you also, you did have some operations today. Obviously, those were more special forces back in [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=341.6s)]
*  there. Can you tell us anything about whether they were successful or what was accomplished? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=346.48s)]
*  Yeah, they were successful in the sense that they were able to find new intelligence and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=354.56s)]
*  shed a little bit more light on the very complex task we have of understanding who was taken [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=361.12s)]
*  hostage and who wasn't, who is dead and who might be missing, and then trying to piece together [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=368.96s)]
*  other sources of intelligence and building a more cohesive picture of where they are [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=375.52s)]
*  and who they are, and then of course supporting a plan on how to get them out. So yes, it was [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=382.96s)]
*  successful. We found intelligence that supports that, and of course that is a very high, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=389.2s)]
*  I would say number one priority for us is to find those people, get them back home to Israel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=395.2s)]
*  And Hamas claims that 13 of them, 13 Israeli hostages in Gaza, they say were killed, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=404.0s)]
*  they say were actually killed by IDF airstrikes in the past 24 hours. I know that one of your [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=409.03999999999996s)]
*  colleagues had said that Israeli intelligence was looking into it. Is there any truth to what [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=414.56s)]
*  Hamas is claiming? Well, Hamas is a lying, cowardly terrorist organization, and I don't think that [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  any of their statements are true. It is all propaganda, and they also said, I think it was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=428.4s)]
*  on the second or third day of the war, you'll forgive me for not keeping count of the days [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=436.24s)]
*  totally, but on the second or third day, they also said that they would start executing [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=441.2s)]
*  hostages and filming it if Israel doesn't stop targeting their facilities. So it's impossible [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=447.52s)]
*  to trust what they're saying, and we'll have to believe it only when we see it and when we have [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=456.0s)]
*  our intelligence that will prove it, but at the end of the day, Hamas is responsible, and Hamas [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  will pay a price. Colonel, thank you very much. I appreciate your time again. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyp03W2SXyc&t=468.88s)]
