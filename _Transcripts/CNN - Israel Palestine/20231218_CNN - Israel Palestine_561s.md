# See inside the largest tunnel found in Gaza, according to Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk)
*  Joining us now the Republican Governor of New Hampshire, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=0.0s)]
*  Kristen Nunu. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  And we do have something I want to share with you tonight [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=3.84s)]
*  on that, a new image of a tunnel tonight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=5.68s)]
*  So you're looking at this here and you can see how wide it is. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=7.58s)]
*  These images come from both the IDF and also Reuters journalists [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=10.28s)]
*  who were there to witness it. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=13.42s)]
*  The tunnel spans two and a half miles. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=15.38s)]
*  It reaches more than 160 feet underground and it is equipped [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=17.36s)]
*  with electricity, ventilation and communication systems. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=20.46s)]
*  It goes incredibly close to the Israeli border and can be used [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=24.2s)]
*  for large forces to move, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=27.96s)]
*  You can see this isn't a narrow thing at all. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=29.9s)]
*  Its discovery comes as this war is spreading beyond Israel's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=32.4s)]
*  borders. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  Another Iranian funded militia, the Houthis today claiming [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  responsibility for an attack on a ship in the Red Sea. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=41.18s)]
*  The USS Carney quickly responding to the ship's distress call. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=44.22s)]
*  But over the past two months, Houthi forces have been [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  involved in a number of attacks along the Red Sea. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=49.86s)]
*  Actual hijacking, drones, missile attacks on commercial [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  ships and all this is adding up now to a lot of ships rerouting, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=56.099999999999994s)]
*  taking longer to get where they're going to go, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=59.56s)]
*  skipping the Suez Canal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=61.36s)]
*  These attacks are taking a toll on the whole world because 90% [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=62.96s)]
*  of the world's commerce moves by ship, 10% through the Suez Canal [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=66.06s)]
*  every day. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=70.64s)]
*  Never mind things like oil and liquefied natural gas going [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=71.64s)]
*  through that passageway every second. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=74.68s)]
*  Today, oil and natural gas prices spiking after British [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=77.68s)]
*  petroleum said it would stop all shipments through the Red Sea [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=80.22s)]
*  because of these strikes. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to have much more on these attacks in just a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=84.72s)]
*  moment. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=87.26s)]
*  We're going to begin with Will Ripley because he is out front [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=88.26s)]
*  live in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=90.22s)]
*  And Will, today you were in southern Israel just a few miles [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=91.22s)]
*  from Gaza and what did you see? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=93.92s)]
*  You know, Erin, we were working most of the day within a stone's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=95.66000000000001s)]
*  throw of the fence that divides Israel and Gaza and you did not [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=100.02000000000001s)]
*  need a map to know when we were getting close to Gaza because [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  there was a massive smoke plume that was rising up from that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=106.38000000000001s)]
*  embattled area. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=109.94s)]
*  And in fact, every few minutes as we were driving and then even [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  louder on the ground, we heard very loud booms. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  We were just with the sound of outgoing Israeli artillery [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=117.28s)]
*  landing theoretically, presumably on the people of Gaza, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  which makes you wonder what the conditions must be like for them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=123.92s)]
*  there both above and even below ground. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=126.42s)]
*  Beneath the bombed out rubble of Gaza, a massive underground [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=131.66s)]
*  labyrinth, newly released videos from the Israeli military claim [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=135.6s)]
*  to show the biggest Hamas tunnel in Gaza, two and a half miles [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=139.3s)]
*  long, up to 164 feet deep with electricity, ventilation and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  communication systems. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  The IDF says the tunnel is wide enough for a large vehicle, even [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  a makeshift railroad. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=153.88000000000002s)]
*  CNN cannot independently verify these videos, claiming to show [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  what the IDF calls Hamas's strategic infrastructure, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=160.38000000000002s)]
*  hundreds of terror tunnel shafts throughout the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=164.12s)]
*  The IDF on a mission to locate and destroy dozens of attack [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=167.86s)]
*  tunnel routes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=172.0s)]
*  Hamas made the unverified claim of building more than 300 miles [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=173.18s)]
*  of tunnels under Gaza, tunnels for smuggling goods, launching [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=177.72s)]
*  attacks, storing rockets and ammunition. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=182.12s)]
*  And Israel says Hamas command centers hidden beneath homes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=185.56s)]
*  Under this child's car, not the baby's car. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=190.0s)]
*  He's in a tunnel that was used for terror by come up for three [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=193.84s)]
*  Israeli men held hostage in Gaza, a sign of desperation to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=196.6s)]
*  end a white sheet and a plea for help scrawled in Hebrew with [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  leftover food. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=205.62s)]
*  It reads help three hostages, a message either missed or ignored [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=207.56s)]
*  by Israeli soldiers who shot them down from a distance. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=212.56s)]
*  All three shirtless waving a white cloth. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  The men hold up in a building in the embattled Shijia neighborhood [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=219.24s)]
*  of Gaza City. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=222.74s)]
*  It's not clear if the hostages were abandoned or managed to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=224.88000000000002s)]
*  escape before the fatal confrontation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  The IDF admits the killings broke their rules of engagement, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=230.8s)]
*  adding pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=234.54s)]
*  secure the release of around 129 remaining hostages amid [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=238.18s)]
*  growing international calls for a ceasefire. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  A truce Israel says would only strengthen Hamas. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=246.08s)]
*  As everyday people suffer on the streets of Gaza, social media [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=251.52s)]
*  images show crowds climbing on aid trucks, a sign of growing [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=255.66s)]
*  desperation amid a mounting humanitarian crisis as the number [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=259.76s)]
*  of dead in Gaza approaches a staggering new milestone of 20,000. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=264.44s)]
*  That number just gives you chills and yet that is the reality in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=272.64s)]
*  Gaza right now and also the reality. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=276.62s)]
*  These new serious questions, Aaron, about how the IDF is [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=279.22s)]
*  operating on the ground. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=282.82s)]
*  The fact that these three Israeli hostages came out shirtless [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=283.82s)]
*  waving a white cloth, two of them were shot instantly, but yet [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=287.12s)]
*  the third who went back sought shelter, then came out again [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=290.56s)]
*  waving a white cloth and was shot and killed before the forces [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  realized that he was in fact Israeli. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=297.24s)]
*  You wonder what is happening to the countless civilians who are [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=299.28s)]
*  dying in Gaza, some of them face to face with the Israeli forces [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=302.6s)]
*  that are on the ground there, Aaron. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=305.74s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=307.08s)]
*  All right. Thank you very much. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  Will Ripley in Tel Aviv. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  Out front now, Daphne Richmond-Baroque. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=310.04s)]
*  She's an expert on Hamas tunnels and the author of Underground [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  Warfare, also an assistant professor at Israel's Raishman [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  University. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=318.44s)]
*  And I really appreciate your taking the time, Professor. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=319.44s)]
*  So when you look at the passageways of the tunnels, now [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=322.44s)]
*  we're looking at them much wider than the tunnels we've seen [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  before. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=328.42s)]
*  You can see a lot of people walking through together as [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=329.42s)]
*  opposed to that very narrow pathway of the other images that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=331.42s)]
*  we've seen, even wide enough for vehicles, even the large [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  IDFs have even wide enough for a railroad, electricity, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=338.06s)]
*  ventilation, communication, all of this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=341.36s)]
*  I mean, you spent a decade of your life studying tunnels like [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=343.36s)]
*  this, this entire system. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=347.5s)]
*  What do you see here? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=349.5s)]
*  I see a tunnel that looks a whole lot like the tunnels that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=351.5s)]
*  North Korea has dug into South Korea. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=357.5s)]
*  This is what I see. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=361.5s)]
*  I see something of a much higher level of energy than what we [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=362.5s)]
*  see here, a much higher level of sophistication, which you [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  describe much wider, more resistant, stronger, dug not [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  just by hand, but actually with the use of some sophisticated [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=375.92s)]
*  civilian boring equipment. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=381.92s)]
*  So we're talking about tunnel warfare on a different level. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=383.92s)]
*  And I see also in addition to the influence of North Korea, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=387.92s)]
*  kind of like the large tunnel, enabling a massive invasion and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=391.92s)]
*  infiltration into the country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=396.4s)]
*  I also see the hand of Iran here, which is a country that has [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=398.4s)]
*  deeply buried facilities. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=403.4s)]
*  So it is very different from what Hamas has done with its [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=405.4s)]
*  underground tunnel network. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=407.4s)]
*  But you can see that with Iran's help, Hamas has been able to dig [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=409.4s)]
*  deeper and better. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=414.42s)]
*  So, you know, you talk about the equipment, heavy boring [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=416.42s)]
*  equipment that would have been used. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=420.42s)]
*  I know the IDF has shown what they say are some images of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=422.42s)]
*  destruction on this tunnel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=424.90000000000003s)]
*  This tunnel, though, where it's located, we understand, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  according to the IDF, it ends just about a thousand feet [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  before, from the Israeli border, a specific crossing actually, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=434.90000000000003s)]
*  the Erez crossing on the northern Israeli Gaza border. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=438.90000000000003s)]
*  So when you take into account what the tunnel is, when you [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  talk about possibly being used for a large scale invasion, and [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  where you see it, then what does that layer of context tell you? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=454.90000000000003s)]
*  I think you put it very well. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=456.90000000000003s)]
*  It raises a lot of questions. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=458.90000000000003s)]
*  The first thing that I can tell you is I am pretty sure that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  this is not the only tunnel of the like that Hamas has. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  Not all Hamas tunnels look like this one, but I presume that it [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  has a few, a dozen, I would say, of such kind of like more [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  heavy duty tunnels. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=474.90000000000003s)]
*  And now the next question that comes up is, okay, so what did [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=476.90000000000003s)]
*  Hamas really intend to do with this tunnel, right? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=480.90000000000003s)]
*  It's obviously a very important military asset that was well [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=483.38s)]
*  concealed and came very close to Israel's border. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=487.38s)]
*  So I see two options. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=489.38s)]
*  Number one, this is a tunnel that was actually used or some [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=491.38s)]
*  portion of it or some variation on this tunnel was used on [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=495.38s)]
*  October 7th itself to enable this massive infiltration of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=499.38s)]
*  over 3,000 Hamas fighters. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=504.38s)]
*  I mean, these are some of the numbers. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=506.38s)]
*  We don't know the exact number. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=508.38s)]
*  We know it's a very high number. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=510.38s)]
*  And for them to go on foot into Israel, I find it, I would find [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=512.86s)]
*  it very surprising that it didn't use any kind of cross [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=516.86s)]
*  border tunnel. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=518.86s)]
*  So maybe this was one of those. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=520.86s)]
*  But I think another order of questioning would come to say, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=522.86s)]
*  okay, if this wasn't used, then what was Hamas' plan? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=524.86s)]
*  Was it to use this tunnel and make it operational? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=528.86s)]
*  Because it's obviously quasi-operational right now and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=532.86s)]
*  make it usable during the war, during the operation to carry [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=534.86s)]
*  out another massive infiltration or more kidnappings and more [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=539.34s)]
*  killings, meaning it's either one of these two options. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=544.34s)]
*  Because of exactly what you said, the fact that it's coming [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=548.34s)]
*  so close to Israel's border, I see these two scenarios. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=552.34s)]
*  And I presume that Israel will uncover in the coming days [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=555.34s)]
*  more such tunnels. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37iDmx-Ylk&t=559.34s)]
