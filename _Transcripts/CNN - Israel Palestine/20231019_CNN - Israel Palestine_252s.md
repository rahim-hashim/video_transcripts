# Tensions rising among House Democrats over Gaza hospital explosion
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs)
*  Bubbling beneath the surface of the Democratic Party here in D.C. are some real resentments [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=0.0s)]
*  of fellow Democrats still blaming Israel for the hospital explosion, despite U.S. intelligence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=5.68s)]
*  classified and unclassified, suggesting that it was actually a misfired Palestinian rocket [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  that did that damage. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=16.12s)]
*  Pennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetterman wrote on ex-formerly known as Twitter, quote, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=17.6s)]
*  it's truly disturbing that members of Congress rushed to blame Israel for the hospital tragedy [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=21.72s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=25.68s)]
*  Now, we take the word of a group that just massacred innocent Israeli civilians over [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=26.68s)]
*  our key ally. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=30.44s)]
*  Innocent Israelis were the victims of a terrorist attack that resulted in the largest loss of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=31.84s)]
*  Jewish lives since the Holocaust. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=35.16s)]
*  Now we know that the tragedy at the Gaza hospital was not caused by Israel, unquote. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=37.8s)]
*  Congressman Jared Moskowitz, Democrat of Florida, wrote, quote, my Democratic colleagues who [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=42.68s)]
*  blamed Israel should take down their posts, unquote. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=45.92s)]
*  Now one of the Congresswomen Moskowitz is referring to updated her post, noting that, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  the other Congresswoman Moskowitz, who wrote the U.S. intelligence assessment, is that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=53.36s)]
*  this was not done by Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=55.6s)]
*  But the other, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, not only has she not updated her [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=58.2s)]
*  post, she took the stage to address protesters calling for a ceasefire in Washington, D.C., [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=62.6s)]
*  last night and issued a political threat to the president of the United States. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=67.6s)]
*  President Biden, not all of America is with you on this one. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=71.6s)]
*  And you need to wake up and understand that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=74.6s)]
*  We are literally speaking to you on this one. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=75.6s)]
*  People, commit to genocide. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=76.66s)]
*  And killing, a vast majority just like this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  And we still stand by and say nothing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  We will remember this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=94.6s)]
*  And the congressman's tweet blaming Israel for what happened is still up. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=95.6s)]
*  Christine and Jessica Dean joins me now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=99.24s)]
*  So Jessica, Democrats have been very eager to highlight the embarrassing dysfunction [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=101.08s)]
*  of House Republicans when it comes to the speaker crisis. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=106.1s)]
*  But these are some tensions that we're seeing [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=108.94s)]
*  among House Democrats on this issue of Israel [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=112.66s)]
*  and the Palestinians as well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=117.16s)]
*  Yeah, you're seeing those fault lines. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=118.61999999999999s)]
*  And I talked to several House Democrats today [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=119.58s)]
*  and one of them told me in their words [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=121.82s)]
*  that her colleagues are furious. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=124.3s)]
*  So, leave colleagues? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=126.41999999999999s)]
*  Yes, that they're very frustrated [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  that it's not just public perception over this [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=130.06s)]
*  that they think that these sorts of comments [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=132.14s)]
*  that go against US intelligence are dangerous in a way [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=135.06s)]
*  by spreading that message. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  And they put it to me this way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=140.74s)]
*  They said, why is she believing Hamas's word [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=142.62s)]
*  over the US intelligence agencies? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=146.22s)]
*  And there is, I'm told, a push for her [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=148.46s)]
*  to sit for an intelligence briefing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=150.86s)]
*  and see the intelligence herself [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=152.54s)]
*  with the hope that that will inform [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  some messaging going forward. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=157.1s)]
*  I did ask if she has done that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=158.66s)]
*  or if she had plans to do that to her office. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=160.06s)]
*  I've not gotten a response from them. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=161.78s)]
*  We also know that some of her colleagues [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=163.3s)]
*  have complained to the Democratic leader in the House, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  Ekeem Jeffries, about this. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  I talked to another House Democrat that said, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=169.98000000000002s)]
*  they've really seen the House Democrats [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=173.26000000000002s)]
*  range from being outspoken on this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=175.74s)]
*  Debbie Wasserman-Schultz told my colleague, Annie Greer, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  that this is a vile position for the Congresswoman to take. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=179.58s)]
*  Others are kind of trying to like stand back, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=182.94s)]
*  give her some room to perhaps walk this back. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=185.06s)]
*  That it kind of ranges. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=188.18s)]
*  But they said that that Fetterman tweet [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=189.06s)]
*  that you just read in the lead in there, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=191.02s)]
*  that that sums up how a lot of House Democrats feel right now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=192.98s)]
*  So I talked to a U.S. Senator [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=195.54s)]
*  who attended a classified briefing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=197.01999999999998s)]
*  and said that the intelligence, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=198.34s)]
*  the classified intelligence makes it clear. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=199.98s)]
*  There's no doubt that this was Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=201.98s)]
*  It's very, very clear. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=205.01999999999998s)]
*  But are Democrats afraid that if they call out [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=206.66s)]
*  Congresswoman Tlaib that they will alienate [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=210.66s)]
*  and anger the progressive base of the Democratic Party [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=213.66s)]
*  that is far more critical of Israel? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=217.5s)]
*  Far more critical of Israel [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=219.26s)]
*  and has been part of the Democratic coalition [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=220.42s)]
*  in winning these elections in the last several cycles, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=222.7s)]
*  So they have been a critical part to the Democratic coalition. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=225.17999999999998s)]
*  The sense that I'm getting from talking to people is they, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  there is frustration, though, bubbling. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=231.89999999999998s)]
*  And what I'm interested to see is over the next day or two, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=233.78s)]
*  if this continues, if she continues to hold on to this, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  if people start to be more outspoken, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=239.7s)]
*  if we hear from more of her colleagues on the record [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  in a more outspoken way on this. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  Very interesting, Jessica Dean. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=247.54s)]
*  Thank you so much. Coming up next, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=249.06s)]
*  a huge development in that Georgia election. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBe2XYJZMs&t=250.17999999999998s)]
