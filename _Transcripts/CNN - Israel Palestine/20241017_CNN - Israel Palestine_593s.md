# Israeli military confirms killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA)
*  This is CNN Breaking News. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=0.0s)]
*  We begin this afternoon with breaking news. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=5.0s)]
*  Moments ago Israel confirming that the leader of Hamas and October 7th mastermind, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=8.0s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar, is dead. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=13.0s)]
*  We have CNN's Jeremy Diamond and Alex Moorport with the latest. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=16.0s)]
*  Let's first go to Jeremy in Jerusalem for us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=19.0s)]
*  Tell us what you know about the confirmation, Jeremy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=21.0s)]
*  Well Boris, this is an earth-shattering announcement from the Israeli military [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=26.0s)]
*  confirming that Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader, the mastermind of the October 7th attacks, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=30.0s)]
*  has indeed been killed by the Israeli military in Gaza. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=36.0s)]
*  His body has now been brought back to Israel and the DNA testing confirming, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=40.0s)]
*  beyond the shadow of a doubt, that it was indeed Sinwar. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=46.0s)]
*  The Israeli military is also providing new details about how and when he was killed, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=50.0s)]
*  saying that he was actually killed yesterday during military operations in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=55.0s)]
*  And we have learned, of course, from our sources as well, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=61.0s)]
*  that this was not an intelligence-driven special operation that resulted in Sinwar being killed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=64.0s)]
*  Instead, it appears that infantry soldiers came upon a group of three militants in Gaza [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=70.0s)]
*  and fired a tank shell at them. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=77.0s)]
*  And ultimately when they went and found the bodies in the rubble, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=80.0s)]
*  they realized that one of them resembled Yahya Sinwar. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=84.0s)]
*  That then triggered a set of alarm bells in senior ranks of the Israeli military and the Israeli government, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=87.0s)]
*  and ultimately triggering the confirmation that it was indeed him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=93.0s)]
*  There was initially confirmation via dental records, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=97.0s)]
*  and that was followed up by multiple DNA tests that ultimately gave the Israeli government and its military [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=100.0s)]
*  the confirmation to a confidence level necessary to be able to now announce this publicly. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=107.0s)]
*  They are also saying that it was soldiers in Israel's 828th Brigade, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=113.0s)]
*  that is an infantry brigade responsible actually for training other infantry soldiers [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=118.0s)]
*  that was operating in Gaza that successfully killed Sinwar. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=123.0s)]
*  We are already seeing in Gaza a mixed reaction from the population there, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=128.0s)]
*  some expressing sadness and shock at his death, but others very much celebrating it [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=134.0s)]
*  and hoping that Sinwar's death will accelerate the end of the war in Gaza. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=140.0s)]
*  And that is indeed now the question, whether or not Sinwar's killing gives the Israeli Prime Minister [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=145.0s)]
*  the opportunity to present a picture of victory in Israel, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=151.0s)]
*  to be able to move towards ending the war and perhaps even reaching a deal to free the hostages as well. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=155.0s)]
*  But so much uncertainty about who might succeed Yahya Sinwar at this point, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=162.0s)]
*  whether or not there is an immediate successor or whether instead we will see chaos in Hamas's ranks. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=167.0s)]
*  But without a doubt, this is an enormous moment in this region. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=174.0s)]
*  Just over a year after Sinwar launched this October 7th attack that then triggered this deadly, deadly war in Gaza, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=178.0s)]
*  the Israeli military now confirming that Yahya Sinwar has been killed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=185.0s)]
*  Jeremy, thank you. And we should say that CNN has now obtained, and I do want to warn our viewers, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=190.0s)]
*  this is a graphic image just so you have a chance to turn away if you need to here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=195.0s)]
*  CNN has obtained a verified picture of Sinwar's body. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=200.0s)]
*  You can see the face there blurred out, which certainly does spare some of the graphic nature, I will say, of this photo. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=206.0s)]
*  But this is a picture of that rubble that Jeremy was describing where the infantry fired a shell at this building. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=215.0s)]
*  And in this collapse found bodies of militants, including one that resembled Sinwar and was later verified to be Sinwar. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=224.0s)]
*  Alex Marquardt, bringing you into this. Tell us more about Sinwar, who has not been seen since the war began. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=233.0s)]
*  More than a year ago, was thought to have been constantly on the move. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=240.0s)]
*  I just think it's remarkable how this all unfolded. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=243.0s)]
*  We've seen these huge operations to go after other Hamas leaders or to try to rescue Israeli hostages. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=246.0s)]
*  This seemed like it was luck that they stumbled across Sinwar, not in a tunnel, not surrounded by hostages as we thought he was, according to U.S. intelligence officials. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=252.0s)]
*  He was out in the open with only two others. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=264.0s)]
*  We believe that photo is remarkable and it really speaks to how this unfolded in that they didn't know immediately that this was Yaya Sinwar. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=267.0s)]
*  So from what we understand, they fired that tank shell into the building. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=276.0s)]
*  But it was only today with a drone that they started getting indications that this could be him and went in to look and then were able to confirm through DNA testing that this was indeed him. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=280.0s)]
*  I've seen that image and other images. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=293.0s)]
*  I can tell you that while they're very, very gory, it was immediately apparent that this was very, very likely Sinwar. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=296.0s)]
*  You could tell that he had a strong resemblance to all the photos that we have seen with Sinwar. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=306.0s)]
*  But again, just remarkable to see that this unfolded. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=310.0s)]
*  We believe in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, and that was the belief that he was in or around Hanunis, where he's from, in a tunnel, possibly surrounded by hostages. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=314.0s)]
*  He may have been farther south than that, and he was moving around with a relatively light footprint. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=324.0s)]
*  He had been moving with just two other people. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=331.0s)]
*  He wouldn't have there wouldn't have been a lot of attention. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=334.0s)]
*  It would have been far less easy to spot. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=338.0s)]
*  But the U.S. has been helping with the intelligence to try to hunt him down, to try to find him. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=341.0s)]
*  And he has been very, very careful. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=347.0s)]
*  It's believed that he was not using electronic devices. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=349.0s)]
*  It's believed that he was spending most of his time underground. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=352.0s)]
*  And what appears to have happened now is that the Israeli military came upon him and managed to eliminate the most wanted man that Israel has been chasing for the past year, potentially with huge ramifications for this conflict. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=355.0s)]
*  Alex, Jeremy, please stand by. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=368.0s)]
*  We should let you know that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin and Yahoo is set to speak in just moments. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=370.0s)]
*  This as demonstrators are now, we understand, at hostage square in Tel Aviv, demonstrating and reacting to this news will, of course, bring you Netanyahu's remarks as they happen. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=375.0s)]
*  I want to expand the conversation now with retired naval commander Kirk Lippold. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=387.0s)]
*  Also with us is Barack Ravid. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=391.0s)]
*  He's a CNN political and global affairs analyst. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=393.0s)]
*  Barack, first to you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=396.0s)]
*  What are you learning about the process of confirming Sinwar's death and how he was killed? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=397.0s)]
*  Well, the process was made by both the Israeli police, their forensics team and, you know, pathologists who examined Sinwar's body. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=403.0s)]
*  And there were three different tests. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=421.0s)]
*  One was to examine his photographs of Sinwar's teeth, then a fingerprint test and then a DNA test. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=423.0s)]
*  And just minutes ago, all three were confirmed. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=433.0s)]
*  And the Israelis announced that it was indeed Sinwar. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=437.0s)]
*  And Commander, we've been talking about what this means then. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=440.0s)]
*  According to our reporting, U.S. officials have long looked at Sinwar's death as one of the best chances of this war coming to an end. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=445.0s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=452.0s)]
*  I think it's great news. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=455.0s)]
*  Number one, I would say that timing in life is everything, which in reality, when you look at you've got a training battalion versus frontline special operators. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=456.0s)]
*  And yet the training battalion is the one that caught him in the open and killed him really speaks to the readiness across the entire Israeli Defense Force, which means they are prepared. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=465.0s)]
*  They are at war and they're ready to react on a moment's notice to hunt down and kill these terrorists no matter where they are from the top level leadership like Sinwar down to the regular foot soldiers that continue to this fight. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=475.0s)]
*  I think the next step you're going to see happen is this is where the Israeli intelligence is really going to kick in, because what you're going to see is not only did they catch him out in the open, but then the real question is where did he come from and where was he headed to that he would have such a light footprint out in the open trying to avoid things when in fact everything we have learned would indicate that he had surrounded himself by those hostages as a kind of human shield and protection. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=489.0s)]
*  That's not there. So now we have to look beyond the immediate death of Sinwar. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=518.0s)]
*  Those are all good questions. I do wonder Barack internally from the Israeli perspective. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=522.0s)]
*  And clearly U.S. officials maybe I'd say a little bit hopefully looking at this as an opportunity. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=528.0s)]
*  Is that how it's viewed internally in Israel that this could lead to a better chance at a hostage ceasefire deal? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=537.0s)]
*  Definitely. And what I hear from Prime Minister Netanyahu's closest aides is that they say that now a window of opportunity is open for either getting more hostages out in the military operation because Hamas is in disarray or now using this blow that Hamas suffered to get the hostage deal that has been sort of in the freezer. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=545.0s)]
*  For the last two months. And one of Netanyahu's aides told me that the Prime Minister's main focus right now is hostages, hostages, hostages. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=574.0s)]
*  And he's going to try and push for some sort of both deal or military operation to get them out. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdJe11ECNQA&t=584.0s)]
