# 'It was like that place didn't exist': See doctors' journey leaving Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY)
*  This is what leaving Gaza looks like. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=0.0s)]
*  Driving through the dust and debris, 16 healthcare workers finally evacuating the Gaza European [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Hospital. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  A journey many outside Gaza haven't seen, and most inside are unable to make. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Among them, Dr. Adam Hammowy, a U.S. combat surgeon and humanitarian first responder. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=19.88s)]
*  He recently chose to stay behind when an initial evacuation was only offered to U.S. citizens. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=26.48s)]
*  These are the conditions Hammowy and his colleagues worked under. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=37.52s)]
*  He wrote a letter to President Biden saying he had never witnessed quote, the level of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=45.32s)]
*  atrocities and targeting of medical colleagues as he had in Gaza, urging the president to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  allow a humanitarian corridor to be established and for his colleagues and himself to be allowed [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=55.3s)]
*  to evacuate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=60.94s)]
*  Days later, the team were on their way. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=62.419999999999995s)]
*  Our farewell was marked with many tears on both sides. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=65.06s)]
*  We gave them everything we had. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=67.89999999999999s)]
*  We left really with the clothes we were wearing in a small backpack each. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=70.46s)]
*  But even then they were giving us little gifts to remember them by and with promises that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=75.7s)]
*  we will come back and we will continue to help them and we won't forget. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  You do want to go back, right? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=87.62s)]
*  All of us want to go back. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=90.18s)]
*  There are people who are not able to leave, like the Palestinians themselves, and we can't [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=91.62s)]
*  forget them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  And while getting permission was one thing, making the treacherous journey was another. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=102.06s)]
*  It was very dystopian the way it happened. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  Everything was through instructions by phone with very choppy service. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=110.54s)]
*  Okay, so green light to go around all the trucks. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=116.5s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=120.26s)]
*  There. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=121.26s)]
*  Everything, I believe, was observed through the overhead drones. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=122.26s)]
*  It took us about three hours to do that 15-minute drive that normally takes to get to work. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=129.26s)]
*  It was a level of destruction I had not seen before. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=139.26s)]
*  It was, there was nothing left standing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  The unusual part was that crossing, which was really, like I said, it was like out of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=145.54s)]
*  a science fiction movie. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=149.66s)]
*  Once you left the gate and when we were driving through Israel, it was like, it was a completely [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=152.06s)]
*  another world. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=156.73999999999998s)]
*  It was, I went from what I just described to driving through California. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=157.73999999999998s)]
*  It was like that place didn't exist. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6s5C5GhnAY&t=162.98s)]
