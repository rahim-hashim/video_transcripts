# Man with loved ones in Gaza shares heartbreaking reality behind family photo
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8)
*  As calls for a ceasefire grow inside the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=0.0s)]
*  tonight Israel has agreed to four-hour pauses each day [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=3.0s)]
*  to allow aid to get in to Gaza and for civilians to get out. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=6.84s)]
*  But a senior Israeli official says that this will only apply [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=11.08s)]
*  to specific neighborhoods in the war zone. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=14.68s)]
*  Some Democrats, though, say that this is not enough. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=17.36s)]
*  My next guest knows firsthand just how devastating [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=20.48s)]
*  this violence has been for families still inside of Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=23.88s)]
*  Sami Shaban is a Palestinian American. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=28.24s)]
*  He has lost 17 family members since this war began. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=30.52s)]
*  That loss amounts to four generations now gone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=35.04s)]
*  Sami, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=39.68s)]
*  And I'm so sorry for what is really a profound loss [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=41.76s)]
*  for your family. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=46.16s)]
*  We were just speaking. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=48.72s)]
*  11 of the 17 members basically lost in one incident. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=49.64s)]
*  Tell us about what happened to them. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=55.64s)]
*  They were lost, but they were specifically killed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=58.12s)]
*  I mean, that's the word. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=60.44s)]
*  A bomb dropped on them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=61.48s)]
*  It was ironic because my cousin Abdullah's house, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=64.32s)]
*  who lives there, told my uncle, it's safer where I am. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=66.88s)]
*  They're bombing over there. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Come to my house. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=71.72s)]
*  He went there and they were bombed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=72.52s)]
*  Nine of them were killed then. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=74.68s)]
*  Two survivors were my uncle and my cousin. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=76.72s)]
*  She survived only for a few days going through surgeries [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=79.96s)]
*  where there's no anesthesia. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=83.68s)]
*  They cut directly into you in the hospital. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  My uncle survived for 10 days, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=88.28s)]
*  but he eventually succumbed to his wounds. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=89.84s)]
*  He was burned from the head to toe. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=92.08s)]
*  And he was one of the best of us. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=95.08s)]
*  He was a person that from the time he was young [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=97.84s)]
*  was just a beautiful person. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=101.68s)]
*  He would line up for prayer. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=103.92s)]
*  He would always be trying to guide towards good. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=105.8s)]
*  He was always somebody that people looked up to. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=107.84s)]
*  And so to have that loss, for me, it breaks my heart [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=110.4s)]
*  that I'll never be able to see him again. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  You also have a lot of family members [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=115.56s)]
*  who are still in Gaza. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=117.16s)]
*  I do. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=118.64s)]
*  What are you hearing from them? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=119.48s)]
*  What are their lives like right now? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=121.16s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=123.04s)]
*  I mean, they see the water tanks have been attacked. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=123.88s)]
*  The bakeries have been attacked. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=128.04s)]
*  There's no access to basic necessities. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  My aunt, who's dependent on life-saving drugs, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=131.36s)]
*  is running out of those medicines as we speak. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=134.68s)]
*  My uncle, who requires oxygen tanks, is running out of that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=137.48s)]
*  When they are surrounded, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=142.48s)]
*  it took four days for my uncle's family to be excavated. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=144.2s)]
*  And when they finally did take them out of that rubble, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=147.32s)]
*  they could only pull them out in small burnt chunks. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  Indistinguishable. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  They couldn't tell who was who, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  especially the children. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=156.44s)]
*  They had to lump them together. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=157.44s)]
*  How many children were there? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=159.44s)]
*  There was four children. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=160.79999999999998s)]
*  One of them wasn't even a year old. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  I have a picture that I shared with you all. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=165.84s)]
*  In that one picture at a wedding, they all look so happy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=167.76s)]
*  Not one of them is alive right now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=170.52s)]
*  You have a cousin, my understanding, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  who is or was pregnant. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=174.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=176.12s)]
*  How is she? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=176.96s)]
*  I mean, she's surviving. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  She was pregnant. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=179.32000000000002s)]
*  She went to the hospital. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  They refused her at the hospital. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  She ended up having to have a cesarean section, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=182.28s)]
*  which as any mother will tell you, is a very, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=184.8s)]
*  I mean, when my wife had it, there's a million doctors. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  There's all these, she had nothing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=189.84s)]
*  She went to a small room. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=192.36s)]
*  They did the surgery. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  They had to have her out within 10 hours of that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  And now she's had to move several times within Gaza [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=198.28s)]
*  just to be able to survive with these wounds. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  Shortly after having a baby, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=203.8s)]
*  what is your reaction to this news [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=206.08s)]
*  that there are gonna be these four hour windows each day [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=208.88000000000002s)]
*  to allow civilians to move around within Gaza [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=211.52s)]
*  from the Israeli government? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  As a Palestinian, I welcome it because that's my family, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=218.4s)]
*  but it's not enough. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=221.74s)]
*  More needs to be done. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=222.72000000000003s)]
*  There needs to be a ceasefire. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=224.0s)]
*  There needs to be an end to the blockade of humanitarian aid. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=225.4s)]
*  These people are dying. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=228.8s)]
*  They are running out of food. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=229.82s)]
*  My cousins are telling me there's literally no water [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=230.84s)]
*  or food for them to eat or drink. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  We need to open this up. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  These kids have done nothing wrong. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=236.46s)]
*  4,000 children have been killed at this point. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=238.68s)]
*  4,000, that's more than 9-11. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=241.52s)]
*  This is a humanitarian crisis at epic levels. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=244.4s)]
*  We need to stop, and it's our government [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=248.36s)]
*  that is partially responsible, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  and we need to be able to stand up, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=251.72s)]
*  have the bravery to stand up to anybody in the world [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=253.16s)]
*  and say, you need to stop. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=256.32s)]
*  You need to stop this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=257.76s)]
*  There are better ways to do this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=258.88s)]
*  If there was a mass shooter huddled in a school, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=260.52s)]
*  you wouldn't blow up the whole school, right? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=264.6s)]
*  You need to be technical about how you're gonna go after this [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=266.72s)]
*  because in the meanwhile, my family members, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=270.12s)]
*  the innocent people there are being killed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=272.12s)]
*  They're being slaughtered. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=274.4s)]
*  This is turning into a genocide. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=275.36s)]
*  We need to stop it now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=277.2s)]
*  Sami, Shaban, I appreciate you sharing your perspective, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  and again, I'm incredibly sorry. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=282.44s)]
*  This is, as I said earlier, it's a profound loss, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=284.84s)]
*  that number of people from your single family. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=287.96s)]
*  Thank you again for joining us and sharing that with me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=290.32s)]
*  Thank you, Abby. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejbl4AKhlj8&t=292.6s)]
