*  This is an RPG homemade by Hamas RPG 7 VR. This is homemade you can see the symbol [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's written kataibel Kasam, which means the troops of Azadin and Kasam. Kasam Brigades? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=7.76s)]
*  Yeah, Kasam Brigades. You have the engine of RPG 7 and the warheads of RPG 29 [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=13.6s)]
*  This is homemade in their factories in Hamas factories. In Gaza? In Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=20.92s)]
*  But these, everything here came from the attacks? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=26.72s)]
*  Yeah, this is all this was found inside our villages and bases inside Israel [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=31.16s)]
*  We found this in private houses in vehicles [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  We found IEDs attached to private vehicles to tanks inside our bases all around the Gaza border [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=42.64s)]
*  And grenades? Yeah, this is grenades. Also you can see the Islamic year over here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=50.56s)]
*  Yep, 1437, kataibel Kasam. Again, Kasam Brigades. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  And these, some of these, all of these, I know were thrown into? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=69.76s)]
*  Into houses. You can see houses with fragmentation, chaos. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=76.52s)]
*  You can see... [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=81.64s)]
*  And in shelters where people had gathered some of these? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=82.64s)]
*  Yeah, in some of the shelters when they managed to open only one window, they just threw grenades inside [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=85.12s)]
*  It was still striking to see the weapons, right? To see just the amount of the arsenal and to learn about where and when they came from [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=92.56s)]
*  You know, some dated back to the Soviet Union, but others recently from Iran [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=99.52s)]
*  You can see here claymores, which is anti-person IED [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=106.04s)]
*  Shape-charge IED against tanks, landmines [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=112.56s)]
*  Are these anti-tank? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=119.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is anti-tank landmines, which calls TC6 [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=120.4s)]
*  Some of this comes from other places? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=125.28s)]
*  Those RPGs are very old from the Soviet Union, like years ago [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=127.76s)]
*  But most of the stuff came from Gaza Strip factories [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGFzeKG3_r4&t=132.76s)]
