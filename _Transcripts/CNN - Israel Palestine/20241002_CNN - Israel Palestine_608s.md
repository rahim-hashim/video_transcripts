# Israel and Hezbollah clash on the ground in southern Lebanon
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k)
*  We begin with breaking news out of the Middle East. Israel has just announced that seven more of its soldiers have been killed in ground operations in southern Lebanon, bringing the total number to eight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=0.0s)]
*  CNN Chief National Security Analyst Jim Cheado is in Tel Aviv and Jim, this comes as Israel is sending thousands more troops to take part in a ground fight in Lebanon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=12.96s)]
*  This is a significant loss for the Israeli military. Just in the first couple of days of this ground incursion into southern Lebanon, which we should note, it's the first time in 18 years, you have to go back to the 2006 war, for when Israel last sent significant numbers of ground forces into southern Lebanon. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=21.48s)]
*  And to have this death toll this early in those operations is a measure of the danger, the danger on the ground there as Israel confronts Hezbollah, not just from the air, as we've seen with a significant number of airstrikes, but in ground combat. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=44.919999999999995s)]
*  This comes as Israel is considering retaliation for last night's unprecedented missile attack. Some 180 ballistic missiles fired here at Israel, the vast majority of them shot down, but some striking the ground, including around us here in central Tel Aviv last night. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=60.36s)]
*  Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Jared Mosquist of Florida. He serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman, thanks so much for taking the time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Jim. Thanks for having me. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=86.11999999999999s)]
*  First, I want to begin with this significant Israeli loss, our understanding this was in a firefight between an Israeli commando unit and presumably Hezbollah fighters on the other side of the border. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  This brings back echoes of the 2006 war when Israel suffered significant casualties with an uncertain outcome after the end of that war. It lasted about a month. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=103.0s)]
*  I wonder, in your view, does this human cost so early on signal that this operation might be more dangerous than some had imagined? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=113.0s)]
*  Well, no, I think the Israelis know that it's dangerous, but I think they understand that it's more dangerous to allow Iran proxies on your border. The appeasement of Iran and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, can no longer stand. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=123.88s)]
*  I think Iran is actually just yesterday in Tel Aviv with a terrorist attack that's killing people that were just on the high-speed rail. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=140.76s)]
*  And so this mission is going to be dangerous. It is limited in scope. It is trying to push Hezbollah back away from the border so that people in Israel can return to their homes. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=148.76s)]
*  Remember, Hezbollah has fired 9,000 rockets into northern Israel. 50,000-plus people have had to flee their homes there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=158.76s)]
*  It's trying to establish some sort of normal, to normalize the situation in the north so that people can return to their homes, but also to reestablish deterrence with Iran and its proxies. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=167.64s)]
*  I understand that I've spent a lot of time in northern Israel and talked to some of those families who have left. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=181.64s)]
*  But as you know, Israel's track record of attempting exactly the same is spotty at best. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=185.64s)]
*  I think the Lebanese military has been in control of southern Lebanon for 18 years, from 1982 to 2000, then again had the war in 2006, perhaps caused some damage, some losses for Hezbollah, but Hezbollah lived to survive another day. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=192.51999999999998s)]
*  And I just wonder, given the parallel efforts for some sort of negotiated agreement where perhaps the Lebanese military takes over control for southern Lebanon might be a more lasting path rather than military action alone. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm not against that. I think you're right. I think we'll have to get to a negotiated solution at some point. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=217.4s)]
*  But in the meantime, I think Israel wants to degrade the amount of weapons that are on their border. Tens of thousands of missiles and rockets. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=225.4s)]
*  Pretty advanced stuff, not like us. And Israel wants to go and degrade some of that capacity before we get to that situation. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=233.4s)]
*  No one's talking about occupying Lebanon, right? This is a limited mission, a limited incursion trying to restore some of the balance out there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=244.28s)]
*  But also, Jim, this is unprecedented territory. We had 180 ballistic missiles launched at Israel yesterday, the second time that has happened. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=252.28s)]
*  This is all connected. It's not happening in a vacuum, as you know. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's get more now from Nick Robertson, who's in Tel Aviv, and Arlette Sines, who's at the White House. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  Nick, let's start first with you. We're getting these numbers of eight soldiers, eight IDF soldiers killed in that fighting. Tell us more. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we know that some of them are from the Ghulani Brigade, which is one of the sort of elite, most battle-hardened, battle-trained units, the EGOZ unit and the Yatlam unit as well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not clear precisely where this took place, although we do understand a rough location of some clashes, at least along the border in the early hours of today. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=290.04s)]
*  Hezbollah says that they have struck IDF forces in three different areas, three different villages along the border. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=302.04s)]
*  The IDF has said that these were localized and targeted raids. In fact, the IDF releasing video of troops walking through the sort of rugged countryside, up hills, going into houses, searching houses. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=310.92s)]
*  But this is a very deadly day. A local hospital near that front line at the border had declared a mass casualty event a little earlier in the day. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=324.92s)]
*  They had received some of the casualties, but this number we're now hearing the IDF saying eight soldiers killed. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=339.8s)]
*  We also understand that many of these soldiers were captains, majors. They were of relatively senior rank. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=347.8s)]
*  Not uncommon for the IDF to have them in the front lines leading the fight, but a significant blow for experienced troops to be caught in this way. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=355.8s)]
*  This is a crucial political blow for the Prime Minister as well. This is not what he or the IDF would have hoped for on the second day only of operations, ground operations inside of Lebanon. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=368.68s)]
*  There's been so much talk about the lessons learned in 2006 of Israel's incursion during the 34-day war there of 1982 and Israel's troops on the ground inside Lebanon until the year 2000. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=380.68s)]
*  18 years they were there. Israel took high casualties when the troops were on the ground in Lebanon. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=395.56s)]
*  And this is going to be a bitter reminder of that as these troops just go across the border. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=399.56s)]
*  And of course Hezbollah has been aware for the potential for this military action targeting them. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=405.56s)]
*  This is what the IDF has been saying, targeting Hezbollah installations along the border. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=411.56s)]
*  And the expectation along the border, as we discovered when we talked to local people yesterday, is Hezbollah would have been planning for this and preparing for it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=415.56s)]
*  All right, Nick Robertson, thank you so much for that reporting. Let's go now to Arlette Saenz, who's at the White House. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=425.44s)]
*  And Arlette, we know that this administration, the Biden administration, is coordinating with Israel on whatever that response might be to Iran. What more are you learning? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=432.44s)]
*  Yeah, Jessica, senior U.S. officials continue to be in constant contact with their Israeli counterparts as they try to determine what the next steps in the Israelis' response to Iran will be. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=441.44s)]
*  Now, President Biden is expected today to convene a call with leaders of other G7 countries to specifically talk about the situation in the Middle East. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=455.32s)]
*  That's according to a source familiar with the call. And it comes at a time as the U.S. and other allies are waiting to see exactly how Israel might respond. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=464.32s)]
*  You have heard President Biden say that they support Israel and also want to keep these lines of communications open to try to determine these next steps. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=472.32s)]
*  But one question going forward is what U.S. assistance in any type of response might look like. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=483.2s)]
*  And you have heard publicly across the administration from here at the White House and at the State Department that the U.S. does believe there will be severe consequences for Iran following this attack. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=490.2s)]
*  Take a listen to what the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan had to say on that matter. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=501.2s)]
*  This is a significant escalation by Iran. We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=506.08s)]
*  Now, so far, a senior U.S. official tells CNN that the U.S. does not believe that Israel has made their final determination about how they will proceed. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=516.08s)]
*  There is a hope that there will be some consultation between the U.S. and Israel before they make any final decisions going forward. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=527.96s)]
*  President Biden has said that he does plan to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at some point. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=534.96s)]
*  It's unclear exactly when that might come. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=539.96s)]
*  But one big question is how much influence the U.S. will be able to have over this decision. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=542.96s)]
*  You'll remember back in April when Iran had launched that barrage of missiles and drones against Israel that were ultimately thwarted by the U.S. and other allies, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=549.84s)]
*  that at that time, President Biden had essentially told Netanyahu to take a win. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=556.84s)]
*  You only saw a very limited response from Israel in that moment. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=563.84s)]
*  Officials acknowledged that this situation is much different, so the administration is likely going to try to encourage the Israelis to take some type of measured response [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=567.84s)]
*  when they do in fact plan their response to Iran's attack. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=577.72s)]
*  Yesterday, the State Department would not say whether they believed Iran might target nuclear facilities in Iran. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=582.72s)]
*  They simply said they wouldn't comment on that matter. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=591.72s)]
*  They weren't ruling anything in or ruling anything out. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=594.72s)]
*  But it does present a very tricky dynamic for not just Israel but also the U.S. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=597.72s)]
*  as they're trying to prevent this from really escalating into all-out war in the Middle East. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XhUsX759k&t=602.72s)]
