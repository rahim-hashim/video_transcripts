*  New video of the Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel and some of the nearly 200 ballistic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=0.0s)]
*  missiles Iran used landing on it. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  This was the same base that Iran targeted back in April. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=16.64s)]
*  Unclear at this point, what, if anything, was hit this time? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=19.6s)]
*  Israeli defense forces say at least one person was killed during the attack and several were [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=23.84s)]
*  hurt. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=27.8s)]
*  The attack followed a series of Israeli operations against Iran's ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=28.88s)]
*  which decapitated in some cases almost literally the terror group's senior leadership, and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=33.84s)]
*  came just hours after Israeli forces went into southern Lebanon. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=40.2s)]
*  Today, all of that, quote, has been deleted. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=44.08s)]
*  Tonight, Iran again attacked Israel with hundreds of missiles. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=52.16s)]
*  This attack failed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=62.04s)]
*  It was thwarted thanks to Israel's air defense system, which is the most advanced in the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=63.76s)]
*  world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=68.0s)]
*  Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=69.88s)]
*  The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=73.28s)]
*  determination to retaliate against our enemies. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=78.11999999999999s)]
*  American military assets also took part in Israel's defense. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  The Navy has a carrier group in the Arabian Sea, including a number of destroyers capable [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=85.28s)]
*  of shooting down ballistic missiles. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=90.24s)]
*  The president and vice president spent part of the day in the White House Situation Room [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=92.39999999999999s)]
*  monitoring the strikes and hearing from their national security team. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=96.36s)]
*  Vice President Harris underscoring her support for the Jewish state. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=100.7s)]
*  As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=106.36s)]
*  and Iran-backed terrorist militias. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=111.92s)]
*  My commitment to the security of Israel is unwavering. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=115.0s)]
*  The former president also spoke to the crisis literally in apocalyptic terms. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=120.56s)]
*  Short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=127.32s)]
*  We it's just it's I've been talking about World War Three for a long time, and I don't [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=132.68s)]
*  want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=139.16s)]
*  We're not going to make, but they are very close to global catastrophe. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  Tonight, thankfully, the signs do not point quite that way, not catastrophic, but to be [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=147.16s)]
*  sure, a world away from calm. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=152.68s)]
*  We have correspondents tonight across the region and around the world, along with top [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=155.24s)]
*  diplomatic, military and political experts on the crisis. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=159.2s)]
*  Let's begin with CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who is in Ramat Hasharon, Israel, just north of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=163.0s)]
*  Tel Aviv. Jeremy, what can you tell us about the situation there behind you right now? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=168.42s)]
*  We should note it's three a.m. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=172.92s)]
*  Local time. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we are on the outskirts of Tel Aviv where at least two missiles made impact in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=178.28s)]
*  this area, two of those 180 Iranian ballistic missiles that were fired on Israel, sending [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=183.86s)]
*  millions of people fleeing into bomb shelters tonight. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=189.94000000000003s)]
*  You can see behind me some of the damage that was brought by at least one of those [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  explosions, piles of dirt piled on top of the vehicles here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=196.46s)]
*  This vehicle, its windshield and some of the passenger windows totally shattered by the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=201.5s)]
*  power of this blast. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=207.58s)]
*  And we are seeing all across Israel and several of the locations that were hit by these [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=209.58s)]
*  ballistic missiles, crews coming out to fill in the the craters that were left, crews [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=214.82s)]
*  coming to pick through some of the shrapnel to identify exactly the type of Iranian missiles [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=220.58s)]
*  that were fired here. We actually saw our team was able to geolocate video of at least [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  one of the missiles that hit this area. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=230.76s)]
*  And this area is significant. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=233.02s)]
*  Not only is it the outskirts of Tel Aviv, a major city in Israel, but also this is an [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=234.5s)]
*  area where there are two major Israeli military intelligence bases and military intelligence [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=240.1s)]
*  base and the headquarters of Israel's Mossad are in this area. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=245.86s)]
*  But clearly, these missiles did not hit what Israeli officials believe was their intended [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  target. We did also see video of missiles hitting the Nevatim airbase in southern [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=256.94s)]
*  Israel. Multiple explosions spotted there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=262.82s)]
*  The Israeli military said that several missiles did indeed hit in central and southern [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=265.7s)]
*  Israel. But they say that most of these Iranian missiles were indeed intercepted by [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=271.42s)]
*  Israel's air defense systems. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=276.1s)]
*  And thankfully, we know there are a few injuries that have been reported thus far and only [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  one fatality. Obviously, it could have been a lot worse given what we saw, the projectiles [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=282.74s)]
*  there coming in in the sky, one missile after another. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=288.21999999999997s)]
*  I know you also visited an elementary school was that was at the site of one of the blasts [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=291.18s)]
*  there south of Tel Aviv. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=296.5s)]
*  What did you see when you were there? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. We were in Gadara, which is in the southern part of central Israel, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=302.62s)]
*  and we visited a school there, an elementary school. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=306.9s)]
*  And one of these missiles appears to have made impact in the schoolyard of that of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=310.9s)]
*  that school. We've actually spoken to multiple [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=317.46s)]
*  military analysts who identified the pieces of shrapnel that we saw at the scene and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=320.7s)]
*  said that it does indeed appear to be the remnants of an Iranian ballistic missile. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=325.21999999999997s)]
*  And you can see the images from that scene. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=330.06s)]
*  A facade of the school has been partially destroyed by the blast caused by that missile, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=333.3s)]
*  glass shattered and a pretty significant crater lying right in front of what were [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=339.7s)]
*  second and third grade classrooms. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=345.18s)]
*  Just hours earlier, there were students who were in that school attending what would be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=347.98s)]
*  the last day of school before the high holidays of Rosh Hashanah. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=352.86s)]
*  Luckily, they were not there at the time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=356.86s)]
*  And as you said, only one man was killed in the West Bank, actually in the city of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=359.14000000000004s)]
*  Jericho. Two other Israelis were injured in the area of Tel Aviv. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=363.74s)]
*  As you said, Brianna, it could have been much, much worse. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=369.86s)]
*  But no doubt, Israeli public very much shaken up by the events. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, shaken up. And as you know, the holiday, the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah begins [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=377.66s)]
*  at sunset tonight in Israel. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=382.06s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, thank you so much. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=385.82s)]
*  CNN's Jim Schudo and his crew were almost in the line of fire as the missiles came in. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=387.38s)]
*  Here is what it looked like just before Jim and his team had to take cover. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=392.54s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=397.34s)]
*  OK, guys, we got to get off the roof. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=403.14s)]
*  These are coming down right next to us here. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=404.53999999999996s)]
*  Please do, Jim, please do. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=406.61999999999995s)]
*  Jim Schudo joins us now. Thankfully, you and your team are OK. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=409.7s)]
*  It was quite frightening to watch what you were there witnessing, Jim, and hearing the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=413.17999999999995s)]
*  sounds of the booms. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=418.53999999999996s)]
*  Many of those missiles were intercepted, though we knew some did make landfall there. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=420.41999999999996s)]
*  Talk to us about what you're hearing now from your sources in terms of any more anticipated [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=426.02s)]
*  strikes, perhaps from Iran, as we're now waiting for Israel to respond. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=431.94s)]
*  Not not from Iran. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=437.7s)]
*  It seems that Iran, with these two significant barrages, which we should note, this attack [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  twice as big as the already unprecedented one we saw in April, Iran signaling that was [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=445.5s)]
*  their attack for now and message delivered in effect. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=451.82000000000005s)]
*  So and the alert certainly has been removed here in Tel Aviv and around Israel. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=457.14000000000004s)]
*  No more air raid sirens. Folks folks allowed to go home and continue on, although, of course, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=463.06s)]
*  it's middle of the night now. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=468.34000000000003s)]
*  So the question now, really, the focus is on Israel's response. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=470.74s)]
*  And Israeli officials have been quite public, quite clear in public that they plan a response [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=474.34000000000003s)]
*  and possibly quite soon serious consequences, as Admiral Higare, the IDF spokesman, described it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=479.18s)]
*  So what are those serious consequences? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=485.94s)]
*  We don't know that the range of options are quite severe. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=487.97999999999996s)]
*  Iranian oil facilities, possibly even Iranian nuclear facilities, and each one of those [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=492.14s)]
*  has costs and each one of those likely to engender a response from Iran back to Israel. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=498.21999999999997s)]
*  Bianna, you've covered this conflict for so many years like me. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=505.14s)]
*  We've been caught in this vicious cycle before. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=508.9s)]
*  One side attacks, the other retaliates, might claim that it's a proportional retaliation, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=511.82s)]
*  but the other side might not interpret it that way and then retaliates on its own. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=517.7s)]
*  We're in quite a dangerous cycle here and one can only hope cooler heads prevail. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=522.14s)]
*  Yeah. And as the Pentagon noted, these strikes were meant to cause massive destruction, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=528.34s)]
*  as you just said, twice the number of ballistic missiles sent this time from Iran than they had sent over in April. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=532.78s)]
*  And in April, that was the first time Israel had directly stricken, Iran directly sent missiles towards Israel. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=540.5s)]
*  Now we're seeing this happen again in an unprecedented nature. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=548.42s)]
*  Just describe what the situation felt like in the country, Jim, where you had virtually the entire country, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=552.1s)]
*  nearly 10 million people for one solid hour sitting in their safe rooms. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=557.6999999999999s)]
*  This was a big attack, Bianna. I mean, the volume and the speed, two barrages of several minutes each, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=562.78s)]
*  separated by about 15 minutes, and we now know 180 missiles. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  So 90 missiles, perhaps a few more in a few minutes span, and many of them, not all of them directed on Tel Aviv, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=576.78s)]
*  but many of them directed on Tel Aviv, and we know that because you could see the missile intercepts. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=585.02s)]
*  You see the kind of slow rise of the intercept missile going into the sky. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=589.26s)]
*  And then we saw the impacts, several of them at first off in the distance and then more and more over our heads here. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=593.14s)]
*  And then we saw and felt impacts. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=598.86s)]
*  And it was hard to judge in those moments whether those were missiles getting through or whether they were pieces of missiles following an impact in the sky. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=602.58s)]
*  But a couple of them quite close to the hotel here, just to the north. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=610.78s)]
*  And then one that was quite large, a couple miles north of us, which I believe based on the location, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=614.3s)]
*  was the site where Jeremy was at the site of the Mossad headquarters here. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=620.66s)]
*  Casualties here inside Israel, though, of course, as you noted, there was one in the West Bank. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=633.66s)]
*  It really speaks to the success of Israel's air defense systems, right? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=639.78s)]
*  Iron Dome, David Sling, clearly coming into effect here in the United States, also intercepting some of these missiles. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=643.34s)]
*  Jim, stay safe. We'll check back in with you later. Thank you. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=651.38s)]
*  Let's go next to Haifa, northern Israel, CNN's Nick Robertson. Nick, you spent the day on the border with Lebanon. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=655.46s)]
*  And just given the fast pace of these developments, it's easy to forget that that's where the focus was this morning. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=661.46s)]
*  These precise small scale incursions that Israel was starting to make into southern Lebanon. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=668.74s)]
*  What is the situation there now? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=674.78s)]
*  Yeah, we were right up along the border. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=678.9s)]
*  We went into the house in one tiny village, talked to a lady there who literally her patio looks out at the border. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=681.54s)]
*  She pointed out two villages she can see inside of Lebanon. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=688.98s)]
*  And just as we were standing there, there was a huge crash and boom. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=692.54s)]
*  It wasn't quite clear what it was. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=697.1s)]
*  She didn't flinch because she's been there since October the 8th, but everyone else in her village has evacuated. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=698.94s)]
*  And I asked her, what does she think about the fact that the troops were going over the border? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  She said she was happy about that, that she thought ultimately it would make them safer at the border. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=710.34s)]
*  But she also said she was worried for the soldiers because there's a potential for booby traps, a potential for mines. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=715.82s)]
*  So she was concerned because she recognized that troops going across the border is different than airstrikes and less safe for them. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=723.38s)]
*  And while we were there, I actually did talk to a couple of soldiers there about the threat at that time. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  It was before Iran strikes, the threat at that time of Iran possibly striking Israel. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=739.3s)]
*  And they said, bring it on. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=744.9s)]
*  And I think that reflects the sentiment of certainly those in the military here and reflected in the results of the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=747.1s)]
*  ability to thwart and blunt the vast majority of the potential impact that they feel relatively confident about taking on this threat at this particular time. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=753.42s)]
*  And I think that speaks volumes about what a response from Israel might look like and the preparedness of the forces here to to deliver that at the moment. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=764.98s)]
*  Yeah, because the Israeli government recently expanded its war aims and goals, and that included the return of the tens of thousands, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=777.4200000000001s)]
*  more than 60,000 residents to their home there in the north. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=784.1800000000001s)]
*  A reminder that on October 8th, just the day after the October 7th attack, Hezbollah started launching rockets into Israel unprovoked. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=787.74s)]
*  And there had been a tit for tat going back and forth between the two sides, sort of a simmering fighting. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=796.94s)]
*  And that's clearly escalated over the course of the last few weeks, leading ultimately to the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, over the weekend. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=802.86s)]
*  Are you hearing anything at this point, Nick, from the IDF in terms of how if this strike impact their plans going forward on the ground there in Lebanon? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=812.62s)]
*  They're not speaking about that at the moment. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=829.22s)]
*  I expect them to continue. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=831.66s)]
*  I don't expect Iran strikes to significantly impact what's going on at the moment. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=833.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, part of part of Iran's calculation about why it needed to respond now and didn't respond sooner when Hezbollah has been attacked so significantly, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=839.42s)]
*  its leader taken down, its command and control taken down, its missile firing capability taken down. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=850.86s)]
*  And I think what we've witnessed this evening is instructive about Hezbollah's ability to join the fight to support Iran, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=857.74s)]
*  because Hezbollah has always been viewed as that proxy that's so close to Israel that is really Iran's main way of hitting back at Israel if if Israel had ever chosen to strike at Iran. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=866.1800000000001s)]
*  And the fact that Hezbollah didn't fire a lot of missiles this evening, I think is important. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=879.1800000000001s)]
*  But it will have been recognized in Iran that because Hezbollah has been so knocked back, if you will, at the moment, that they're not a credible deterrent. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=884.4599999999999s)]
*  And therefore it meant Israel had the potential to hit Iran, should it so choose, more readily, more easily, with less consequence. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=895.26s)]
*  And perhaps this is why Iran chose to decide to decide to, you know, issue in essence its own deterrence right now in support of Hezbollah, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=905.54s)]
*  but also much more so in support and protection, they would see it of themselves potentially. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=916.38s)]
*  Nick Robertson, thank you so much. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=922.66s)]
*  Let's turn to CNN Chief National Security correspondent Alex Marquardt, who joins us now as does CNN military analyst and retired Army four star general Wesley Clark, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=925.2199999999999s)]
*  CNN global affairs analyst Kimberly Dozier and New York Times White House national security correspondent David Sanger. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=933.74s)]
*  Alex, let's start with you. The Pentagon detailed their efforts today to defend Israel. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=940.7s)]
*  The president also coming out saying that he fully supports Israel and the administration echoing some of the words they said following Iran's last attack in April. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=945.3000000000001s)]
*  And that is Iran appears defeated and it was ineffective. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=956.34s)]
*  And the only words we didn't hear this time from the president that was reported then was take the win. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=959.86s)]
*  Don't respond here. I'm imagining they're anticipating Israel to respond more aggressively than they did last time. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=965.9000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that is certainly I think part of the message that we're hearing from the Biden administration now is, you know, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=973.3000000000001s)]
*  that there was not that much damage done. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=978.7s)]
*  So in essence, you know, calibrate your response. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=981.3s)]
*  Now, we did hear from a number of top national security officials today in the wake of these strikes, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=985.9399999999999s)]
*  including President Joe Biden, who really highlight the fact that this was at the end of the day, a rather ineffective strike by the Iranians. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=993.66s)]
*  But at the same time, as Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said, there are going to have to be consequences. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1003.0999999999999s)]
*  I think there is certainly a realization on the American side that Israel is going to respond and respond almost certainly in a much more forceful way than they did after the last Iranian salvo on on on April 13th. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1009.62s)]
*  Our colleague, Orin Lieberman, over the Pentagon, asked the spokesman there point blank whether the U.S. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1025.54s)]
*  would be participating in an Israeli response. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1030.7s)]
*  He did not say no. So essentially not ruling it out. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1035.1s)]
*  But the administration position at this point is that they are going to be having these discussions with the Israelis. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1038.7s)]
*  There's going to be some coordination with the Israelis. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1045.98s)]
*  I think there's a recognition among the Americans that essentially Israel will do what it plans to do despite whatever warnings there might be from from the U.S. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1048.38s)]
*  side. Bottom line beyond, I think the Biden administration is trying to walk this line of, yes, defending Israel, continuing to defend Israel, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1058.98s)]
*  but trying as best it can to prevent further escalation. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1067.18s)]
*  That really is the mantra that we've been hearing from the Biden administration for quite some time. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1071.54s)]
*  And so they will be calling on the Israelis to really calibrate their their response tonight as they as they plan what's next when it comes to Iran. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1076.26s)]
*  Yeah. And General Clark, we heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu telling his security cabinet that Iran, quote, made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1084.5s)]
*  In your assessment, I know the United States is publicly asking for a calibrated response, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1093.42s)]
*  though knowing that that Israel will have to respond more aggressively than they did last time when they targeted one missile defense program there in in Iran. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1099.34s)]
*  What is your assessment as to how Israel is likely going to respond now? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1110.22s)]
*  I think Israel is going to do the best it can to respond disproportionately because Israel knows that this is a tit for tat moment. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1117.3s)]
*  And if they come back with the same kind of response, it's sort of carefully calibrated. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1128.86s)]
*  There it's an open invitation for Iran to come again in a third strike in a later moment. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1133.86s)]
*  So I think Israel is going to muster its forces and do the best it can to be disproportionate, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1140.18s)]
*  to achieve escalation, dominance and stop the tit for tat and let Iran suffer. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1146.26s)]
*  And what are some of those options, General? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1154.3400000000001s)]
*  Is that going big where where Israel has long focused and that is Iran's nuclear program? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1157.0200000000002s)]
*  Do you think that they'll aim perhaps for their their oil depots? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1163.3000000000002s)]
*  How do you anticipate this playing out? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1168.58s)]
*  Well, the easy option is the oil export facilities and maybe some of the production that's near the Gulf. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1171.82s)]
*  The next in order of difficulty is some of the government buildings, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1179.74s)]
*  maybe the headquarters of the IRGC and its facilities. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1184.18s)]
*  And the most difficult and the most consequential is the Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1189.58s)]
*  They're well dispersed. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1194.74s)]
*  Some of some of them are in deep valleys cut back into mountains, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1196.18s)]
*  so they're going to be really difficult to get, maybe impossible to get. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1200.14s)]
*  And so without seeing the classified information that Israel is operating on and the specific weapon system, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1203.94s)]
*  I'd say it's going to be tough to go after the nuclear. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1210.3400000000001s)]
*  So government buildings, export facilities for oil, make it tough on them economically, but make them pay. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1213.74s)]
*  If it's simply a demonstration that Israel, yes, Israel can strike, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1222.02s)]
*  it doesn't achieve the effect of escalation dominance that's needed to stop the tip for that in the Middle East. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1227.74s)]
*  Kimberly, the IDF says that it will continue to attack targets across the region with force. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1235.86s)]
*  I'm assuming that this also applies to their operations in southern Lebanon as well that were launched over the last 24 hours. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1240.66s)]
*  But given what's transpired with Iran, do you expect Israel to respond sooner than they did with what many described as a proportional response following the attack back in April, which was a few days later? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1249.5s)]
*  Yeah, back in April, it was about a week that Israel responded. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1264.6200000000001s)]
*  And what it did was hit a missile battery that was responsible for protecting one of Iran's nuclear facilities, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1268.42s)]
*  which was a signal that we could hit the facility, we could hit something more valuable, but we just did this. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1278.42s)]
*  So this time, as General Clark was saying, they're going to look for something to hit that is a more painful target, something that the Iranians will find hard to replace. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1286.7s)]
*  But I think that they will try to avoid, as they have in the past, a major number of casualties, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1300.0600000000002s)]
*  because on either side, if either side launches an attack that causes a major number of troops or worse civilians to be killed, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1306.3799999999999s)]
*  that's the kind of thing that goes from escalation dominance to an escalation spiral where things spiral out of control. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1314.74s)]
*  So I think they'll choose these targets with care and the coming days will tell what they hit. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1322.1799999999998s)]
*  They'll probably brief the Americans this time because the U.S. has made it clear that this needs to be done and they're not going to stand in the way as long as it doesn't lead to all out war. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1329.42s)]
*  Well, that's the big question. And it is a slippery slope. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1343.42s)]
*  What will a response, as the general said, a disproportionate response look like without going to an all out war? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1346.42s)]
*  And David, let's go back to Iran's nuclear program, which Israel has long believed to be the biggest threat existentially to Israel at this point. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1352.78s)]
*  The United States, obviously much of the Western world also concerned about its nuclear program and how quickly it is developing, especially since President Trump got out of the JCPOA. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1362.58s)]
*  Do you think that Israel is seriously contemplating an attack against its nuclear facilities right now? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1376.06s)]
*  And is it something they could do unilaterally? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1383.94s)]
*  I do think they are contemplating it because they've contemplated it for years. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1388.22s)]
*  First, like I think General Clark laid out some very good reasons why parts of it are difficult to get at. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1393.54s)]
*  They may well decide to take out one or two facilities just to send the message that they could do the others if they wanted. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1400.58s)]
*  There are a few, including the Natanz nuclear enrichment site, which is what the US and Israel jointly hit with a major cyber attack now 14, 15 years ago that started off the age of cyber wars. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1409.1s)]
*  That's not that deep. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1424.62s)]
*  And the Iranians are building a new facility that doesn't have any nuclear material in it yet. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1426.1399999999999s)]
*  I could imagine that being a target because then the Israelis don't have to worry about being charged with causing a nuclear accident or the spread of nuclear material. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1432.06s)]
*  But I think that the more likely immediate target is going to be these oil facilities and so forth where they can do some significant economic damage. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1443.54s)]
*  There's a fine line between maintaining escalation dominance, as we heard from General Clark, and he's absolutely right about that, and creating enough of a movement within Iran that they feel like they've got to go the next step. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1452.58s)]
*  And that's why I think you'll hear President Biden or we will discover later that he's saying privately some version of take the win. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1468.54s)]
*  I mean, the Iranians at this point are 0 for 2. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1476.22s)]
*  They've launched two major attacks and they have failed to do much damage. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1479.58s)]
*  And that is part of what is reorienting the sense of power in the in the region right now, because they have lost some of that magic that they could do huge damage and get past their defenses. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1484.3799999999999s)]
*  But Alex, is there concern about the US's role and impact and influence in the region? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1498.22s)]
*  We'll recall in the days immediately after October 7th, President Biden firmly saying don't to any party that looked to take advantage of Israel and its fight with Hamas after the severe blow it experienced. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1505.26s)]
*  We have heard similar threats from US officials leading up to today's strikes from Iran threatening that the US would not be able to hold Israel back, threatening there would be severe consequences if Iran chose to strike. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1520.06s)]
*  And yet they did. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1535.24s)]
*  What does that tell you about the US's role and the dominance that it can still play in the region? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1536.76s)]
*  Well, certainly the their influence is being tested. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1545.4s)]
*  And I think there have been some successes for the US and there have certainly been some failures. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1548.72s)]
*  We have seen defiance, whether, you know, whether it's from Iran, you know, ignoring that don't warning or whether it's from the United States saying that they don't want Israel, for example, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1553.4s)]
*  to go on the ground into Lebanon. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1565.02s)]
*  You know, we saw last week this was highlighted in really stark terms when the United States put forward this ceasefire proposal for Lebanon. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1568.62s)]
*  And and the Israelis essentially immediately came out and saying, no, we're actually going to keep going forward with our with our ground incursion and go after Nusra. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1578.82s)]
*  We also saw after the assassination, we believe by Israel of Hamas leader of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the Americans warning the Iranians there will be consequences if you guys try to strike Israel yet again. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1589.94s)]
*  That did not happen in that instance. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1606.94s)]
*  And I think that is an example of that US, you know, that US message actually landing because the Americans made clear that there would be a there would be severe consequences for Iran's government, for their economy. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1608.78s)]
*  But, you know, when you look at the relationship now between Israel and the United States, it really is remarkable to see the amount of support that the US has given to Israel throughout this conflict. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1625.58s)]
*  A lot of the defiance that we have seen from the Israeli side, essentially ignoring a lot of the pleas from the US, some of the more critical people of the Biden administration are saying that they are, you know, they continue to give Israel weapons. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1638.3s)]
*  And that influence is not really having the intended effect when the US asks Israel, for example, to calibrate their response. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1653.1s)]
*  So I think in this situation, we're going to hear pleas again from the Biden administration to not go too far. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1662.26s)]
*  And it remains to be seen whether Israel heeds those warnings. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1668.7s)]
*  General Clark, if you were advising President Biden right now, what would you tell him is the best response the United States could provide or support the United States could provide for Israel at this point? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1673.62s)]
*  I would have been telling him all along that the theme of no escalation in the region misunderstands the psychology of the people we're working against. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1686.74s)]
*  To say that you don't want to escalate in this region is to invite the enemy to escalate against you. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1698.54s)]
*  That applied to the Houthis, the Axis of Resistance, and it applies today to Iran. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1706.3799999999999s)]
*  So I understand the concern when you're dealing with Russia. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1711.5800000000002s)]
*  I understand the president's concern about not having a nuclear confrontation. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1716.6200000000001s)]
*  This is not Russia. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1720.74s)]
*  This is the Middle East. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1722.7s)]
*  These people expect to be hammered. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1724.14s)]
*  And so the feedback I've been getting today from people all over the region is the United States told Israel told Iran not to do this. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1726.6200000000001s)]
*  But Iran didn't listen. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1734.66s)]
*  And I get this from friends, from people who are sort of neutral. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1736.42s)]
*  And and so it says that in this region, when the your opponent transgresses, you must lower the hammer. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1739.94s)]
*  You must not counsel as no escalation. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1752.02s)]
*  That's good for U.S. domestic politics. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1755.54s)]
*  It doesn't sell in the region. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1758.6599999999999s)]
*  So with respect to the Houthis, we piecemealed our response. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1761.18s)]
*  We were reactionary and defensive. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1765.6599999999999s)]
*  We could have done much more. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1767.7s)]
*  The Houthis are still in place and they think they've the Iranians think they were successful. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1769.22s)]
*  And we can say all we want that their strike was ineffective and so forth. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1775.34s)]
*  They're measuring it by some of those missiles got through. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1780.1799999999998s)]
*  And if they succeed in taking the pain from Israel, they're going to say to themselves, you see, the Americans, the Israelis, they're not that tough. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1783.5s)]
*  We'll go after them again. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1794.8999999999999s)]
*  So we have to really understand what the psychology in this region is. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1796.7s)]
*  Must have dominate escalation. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1800.58s)]
*  Must have escalation dominance. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1803.82s)]
*  Use dominating force in response. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1805.54s)]
*  That's what I told the president. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1808.06s)]
*  All right. Thank you so much. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1810.34s)]
*  Thanks to my panel. Really appreciate it. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1811.6599999999999s)]
*  More now from the Israeli end. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1813.7s)]
*  Here was a spokesman for the IDF right after the attack. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1815.5s)]
*  Iran's attack is a severe and dangerous escalation. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1820.7s)]
*  There will be consequences. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1825.14s)]
*  Our defensive and offensive capabilities are at the highest levels of readiness. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1827.46s)]
*  Our operational plans are ready. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1833.26s)]
*  We will respond wherever, whenever and however we choose. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1836.54s)]
*  My next guest says nothing may be off the table in retaliation, including Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1843.98s)]
*  I'm joined now by Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the United States. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1849.8600000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. Ambassador, for joining us. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1854.3s)]
*  I'm wondering if you were able to listen to that previous conversation, specifically the last comments there from General Wesley Clark, that the psychology of this region does not permit the U.S. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1856.6200000000001s)]
*  president or the Israelis to respond to attack like this by echoing de-escalation now. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1868.98s)]
*  I would imagine you agree with that assessment. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1876.9s)]
*  Good evening. And I certainly agree with every word that General Clark said. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1878.98s)]
*  Calls for de-escalation are interpreted by the Iranians as weakness, and they will then exploit that weakness and attack Israel again. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1883.18s)]
*  In order to de-escalate in the Middle East, you have to escalate. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1890.18s)]
*  The Iranians have to internalize that if they perpetrate this type of flagrant aggression against Israel and Israel on all fronts, it's not just with these rockets that they are going to pay a prohibitive, very painful price. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1893.1000000000001s)]
*  We talked about the president's warning early in the war. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  Don't. Don't to Iran. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1910.4599999999998s)]
*  Don't to Hezbollah. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1911.86s)]
*  They both did. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1913.06s)]
*  And there's a big question now whether the United States is willing to put teeth into the don't to make the Iranians understand that they fire not just at Israel, but some 200 times they fired at American bases in Syria and Iraq. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1914.58s)]
*  They've closed international shipping through the Straits of Mandab that there's a price to be paid. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1925.9799999999998s)]
*  And up to this point, Iran has really gotten away price free. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1930.86s)]
*  No one has actually extracted a price from Iran. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1934.46s)]
*  That has to end. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1936.66s)]
*  And it's probably going to end in the next 24 hours. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1937.6200000000001s)]
*  So we're expecting a kinetic response, no doubt, from Israel. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1939.9s)]
*  Are you suggesting that they should not go about this unilaterally and that the United States should also retaliate kinetically? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1943.42s)]
*  Well, Israel is a major military power, but we don't have the same capabilities that the United States has. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1950.98s)]
*  The United States has very large military assets in the Middle East, aircraft carriers, F-22 fighters, even a nuclear submarine. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1955.94s)]
*  The Iranians, I think, should be made to understand that these forces are in the Middle East not just in a defensive posture, but potentially, potentially in an offensive position as well. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1964.18s)]
*  The United States willing to extract that type of peace. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1973.78s)]
*  You know, I listened to that panel was a fascinating panel before Vienna and talking about the fears in the United States. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1976.42s)]
*  And I understand them fully of a wider regional conflict. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1981.58s)]
*  But from Israel's perspective, we have been in a regional war. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1985.02s)]
*  We've been in a regional war since October 7th. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1987.8999999999999s)]
*  And that war now is an all out war. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1990.1s)]
*  We are in a war for our national survival period. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1992.34s)]
*  And Israel, as a state created in the aftermath of the Holocaust, is going to do everything in its power and its duty. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=1995.6999999999998s)]
*  And I think also it's right to defend itself. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2002.3s)]
*  It seems clear now looking at Israel's response over the past few weeks and really being able to decapitate most of Hezbollah's leadership, including Hassan Nasrallah, with that assassination, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2005.62s)]
*  the the beepers and then the walkie talkies exploding, they were able to infiltrate and prepare for a war with Iran in ways that they were not with Hamas, unfortunately, leading up to October 7th. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2019.3s)]
*  Do you think that given how focused Israel was on a potential war with Hezbollah, they factored in already what a potential war with Iran would look like as well? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2032.82s)]
*  I'm sure they have. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2045.46s)]
*  That's that's part of the job of military planners to take into consideration every possible contingency and to plan accordingly and to identify targets and and to give options to Israel's decision makers. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2046.54s)]
*  They have to do that. Keep in mind, again, we are a military power. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2058.1s)]
*  We are not the United States of America. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2061.78s)]
*  And we very much appreciated the help that we received from these American forces in the Middle East in intercepting these rockets. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2063.18s)]
*  It's very, very much valued. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2069.26s)]
*  But Israel, I would not underestimate our capabilities. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2071.3s)]
*  We have capabilities that we haven't used yet. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2075.22s)]
*  Israel has rockets to Israel, has missiles to Israel, has submarines. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2077.46s)]
*  And someone would have said it would have been impossible to eliminate Mr. Hassan Nasrallah about a week ago because he was under 60 feet of solid concrete. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2080.94s)]
*  And Israel doesn't have strategic bombers like the United States. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2091.14s)]
*  It can't drop a 50,000 pound bomb. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2093.3399999999997s)]
*  But we have f-15s and f-16s and f-35s that can hit a target like that repeatedly and penetrate it. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2095.58s)]
*  And I think that's an example that the Iranians should take to heart. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2101.2599999999998s)]
*  Going back to what General Clark said about understanding the psychology of the region, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2105.02s)]
*  what comes with that is maybe hearing one thing publicly from leaders and hearing something quite different behind closed doors. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2109.22s)]
*  As Israel is calibrating what their response may look like, you were plugged in. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2116.9s)]
*  How do you think some of the regional countries there, some of the Sunni nations there in the Gulf are hoping or preparing for Israel to respond? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2122.38s)]
*  When I first heard about the operation to eliminate Nasrallah, I turned to a colleague and I said, oh, we just got peace with Saudi Arabia. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2131.82s)]
*  There may be countries in the world with whom we have strained relations, certainly in South America and elsewhere. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2139.1000000000004s)]
*  But it's interesting that the signatory countries to the Abraham Accords have really held fast. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2145.98s)]
*  And they've held fast not because they love us, Brianna, because they are facing twin existential threats from Sunni extremism in the form of the Muslim Brotherhood, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2149.98s)]
*  al-Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas and Shiite extremism, the form of Iran and Hezbollah. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2159.58s)]
*  There's there's one country in the Middle East that is standing up to both of these enemies and not running away. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2164.8199999999997s)]
*  And one country in the Middle East tonight, which is prevailing over those enemies. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2170.58s)]
*  So if we win this war and however you define winning it, if we if we degrade Hamas to the point it can no longer threaten us, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2174.54s)]
*  if we can certainly deter Iran and Iran and Iran and Hezbollah, we'll get peace. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2181.98s)]
*  And, you know, John Lennon somewhere probably wouldn't like me saying this. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2188.46s)]
*  But if you want peace, you're going to have to give war a chance in the Middle East. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2191.78s)]
*  Yeah, I guess then comes the the question that we've been constantly asking. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2194.7s)]
*  And that is what the day after plan may be. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2198.9s)]
*  And that applies to Gaza. And I guess that also applies to Lebanon now and potentially even Iran. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2201.38s)]
*  Ambassador Michael Oren, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2207.06s)]
*  Have a quiet evening. Thank you. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2209.42s)]
*  You too. Well, expanding now on the reaction in Washington, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2210.58s)]
*  President Biden today said that he is in what he calls active discussion of how Israel should respond. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2214.54s)]
*  That conversation, though, does not yet include Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2220.7s)]
*  I haven't spoken to him. We've spoken we have spoken with all his people and I'll be talking to him. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2226.34s)]
*  And my message will depend on what we find finally conclude is needed. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2231.1s)]
*  For more on all this, CNN's Kayla Tausche joins us now from the White House. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2237.14s)]
*  Kayla, forgive me. I don't recall how much time passed from the Iranian missile attack back in April, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2240.02s)]
*  from when that occurred to when there was a conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2246.22s)]
*  Does it seem a bit odd that the two we haven't gotten any indication of the two have yet to speak? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2252.9s)]
*  Well, U.S. officials say that because the teams are working hand in glove and because they're in constant contact, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2259.18s)]
*  basically at every level from staff to principal to essentially the cabinet secretary level, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2264.9s)]
*  that at this point, there's not a need for President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu to speak directly. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2270.62s)]
*  Of course, as you heard, President Biden say that could change once there is a conclusion about how to proceed, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2276.42s)]
*  which at this point there simply is not. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2281.86s)]
*  It's still a live discussion how the U.S. anticipates Israel would respond and what consequences the U.S. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2284.1s)]
*  could levy on Iran itself if, as you were just noting in your prior conversation, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2289.94s)]
*  that is a direction that the U.S. decides to move in. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2295.2200000000003s)]
*  But these are live, active discussions. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2297.82s)]
*  They were lengthy discussions that took place today in the Situation Room, yesterday in the Oval Office, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2299.7000000000003s)]
*  and they will continue until, I am told, a decision is reached. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2304.42s)]
*  Yeah, and this all happened so quickly. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2307.58s)]
*  It's important to remind viewers that this intelligence that Iran was about to launch ballistic missiles towards Israel came from the United States. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2309.94s)]
*  Earlier today, in giving Israel a few hours' heads-up notice about this intelligence they received, that an attack was imminent. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2319.74s)]
*  They did, yes. That intelligence did come to the United States, and they first delivered that warning to Israel directly [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2329.18s)]
*  before declaring it publicly to inform the world that this was happening. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2335.14s)]
*  You know, it's a strategy that the U.S. has employed in various situations to varying degrees of success. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2339.18s)]
*  I mean, you might remember that in the months leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2345.5s)]
*  the U.S. did what it called radical declassification of intelligence to warn the world that there were troops building up on the border. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2349.94s)]
*  Now the administration has seemed to become more comfortable disclosing these threats as if to put the world on alert that these things are happening [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2356.2200000000003s)]
*  and to essentially put some of those adversaries like Iran on alert that the U.S. is prepared to assist and defend allies like Israel, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2364.54s)]
*  which is, of course, exactly what happened today, Viana. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2371.54s)]
*  All right, Kayla Toschi, thank you so much. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2374.42s)]
*  Now joining us, National Security Analyst Beth Saner. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2377.26s)]
*  She's a former deputy director of national intelligence. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2379.98s)]
*  Director Saner, what a day today was, what a week today felt like at the very least. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2383.5s)]
*  Just your reaction, given the unprecedented nature of the attack that we saw once again, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2390.02s)]
*  twice the number of ballistic missiles from Iran sent directly against Israel. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2395.9s)]
*  Thankfully, I think there was only one fatality that we've reported thus far, a few casualties. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2401.74s)]
*  Your reaction to what's transpired. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2407.3399999999997s)]
*  I do think it's this pace, right, that if you think about how much has happened in the last seven weeks [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2411.3799999999997s)]
*  and how much has changed in terms of the strength of the different parties involved, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2419.22s)]
*  in terms of now the shifting calculus and what we're seeing before our very eyes are actually shifting war goals, right? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2426.38s)]
*  And so the danger when you get into these situations, from my perspective, is that, you know, we've gone from Israel trying to, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2435.38s)]
*  you know, deal with Gaza, then shifting to the north and then not just trying to push a buffer zone, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2445.02s)]
*  but literally to decapitate Hezbollah. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2452.7s)]
*  And now we're in this Iran, the head of the Hydra. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2455.7799999999997s)]
*  And the danger is that we can have two things. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2460.8999999999996s)]
*  One is that we're not following the shift in goals and we're not actually preparing mentally, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2465.02s)]
*  thinking through the implications as we move up this ladder of what we want or what Israel wants, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2470.5s)]
*  what the United States wants, how those things are different. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2477.2999999999997s)]
*  And also this risk of kind of irrational exuberance because it has been wildly successful. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2480.2599999999998s)]
*  Then you kind of bake into this linear track that whatever you do, it's going to continue to be successful. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2487.54s)]
*  But as we've seen, we're not really seeing Israel done or have a strategic plan for Gaza, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2494.8999999999996s)]
*  let alone Lebanon, what you just said, Bianna, let alone Iran. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2501.4199999999996s)]
*  So we have kind of a gap in our understanding, our sense of what's happening and where everyone is trying to get. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2504.94s)]
*  We heard multiple times now over the past few months from Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett publicly saying that [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2513.62s)]
*  the number one priority is to destroy Iran's nuclear program. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2521.18s)]
*  And he described it as Iran being the head of an octopus and all of its proxies and the access of resistance being the tentacles. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2525.82s)]
*  And he today again, doubled down on this being an opportunity for Israel to go after Iran's nuclear program. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2534.74s)]
*  Do you think that that is a smart tactic now for Israel to take? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2543.18s)]
*  The question isn't just whether it's a smart tactic for Israel to take, because they really, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2551.4599999999996s)]
*  I don't think in my view, can do that completely unilaterally. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2556.2999999999997s)]
*  So the question for Americans is whether we want to join into that process. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2560.46s)]
*  It's one thing to strike some nuclear related facilities. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2566.46s)]
*  That's not destroying Iran's nuclear program. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2570.14s)]
*  And I think at this point, it's very, very hard militarily to destroy the entire program, although you can set it back significantly. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2573.46s)]
*  So I think that this is what the White House is grappling with right now. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2582.46s)]
*  One is what do we want? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2586.86s)]
*  And number two, what's our ability to affect both Israel and Iran? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2588.38s)]
*  And U.S. assessing a sort of cost benefit analysis, is this the time where the U.S. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2595.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean, we're approaching an election for about a year now. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2601.9s)]
*  We've heard this Biden administration continue to stress that the need for de-escalation. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2606.5s)]
*  It seems that Israel in the United States, while both hoping to achieve the same goal, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2613.7s)]
*  and that is a nuclear free Iran, appear to be going about it at much different paces and paths. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2618.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that the Biden administration has shifted paths. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2627.3799999999997s)]
*  You know, they're not in the JCPOA 2.0 realm anymore, which I didn't think was really possible at this point in Iran's nuclear program. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2631.42s)]
*  But, you know, the idea here is that neither the Biden or the Trump administration has had [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2642.3s)]
*  coherent and consistent deterrence policies toward Iran. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2649.9s)]
*  And, you know, what we have been doing, especially in the past year, you know, if you just look at what was said [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2655.42s)]
*  most recently before this little exchange was President Biden said, well, you know, if you attack Israel, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2665.42s)]
*  we will not be able to protect or we will not be able to prevent Israel from striking you. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2675.7400000000002s)]
*  That is not where we want to be. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2681.66s)]
*  We want to be saying what we are going to do. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2684.62s)]
*  That is deterrence. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2689.02s)]
*  Deterrence is about you as the actor setting the minds of the adversary that if they act in a certain way, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2691.62s)]
*  we are going to act back in a way that will make that price too high for you. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2701.54s)]
*  We're not doing that, and we did not do that consistently in the Trump administration either. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2708.98s)]
*  So we need a big change on that. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2714.74s)]
*  One thing we heard today, and I guess this once again reminds us of some perspective, [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2717.14s)]
*  is an IDF spokesperson say that no country would tolerate one ballistic missile launched against them, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2721.94s)]
*  much less almost 200, now twice, from Iran. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2729.94s)]
*  How do you couple that with the United States publicly putting out a statement that Israel should, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2736.1s)]
*  again, sort of take this as a win, that Iran is proven to be defeated and ineffective? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2742.02s)]
*  Yeah, I think that that, you know, honestly, it is not probably the best long term policy, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2750.58s)]
*  because when you allow foreign actors, adversaries to act with impunity, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2760.58s)]
*  then they are going to act the same way or worse again. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2767.22s)]
*  This is what we're seeing with Russia. This is what we fear about China, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2771.2200000000003s)]
*  and this is certainly what is happening with Iran. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2775.2200000000003s)]
*  So, you know, you have to make the price high and too high for them to do it again. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2778.42s)]
*  And so there has to be some sort of response. We don't need to tell Israel that. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2785.7000000000003s)]
*  They are going to do it whether we like it or not, and we would do the same. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2790.82s)]
*  Beth Saner, thank you so much for your time. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2796.26s)]
*  We turn now to Lebanon, which was the focus just 24 hours ago, with Israel launching [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2798.3399999999997s)]
*  limited ground operations there. CNN's Jemana Karachi is in Beirut tonight. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2804.58s)]
*  Jemana, what is the situation on the ground where you are? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2809.54s)]
*  Are these limited and precise incursions as Israel has described them? Have they continued? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2813.62s)]
*  Well, you know, Bianna, as we understand from security sources, a source with the United Nations [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2820.3399999999997s)]
*  Peacekeeping Force, UNIFEL, as well as two Lebanese senior security sources, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2825.62s)]
*  they've told us that what they've seen was these sporadic raids where Israeli forces [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2832.8199999999997s)]
*  would come across the border and then cross back into Israel, saying that there's no [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2838.9s)]
*  presence of Israeli forces on the ground. But that was the first time that they had seen [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2843.94s)]
*  Israeli forces on the ground. But that was hours ago, and the situation may have changed [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2848.74s)]
*  since communications are very difficult with much of the border area in the south. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2853.9399999999996s)]
*  But what we have seen also, Bianna, is throughout the day, you had airstrikes, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2859.22s)]
*  artillery shelling. We'd heard from people there on the ground saying that [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2864.8999999999996s)]
*  people were trying to evacuate their homes. They were trying to get out. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2868.66s)]
*  They got evacuation orders as well from the Israeli military to 27 [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2871.54s)]
*  villages around the border region and other parts of the south, telling them that they had [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2876.1s)]
*  to evacuate immediately. But people were saying because of the intensity of the strikes and the [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2881.06s)]
*  shelling, they could not leave. They were trying to ask the Lebanese army to get them out. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2885.94s)]
*  And what we saw later on in the day, as Israel came under that attack by Iran, it seemed like [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2890.74s)]
*  there was a bit of a lull in these airstrikes and these attacks across Lebanon. But within hours of [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2898.18s)]
*  it seems that these airstrikes have resumed. We've received reports from southern Lebanon [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2906.34s)]
*  many areas that are under Israeli bombardment, as well as here in Beirut, Bianna. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2911.78s)]
*  We have seen the Israeli military's Arabic language spokesman with posts on X since [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2918.02s)]
*  midnight. That's about three hours ago and up until a few minutes ago, posting these warnings [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2924.5800000000004s)]
*  to the residents of several neighborhoods, several areas in the southern suburbs of Beirut, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2931.78s)]
*  not far from where we are, asking them to evacuate, saying that specifying buildings and maps, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2938.34s)]
*  saying you're near Hezbollah facilities and that these facilities will be targeted and you must [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2944.42s)]
*  leave immediately. Keeping in mind, Bianna, that it's midnight, it's two o'clock, three o'clock in [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2949.6200000000003s)]
*  the morning. People are not going to be sitting and going through their social media and seeing [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2954.82s)]
*  these warnings. And it's been windy and rainy. And you have so many people who've had to leave [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2959.06s)]
*  their homes in the southern suburbs, up to a million people who've been displaced [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2964.5s)]
*  just in a matter of days who've ended up on the streets. And while this is happening, we've also [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2968.9s)]
*  heard blasts from the southern suburbs and smoke rising according to images that we have seen as [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2976.02s)]
*  well. So, you know, when you have both sides continuing this fight, of course, with Hezbollah [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2982.34s)]
*  still continuing to attack Israel, firing barrages of rockets throughout the day, and then you have [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2988.7400000000002s)]
*  the strikes ongoing, you have a civilian population that's trapped in the middle. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=2995.94s)]
*  Yeah, and not knowing how long this can continue. As you note, some one million people are already [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3000.5s)]
*  displaced in this conflict over the course of the last several months. Jamona Karachi, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3006.26s)]
*  thank you so much. Well, more perspective now from Stephen Cook and Ray Takei, both our senior [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3011.46s)]
*  fellows from Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, also with us, David Daud, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3017.7s)]
*  a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy. Stephen, it was just, I believe, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3022.34s)]
*  a day, maybe two ago that we were talking about the significance of Israel's targeted limited [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3028.34s)]
*  incursions into southern Lebanon. However, they were describing it. It was something we haven't [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3034.42s)]
*  seen in nearly 20 years. How are you now looking at the situation given that Iran today launched an [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3039.22s)]
*  unprecedented 200, nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel? Well, thanks, Bianna. Clearly, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3048.8999999999996s)]
*  the Iranians are intent on escalating in response to Israel's operations in Lebanon and the killing [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3057.7799999999997s)]
*  of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The ball is now in the Israeli court. They have promised a [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3063.14s)]
*  very significant response, and I expect that we'll see that in the coming day. The Iranians have [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3069.3799999999997s)]
*  crossed a number of Israeli red lines attacking Tel Aviv, attacking population centers, actually [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3075.8599999999997s)]
*  hitting an Israeli air base. So when the Israelis threaten that the Israeli air force will be in [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3083.14s)]
*  action and will promise a severe blow against Iran and the remaining axis of resistance, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3089.3s)]
*  I think we should believe them. David, last time when Israel responded to Iran's lobbying, some 300 [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3097.1400000000003s)]
*  projectiles towards Israel, Israel waited about a week. We had a public urge for caution [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3104.98s)]
*  from the White House and de-escalation, and that was a very limited response we ultimately saw [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3112.02s)]
*  from Israel. How quickly do you think we'll see them respond? And does it matter? Is it more [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3119.86s)]
*  about how they respond versus when? Thank you for having me on. I think the situation is [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3124.98s)]
*  fundamentally different now. The Israelis are engaged in fighting against one of Iran's critical [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3132.2599999999998s)]
*  assets. There was a statement earlier today by the Israel Air Force that there will be strikes, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3137.86s)]
*  to quote, throughout the Middle East. My sense is perhaps the Israelis may target [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3143.2200000000003s)]
*  Iran's regional assets, its militias, rather than go for what they did last time, which is a symbolic [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3148.9s)]
*  strike on Iranian defense arrays, to send the message to the Iranians that we can reach you [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3154.58s)]
*  anytime and even your defensive systems can't stop us. I think if you really want to do damage [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3160.26s)]
*  to Iran, if you really want to set them back and not escalate beyond where we are now, you want to [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3164.9s)]
*  go after their regional assets. This is the source of Iran's strength, the source of Iran's projection [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3171.46s)]
*  power. And if you're dismantling Hezbollah, if you're dealing critical damage to Hezbollah, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3176.42s)]
*  I think that could do more damage to Iran and its projection power than a symbolic strike, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3180.58s)]
*  perhaps, on Iranian territory. Ray, we have new leadership in Iran. Some are saying that Iran [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3185.7000000000003s)]
*  miscalculated, given the severity of these strikes today. Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying that [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3190.9s)]
*  Iran made a big mistake and will pay for it. Is this a miscalculation from Iran, the magnitude of [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3197.94s)]
*  this strike? Well, it certainly is a miscalculation for the new president who has tried to have a new [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3206.34s)]
*  diplomatic outreach to the United States and even to resume nuclear negotiations. In terms of the [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3214.1800000000003s)]
*  leadership of Iran, they seem to believe that they have a right to strike Israel whenever Israel [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3220.5s)]
*  is doing something in the region that they don't like. And they have three audiences that they have [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3225.46s)]
*  to deal with and placate. Number one is, of course, the axis of resistance itself, not just Hezbollah, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3229.78s)]
*  but also a domestic audience. This is a regime that rules by fear. And if it's viewed as emasculated [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3237.62s)]
*  and weak in front of this population, then it will suffer domestic consequences. And finally, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3244.74s)]
*  establishing some sort of a deterrence against Israel, that required a very substantial response [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3248.74s)]
*  by them. And you saw an indication of that today. Stephen, one would assume that Israel perhaps was [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3253.14s)]
*  anticipating following the assassination of Ismail Kaniya and, I'm sorry, of Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3259.2999999999997s)]
*  And then, yes, let's go back to the assassination of Ismail Kaniya. I don't believe Israel ever [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3266.8999999999996s)]
*  took credit for that, but that happened in Tehran. Do you believe that Israel expected [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3272.42s)]
*  this scale of a response from Iran, given the pressure that this new leadership was under, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3280.58s)]
*  given the pressure that's been reported over the past few days within Iran, that Hezbollah [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3286.1s)]
*  itself was frustrated that Iran hadn't responded yet? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3293.38s)]
*  Indeed, Biana, this, according to the Iranians, this is a retaliation for both the killing of [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3296.34s)]
*  Ismail Kaniya in Tehran earlier in the summer and the recent killing of Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3302.18s)]
*  I think the Israelis had to expect a very significant Iranian response. I think that [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3309.06s)]
*  there was some chatter ahead of this attack, that the attack would look similar to what we saw in [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3314.5s)]
*  April. I was somewhat skeptical of that, given the amount of damage that the Israelis had done [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3320.58s)]
*  inflicted on Hezbollah, its primary proxy in the axis of resistance. Hezbollah has become [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3326.1s)]
*  essentially an expeditionary force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3332.18s)]
*  And even though there is a new Iranian president who sent out [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3336.66s)]
*  feelers to the West in the United States, we know, per my colleague Ray Takei, that the [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3341.14s)]
*  leadership of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, is much more hard-lined than [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3346.8199999999997s)]
*  it has been before. So I think the Israelis must have been prepared for the fact that the [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3352.2599999999998s)]
*  Iranians would respond and respond in a very significant way. David, one of the successes, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3357.2999999999997s)]
*  if you want to call it that, following Iran's attack, initial attack against Israel in April, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3361.62s)]
*  was not only once again Israel's air defense system proving how strong and successful they are, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3368.8999999999996s)]
*  but also the United States and other regional countries stepping up and also deflecting [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3374.74s)]
*  these missiles. Right now, we know the U.S. Navy destroyers fired approximately a dozen [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3382.8999999999996s)]
*  interceptors, but I don't believe we're hearing yet, and we did at this point in April, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3388.74s)]
*  as to what other countries may have done. What does that tell you in terms of any actions they [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3395.3799999999997s)]
*  may have taken in thwarting what could have been a worse attack? Well, as far as I know, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3402.42s)]
*  the Jordanians also took action to help thwart the attack. Look, there's a distinction between [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3407.86s)]
*  this attack and the one that happened in April. Iran didn't telegraph this one as much as it did [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3413.14s)]
*  the last one. That gave time for not just the Israelis to prepare, as happened in this case, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3417.78s)]
*  but for regional countries to prepare for an imminent strike. This didn't happen this time, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3422.1800000000003s)]
*  so scrambling forces at the last minute was probably not possible. That's probably why we [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3426.82s)]
*  saw some countries sit out the fight this time, but I think it's also beneficial that the Israelis [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3433.38s)]
*  were the ones to thwart the majority of this attack on their own. It helps restore Israeli [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3438.98s)]
*  deterrence. Part of the Iranian narrative that emerged and the resistance axis narrative that [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3442.6600000000003s)]
*  emerged after the April attack is that, poor Israel, the entire world needs to step in to save it [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3448.02s)]
*  from mighty Iran. And this time, we clearly see that the Israelis primarily, they're the ones to [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3453.54s)]
*  blunt this attack, to intercept it. The Iranians are still trying to spin this as a victory, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3460.5s)]
*  but I think they'll have a much harder time to project that image of strength and that Israel [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3464.5s)]
*  is this helpless actor that needs the entire world to come to its defense against the resistance [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3469.62s)]
*  axis. Yeah, much of these missiles were indeed intercepted by Israel itself. Ray, how much should [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3474.18s)]
*  the U.S. consider what counter response, assuming now Israel will respond more aggressively, what a [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3481.62s)]
*  counter response from Iran may look like in terms of any impact it has on U.S. interests and assets [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3488.02s)]
*  in the region, not just Israel? It depends on the scale of Israeli retaliation and how widespread [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3493.7s)]
*  it is and what damage it does. So it will be proportional to that. The Iranians can be canonized [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3500.8199999999997s)]
*  to, of course, launch attacks to proxies on American installations in Baghdad and Iraq and [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3506.74s)]
*  elsewhere, Houthis intersecting with international commerce. But right now, we're in an escalatory [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3511.8599999999997s)]
*  dynamic that's going to be determined by the scale of Israeli retaliation and whether there [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3517.62s)]
*  will be an Iranian response of same measure at the same time. All right, Ray Takeh, Stephen Cook, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3521.54s)]
*  David Daud, thank you so much. And for everyone else joining us, thank you so much. Welcome again [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3527.54s)]
*  to CNN.com special coverage of Iran's missile attack on Israel, a country already fighting [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3533.06s)]
*  a two front war against Hamas in Gaza and Iran's proxy Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Then just [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3538.58s)]
*  hours after Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon overnight, Iran opened fire. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3545.38s)]
*  One of the nearly 200 missiles Iran fired. We don't have a video for you. We'll show that to [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3553.54s)]
*  you momentarily. This one landing not far from the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3558.26s)]
*  there. You see it direct hit there, not on the intelligence agency, but you see that not all [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3564.82s)]
*  of these missiles were intercepted. Israel's anti-missile system helped by American seaborne [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3571.1400000000003s)]
*  defenses knock down many, but not all of the incoming. Remarkably, the strike Iran's second [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3576.1800000000003s)]
*  this year only caused one fatality. It was, though, about twice the size of the first strike in April [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3581.78s)]
*  and drew this warning from Israel's prime minister. Iran made a big mistake tonight [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3588.02s)]
*  and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3595.3s)]
*  and our determination to retaliate against our enemies. Now, earlier tonight, retired army [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3601.14s)]
*  four star general Wesley Clark told me that Israel may need to strike back disproportionately [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3607.14s)]
*  to restore, in his words, escalation dominance. As our guest just said a moment ago, Iran crossed [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3612.66s)]
*  a number of Israeli red lines, including by attacking Tel Aviv as CNN's Jim Schuto witnessed [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3618.98s)]
*  firsthand. Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. Okay, guys, we got to get off the roof. These are coming down [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3624.8199999999997s)]
*  right next to us here. Please do, Jim. Please do. CNN's Jim Schuto starts us off this hour. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3633.46s)]
*  What an intense day it has been for you, Jim. Give us your thoughts and perspective [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3640.58s)]
*  on what has just occurred within the last six hours in Israel and perhaps what we may see in [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3647.22s)]
*  the hours and days to come now in response. Listen, this was a major attack, twice as big [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3652.58s)]
*  as the attack in April, which was already unprecedented in its scope in terms of Iran [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3660.8199999999997s)]
*  striking Israel. Yes, it is true that the vast majority of the missiles were shot down, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3666.5s)]
*  but we've learned in the aftermath that some missiles or at least the fragments of missiles, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3673.38s)]
*  but based on the speed at which they hit the ground, it appears that some missiles themselves [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3678.58s)]
*  got through the defenses, striking an Israeli air base, but also striking quite close to the [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3682.42s)]
*  headquarters of Mossad, which is just to the north of us where we're standing here. It seems like [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3688.7400000000002s)]
*  good fortune played a role and there not being more casualties than the one that's been reported [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3693.78s)]
*  so far in the West Bank. So this was a big attack, even if Israel, along with US help, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3698.42s)]
*  was able to shoot most of these missiles down. Now the focus invariably, Bianna, is how, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3704.9s)]
*  is on how Israel is going to respond. Israeli officials have been quite public saying that [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3710.34s)]
*  there will be serious consequences. They held a cabinet meeting tonight. The range of options [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3715.06s)]
*  go right up to attacking Iranian nuclear sites. I'm not saying they've decided to do that, but [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3720.42s)]
*  that is apparently under discussion and that would be an enormous escalation and it's hard to see how [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3727.7000000000003s)]
*  you would avoid a larger conflict if that were to be the case. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3736.9s)]
*  Yeah, and Jim, we said thankfully that there weren't more casualties in this barrage of missiles [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3741.3s)]
*  that Iran launched against Israel, but sadly we do know that there were seven people killed today [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3748.1s)]
*  in a shooting and stabbing attack in Tel Aviv just south of where you are right now. Israeli police [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3754.2599999999998s)]
*  are indeed calling it a terror attack. What more do we know about it? Yeah, listen, on any other day [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3759.94s)]
*  that would be the lead story, right? It's been some time since you've had a terror attack that [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3768.18s)]
*  deadly inside Israel. It took place at a light rail station. Apparently the circumstances are that [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3773.38s)]
*  two attackers assaulted a soldier carrying a weapon, an Israeli soldier, then took that weapon [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3779.54s)]
*  from him and then shot these six people there on their way home, right, from work. A major terror [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3785.3s)]
*  attack on the streets here, being investigated as a terror attack, I should say, without any [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3792.82s)]
*  certainty at this point as to who was behind it. But it just shows that, listen, this region, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3798.34s)]
*  and of course that happens hours after Israeli forces go on the ground in southern Lebanon, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3805.06s)]
*  right, an escalation in its own right. This is a war on so many fronts, including the home front, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3810.1800000000003s)]
*  as that apparent terror attack showed, and it just adds to the risk of a broader conflict. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3816.26s)]
*  I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, Jim, the last time you were there, there was a thwarted [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3823.1400000000003s)]
*  terror attack, suspect carrying a bomb. You're absolutely right. Yeah. So again, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3827.54s)]
*  you're right. It was a man carrying a backpack blew up and the thinking was that had he gotten [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3833.46s)]
*  to his target, there would have been casualties. Yeah. Well, Jim Shuto, it has been quite a day [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3839.3s)]
*  for you. Thank you so much for all of your reporting and please stay safe, you and your [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3843.7s)]
*  entire team there. Thank you. Let's go up the coast to CNN's Nick Robertson, who is in the northern [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3848.34s)]
*  port city of Haifa. Nick, we're learning more about the kinds of places that Iran targeted in [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3854.26s)]
*  today's attack, including an air base that you were at just a couple of days ago. What more do we know [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3860.1000000000004s)]
*  about this specific target? Well, it's a very significant air base for the Israeli Air Force. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3867.2200000000003s)]
*  It's a base that they use to project their power and sort of dominance on all the enemies that they [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3876.2599999999998s)]
*  want to reach. They project it in part, in a large part, from that base. And that's why I was there [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3885.62s)]
*  over the weekend on board a combat mission to Yemen. Part of that combat mission was to send [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3892.66s)]
*  a signal to Iran to stay out of the fight. Clearly, that message was not received in Iran. But what [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3898.74s)]
*  we're hearing from the Israeli Air Force this evening is that they still have that full [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3905.54s)]
*  capability, that full reach to be able to go the long distances. In that case, it was 1200 miles. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3911.54s)]
*  And what I witnessed was the refueling, the refuel tanker that I was on was refueling [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3919.94s)]
*  F-35 fighter jets for an hour and a half over the Red Sea as they flew towards their target. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3925.06s)]
*  So, I think the fact that the IDF is saying that this long-range capability is still intact [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3931.14s)]
*  is an indication that many of the potential targets within that massive and sprawling air base, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3939.3799999999997s)]
*  the aircraft that I saw when I was there, it appears that those are not damaged significantly, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3947.7s)]
*  that they're still intact. Now, of course, Iran tried to target this same air base back in April. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3954.42s)]
*  And the damage at that time was very minor. We don't know what's been damaged on the air [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3960.82s)]
*  base this time. But what we can say is that the missiles Iran is using have not been as accurate [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3966.7400000000002s)]
*  as Iran intended. And even if missiles came down within the air base, there is â€“ it's a massive [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3973.38s)]
*  area and plenty of scope to fall without damaging aircraft or runways. We have yet to understand [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3979.46s)]
*  what was actually hit there. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3986.6600000000003s)]
*  Nick, can I ask you how Hezbollah's reacted to news of their patron, Iran's unprecedented attack [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3988.26s)]
*  earlier today? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=3996.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really interesting, because although there's been sort of celebrations on the [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4000.1800000000003s)]
*  streets in Beirut and people letting off fireworks and celebratory gunfire in the air, there hasn't [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4004.42s)]
*  been a massive military support for Iran. Remembering that Hezbollah was the main instrument [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4013.46s)]
*  of Iran to put firepower whenever they called for it and wanted it into Israel. And tonight, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4020.98s)]
*  Iran really could have used that extra fire support to confuse the defensive systems here, to [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4028.34s)]
*  make Israel look north as well as looking east towards the missiles coming in from Iran. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4034.82s)]
*  That was absent, and that is very striking. And I think that really gets to what Israel has been [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4040.2599999999998s)]
*  able to do over the last two weeks, decimating not only the morale, the command and control, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4046.02s)]
*  the weapon stocks that Hezbollah has, and really blunting it in many ways from being an effective [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4052.18s)]
*  force. We were talking about escalation there, and about a week ago â€“ I think it was Wednesday last [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4059.14s)]
*  week â€“ Hezbollah fired a ballistic missile towards Tel Aviv. It was intercepted a couple [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4066.34s)]
*  of days later. The Houthis fired another two ballistic missiles into the center of Israel. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4073.46s)]
*  But neither of these proxies of Iran were really able to join the fight in a significant way and [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4078.98s)]
*  support Iran. And I think that's very telling about the limited power that these proxies have [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4086.6600000000003s)]
*  at the moment. And I do use the caveat at the moment because obviously the Houthis and Hezbollah [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4093.62s)]
*  will try to rebuild, will try to regroup. I was going to ask you about anything you're [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4099.78s)]
*  hearing, any concerns about an additional response again from the Houthis specifically, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4104.66s)]
*  perhaps whether it supports the city of Eilat or other areas, as you noted, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4110.82s)]
*  the missile that was launched towards Tel Aviv that was thwarted. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4116.0199999999995s)]
*  It was striking to me that the combat mission that I witnessed was targeting Houthi targets [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4119.46s)]
*  that were â€“ was a power station and a fuel supply, and it wasn't their sort of missile launching [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4132.26s)]
*  systems. And that's something that the U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea has been targeting [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4139.94s)]
*  because the Houthis have been targeting international shipping in the Red Sea. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4145.54s)]
*  It does feel at the moment as if the Houthis still have a lot of their long-range weapon systems [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4149.14s)]
*  intact and able to use. They've been fighting this long-range air campaign with Saudi Arabia [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4156.18s)]
*  for many years. They have learned how to hide their systems. That capability is still there, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4164.34s)]
*  and that is going to be a harder capability to defeat because they have air defense systems [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4169.22s)]
*  and they're flying over Yemen to try to target these sites is so much more dangerous. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4173.78s)]
*  AMNA NAWAZ [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4179.139999999999s)]
*  I want to bring in one of the best source journalists now reporting on Israeli security [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4183.42s)]
*  and foreign policy, CNN analyst and Axios reporter Barak Ravid. Barak, I've been quoting you more [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4188.099999999999s)]
*  than anyone else over the course of this last year since October 7th, and even today I was [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4193.219999999999s)]
*  quoting you. And it was your reporting, per a Western source with knowledge, that this strike [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4198.26s)]
*  was imminent, and this intelligence was coming from the United States and given Israel a few hours [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4204.34s)]
*  prior to the public. BARAK RAVID Yes. I think the Israelis and the U.S. have been following what [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4211.3s)]
*  the Iranians have been doing since the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh by Israel in Tehran [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4219.9400000000005s)]
*  two months ago. And the Iranians increased their alert levels back then, getting ready for some [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4226.82s)]
*  sort of an attack against Israel. But then, when there were still the ceasefire negotiations in [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4233.78s)]
*  Gaza, the Iranians decided to wait. And they've been waiting for two months. And 10 days ago, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4240.099999999999s)]
*  Hezbollah wanted the Iranians to help them when they were under military pressure by Israel. The [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4246.82s)]
*  Iranians said, you know what, maybe next week, because this week our president is in New York, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4252.58s)]
*  and they didn't do it. A few days later, Israel assassinated Hassan Asala, the leader of Hezbollah. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4258.58s)]
*  And right now, when the Iranians finally decided to respond, it was too late for Hezbollah. But for [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4263.94s)]
*  them, this was like the response that they've been working on for almost two months. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4271.38s)]
*  So tell me what you're hearing from your Israeli sources as to some of the options now on the table [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4276.0199999999995s)]
*  for them in a response. So there's going to be a response. I hear it loud and clear from [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4281.22s)]
*  every Israeli official I speak to and Netanyahu said it publicly. The cabinet meeting that ended [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4288.179999999999s)]
*  something like two hours ago didn't really take a decision. There was a clear understanding by all [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4295.54s)]
*  the ministers that there's going to be a response. They discussed the different options. I think [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4300.9s)]
*  there's a lot of focus on Iran's oil facilities. This is something I hear from many Israeli [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4306.5s)]
*  officials. But what I also hear is that the main question is, what is Iran going to do in response [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4312.179999999999s)]
*  to the Israeli response? And this is why the Israelis want to coordinate their retaliation [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4320.0199999999995s)]
*  with the Biden administration. And this is what has been taking place today. It's going to continue [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4326.18s)]
*  tomorrow. And I think that only after this coordination is done, we will see the Israeli [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4331.62s)]
*  response. Why? Because the Israelis think that there's a, it's highly likely that the Iranians [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4336.900000000001s)]
*  will attack again. And for that, they need the U.S. on their side for intelligence, for defense, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4342.66s)]
*  and for many other things. How far do you believe the Biden administration, from what you're hearing, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4348.900000000001s)]
*  is willing to go? The Biden administration is not against the Israeli response against Iran. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4352.82s)]
*  And White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said it today on camera in the [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4361.7s)]
*  briefing room where he said that there will be severe consequences against Iran, and the U.S. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4366.9s)]
*  will make sure that that's the case. So I think it's clear to the Biden administration that there's [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4372.74s)]
*  going to be a response. They're not against it. I think what they're trying to do is that they're [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4378.5s)]
*  trying to influence it as much as possible while knowing that U.S. influence right now on Israel [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4383.54s)]
*  is pretty limited. I guess that was my question that you had said earlier, that the U.S. seems [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4390.26s)]
*  to be on board, very much so, with Israel having to respond given the magnitude of this strike. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4395.94s)]
*  It's just a question of what role the United States will play along [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4401.86s)]
*  with that. Is it a situation where the U.S. will just once again come to Israel's defense, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4406.42s)]
*  or will we see the United States perhaps be a bit more proactive this time? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4412.0199999999995s)]
*  I have to say that even though at the moment no U.S. official will tell you this, and I think that [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4419.54s)]
*  at the moment the Biden administration is still looking at this through the lens of helping Israel [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4426.98s)]
*  in defense, if this thing continues and widens and we'll see an Israeli strike and an Iranian [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4432.26s)]
*  attack and Israeli response and Iranian retaliation, I do not rule out at all the [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4439.46s)]
*  possibility that sometime down the road, maybe before the election, maybe after the election, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4445.860000000001s)]
*  the Biden administration or President Biden himself will reach a conclusion that maybe his legacy [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4450.900000000001s)]
*  will not be peace in the Middle East, but maybe making sure that the Iranian-led access in the [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4457.7s)]
*  region takes a big hit and maybe even eliminating the Iranian nuclear program. I know it sounds now [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4463.94s)]
*  imaginary, but I would definitely not rule it out if we will see now this ongoing escalation [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4470.9s)]
*  in the next weeks. Well, we are definitely hearing pressure from some of the Republican party [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4477.7s)]
*  to do just that. Barack, I want to end and I can't believe, you know, here we are, the fast pace [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4482.34s)]
*  of what's been transpiring in the region that we have yet to bring up Gaza thus far in our [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4488.58s)]
*  programming. What, if anything, does this, how does this impact at all any ceasefire or hostage talks? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4494.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, Biana, and I know that you've been covering this issue very, very closely, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4504.9800000000005s)]
*  and I got earlier today a call from one of the families of the U.S. hostages, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4509.62s)]
*  and he asked me exactly this, what you just asked me, and the families of the hostages, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4517.62s)]
*  both the American hostages and the Israeli hostages, are desperate because they see how [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4523.14s)]
*  when Israel started fighting in Lebanon, the hostage issue and the Gaza issue took the back seat. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4528.42s)]
*  Now Israel is fighting Iran. The Lebanon issue is taking the back seat and the hostage issue [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4535.06s)]
*  is not even in the car, and I think this is very concerning, especially that we have to remember [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4540.1s)]
*  that at the end of the day, nothing is solved in Gaza. There's no day after, there's no hostage [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4545.86s)]
*  deal, there's no ceasefire, and Israel gets bogged down in Gaza, and that's a matter of great concern. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4552.82s)]
*  And as we all know, the defense establishment also saying time is running out for these hostages. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4559.54s)]
*  They are literally dying in Gaza right now as we are just days away from the one-year mark [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4564.18s)]
*  of the horrific October 7 attacks. Barak Rabid, thank you. Thank you. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4568.9800000000005s)]
*  Let's get some more perspective now from Nadav Yal, Israeli column, and newspaper columnist and [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4575.14s)]
*  senior research scholar at Columbia University, also CNN military analyst and retired army [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4579.700000000001s)]
*  Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling and former deputy director of national intelligence [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4584.66s)]
*  Beth Sanner. General Hurtling, let me start with you. Is this attack, in your view, a major turning [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4589.62s)]
*  point in the region potentially for making this a much wider conflict, perhaps even bringing the [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4595.94s)]
*  United States into the fray? Yeah, potentially, Deanna, I think it is. There's a potential for [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4604.18s)]
*  a lot of things that have resolved from this. I think Barak Rabid said it quite succinctly, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4610.82s)]
*  but I'll state it from a military standpoint. There is always an action followed by a reaction, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4616.02s)]
*  followed by a counteraction by the forces. What occurs after this original action by Iran is [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4622.42s)]
*  going to be interesting to see how far Israel takes it. It will not be a proportional response. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4628.26s)]
*  You said earlier General Clark said the same thing. I believe the same. Israel will strike hard [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4633.22s)]
*  against Iran, and they're doing it for a couple of reasons. They will see how [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4638.9800000000005s)]
*  Iran counteracts to their reaction, and it can continue to there. Now, I know that sounds silly, [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4643.46s)]
*  and it's a spiraling down, but that is the way these kind of operations work. You also have to [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4650.58s)]
*  consider, as Barak also somewhat alluded to, that Israel has experienced several existential [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4655.78s)]
*  threats lately. First, the attack from Hamas in Gaza in 7 October, followed by the beginning [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4663.139999999999s)]
*  of rocket launchers from Hezbollah on 8 October, now followed by this attack, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4670.5s)]
*  not just from the Houthis in Yemen a few days ago, but now from Iran. So you see the very bad [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4676.58s)]
*  neighborhood that Israel finds itself in, and all of them threaten the existence of Israel. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4683.7s)]
*  The United States has said they will continue to defend Israel. What might happen after that [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4690.9s)]
*  is anyone's guess, depending on how far we want to go in defending that existence of the state [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4696.1s)]
*  of Israel and how much we want to tamp down some of the threats against it, all of which are [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4702.580000000001s)]
*  terrorist actions. Yeah, and no matter what we may hear publicly from Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4707.06s)]
*  it is very clear how dependent Israel really is on the United States, primarily for its military [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4711.860000000001s)]
*  support. That has become abundantly clear over the past year. And, Adav, you have been highly [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4718.820000000001s)]
*  critical of the U.S. response and their posturing leading up to this unprecedented now second [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4723.38s)]
*  attack from Iran against Israel. Explain why. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4730.58s)]
*  Well, we have heard Secretary Austin saying in the last 48 hours that there will be serious [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4735.62s)]
*  consequences, Vienna, if Israel would be attacked by Iran. But we didn't see the White House as [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4741.9400000000005s)]
*  vigilant about this, as resolved about this as the White House can be. And, you know, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4750.26s)]
*  Israelis and the Israeli defense apparatus is highly appreciative of the way that President Biden [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4755.62s)]
*  has been supportive of Israel and the way that he at the beginning of the war said don't to Hizballah, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4760.74s)]
*  and he meant Hizballah joining the fight with Hamas not only by shooting missiles and rockets, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4767.62s)]
*  but also by maybe invading to Israel. And we didn't see this quick action coming from the White [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4773.62s)]
*  House. It's true that Secretary Austin did say that, but Iranians have been threatening since [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4780.18s)]
*  the Nasrallah hit that they'll respond. And the White House was relatively, I don't want to say, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4787.38s)]
*  silent because the president did say that the United States will assist Israel defensively. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4793.7s)]
*  But there is a change of tone, and it's more than a tone. If the United States is saying, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4799.22s)]
*  we're going to assist Israel with its defense, it's one thing. If they're going to say, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4804.26s)]
*  Iran is going to face serious consequences as a result of this, that means either diplomatic [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4809.22s)]
*  consequences, right, or maybe the United States thinking of actually assisting Israel with its [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4815.54s)]
*  own response, something that my colleague Barak Ravi alluded to. So whether or not this is the [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4821.9400000000005s)]
*  case, it was for the White House to say this before the attack. And I don't mean two hours [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4827.3s)]
*  before the attack like they did, but a couple of days before. And they knew how to do that, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4833.78s)]
*  both with the Hizballah conflict before and, of course, with the best example of their policy [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4838.58s)]
*  vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia at the time. And, Adav, are you echoing views and sentiments shared [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4844.74s)]
*  by others in the Israeli defense establishment and security? [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4850.66s)]
*  Yes, I think that the Israelis, first of all, in the defense are really very appreciative of the [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4857.54s)]
*  United States. They understand that without the U.S., without the U.S. support, without [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4862.5s)]
*  ammunition coming from the U.S. and without intelligence support and SIGINT support, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4867.86s)]
*  the ability of Israel to block most of this attack by Iran would be rather limited. So they're not [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4873.62s)]
*  going to be critical of the U.S. on the record, but they would want to see a policy of the United [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4880.1s)]
*  States that would be much more deterrent towards Iran. And they think this is lacking. And by the [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4886.900000000001s)]
*  way, to be frank, they don't think that it began with this administration. There is a lack of [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4892.26s)]
*  strategy or strategic clearance in the way that the U.S. is conducting itself in the region [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4898.26s)]
*  towards the Iranian spheres of influence. And Iran is a bad actor. There is an understanding in [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4904.42s)]
*  D.C. that Iran is a bad actor. But the problem mainly is of application of a real strategy. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4909.06s)]
*  And this is something I'm hearing from my Saudi sources, my Jordanian sources, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4915.860000000001s)]
*  my UAE sources, and also from the Israelis. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4920.660000000001s)]
*  Beth, as someone who has been part of a national security team in the U.S. government, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4923.780000000001s)]
*  what is your reaction to what you're hearing from Nadav? Do you agree with his assessment or not? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4929.06s)]
*  But I absolutely agree, especially with this last point. I don't agree with everything because [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4936.02s)]
*  I'm looking at this from an American perspective. But absolutely, U.S. policy toward the region [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4940.900000000001s)]
*  has not been consistent and has not been standing up to deterrence. When the Iranians attacked [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4948.9800000000005s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco facilities in 2019, whatever it was, 18, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4955.54s)]
*  um, President Trump did not respond, breaking four decades of an agreement, basically, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4962.74s)]
*  that we would come to the defense of Saudi's oil industry because it affects global supply [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4970.1s)]
*  and prices. And that is what was the, you know, the deal. And so, you know, this is, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4977.14s)]
*  this is something that you will hear from every Gulf leader about the lack of U.S. consistency. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4984.0199999999995s)]
*  But here is the deal right now. We have interests that align with Israel, but we also have broader [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4991.3s)]
*  global interests. And we are, you know, are we going to spend all of our efforts on just the [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=4999.22s)]
*  Middle East when we have to worry about China? These are the kinds of things that have to be [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5007.78s)]
*  discussed. And absolutely, you will not find this administration or the next, no matter who it is, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5012.34s)]
*  abandoning Israel. But we have to think about the balance in a way that Israel doesn't and won't. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5019.14s)]
*  Yeah. And General Hurtling, Beth mentioned China, but let's talk about Russia [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5025.38s)]
*  and the closer ties Russia has developed with Iran since its war against Ukraine now. And there are [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5029.94s)]
*  real concerns among those in the Biden administration as it relates to the war in Ukraine [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5038.42s)]
*  in terms of how Russia could escalate and not necessarily on the nuclear front in Ukraine, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5044.66s)]
*  but what they could do to hurt U.S. interests, particularly in the Middle East now. So can you [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5051.78s)]
*  sort of tie that together for us, the point that Beth has been making from a military perspective? [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5058.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, I'd address the policy issue first, Biana, if I may. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5064.82s)]
*  Having contacts with a lot of individuals in the Middle Eastern region, too, I know that there are [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5069.22s)]
*  a lot of thoughts about what U.S. policy should do. And it's usually from the perspective of the [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5074.34s)]
*  state that's talking about it. It doesn't consider the requirements of the United States in terms of [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5079.860000000001s)]
*  its values and its vision and its approach to world governments, as you just pointed out and [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5085.3s)]
*  as Beth just pointed out. There is a lot more in this equation than just singularly addressing Iran [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5090.18s)]
*  in the Middle East. There is the requirement to balance the approach toward all the Middle [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5097.54s)]
*  Eastern nations, as well as, as you just said, the connections between some of these foes and [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5102.42s)]
*  competitors like Iran, like Russia, like North Korea, like China that are all involved in some [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5107.3s)]
*  of these terrorist activities and attacking the sovereignty of other nations. And I think that's [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5114.26s)]
*  what it goes back to in terms of the existential threat of places like Israel and like Ukraine and [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5119.78s)]
*  South Korea. And, you know, I mean, we could go on and on, but that's a balancing act. And just [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5127.86s)]
*  because we're not pleasing some people in parts of the world doesn't mean our strategy is off. It [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5133.46s)]
*  has to do with how do you build a strategy toward balancing your approach and making sure that all [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5138.74s)]
*  things are considered in dealing with other nations? It just seems to me a lot of people [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5144.5s)]
*  repeatedly say that the U.S. is getting it wrong because we're not doing what other nations want [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5149.7s)]
*  us to do. Nadeau, quickly, do you have a response to that? I don't know of any government in the [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5154.9s)]
*  region that understands clearly what's the U.S. strategy towards the region vis-a-vis Iran in [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5162.339999999999s)]
*  terms of limiting it. It's sure that the U.S. wants to have more Abraham Accords. It wants to [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5168.339999999999s)]
*  have normalization with Saudi Arabia. It wants to support its allies. But how do you tackle this [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5174.099999999999s)]
*  kind of actor that supports proxies around the region and tries to derail any process, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5180.34s)]
*  positive process in the region? What do you do? I think it's a serious question. And again, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5186.18s)]
*  I'm not addressing this to any specific administration. I think it's a crisis in [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5190.18s)]
*  the last decade. And I think it needs addressing. Yeah. And again, I think it has been addressed [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5194.18s)]
*  in the national security strategy of the United States. It addresses the proxies in the region, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5200.26s)]
*  what we like to do to tamp them down and to prevent a more regional conflict between the [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5205.78s)]
*  United States and Iran, which could contribute potentially to a global conflict when we talk [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5211.219999999999s)]
*  about the Russian interference in Ukraine as well as China's actions. Yeah. There seem to be [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5216.34s)]
*  different strategies here. The U.S. has always opted, it appears, or at least as of late, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5222.179999999999s)]
*  of one of de-escalation and Israel over the course of the last year, but many years, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5226.74s)]
*  has been saying that that strategy just does not work for them. Everyone, thank you so much. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5231.860000000001s)]
*  Next, we're going to turn to the latest from the White House and the Pentagon as our CNN.com [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5237.7s)]
*  coverage continues. Are they hearing us? Control, do you guys hear? [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5242.820000000001s)]
*  He is the smartest son of the b****s who have ever done this for a living. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5252.820000000001s)]
*  He's the economy, stupid. I ain't apologizing to no one. The man is a two-fisted c******t. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5255.86s)]
*  I am saying publicly what people are saying themselves. I have enough money. I could just [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5270.9s)]
*  shut up. Carb, winning is everything, stupid. Saturday, October 5th on CNN. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5276.339999999999s)]
*  What does it mean to be out front? It's going there. We are just about three miles from the [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5282.66s)]
*  Gaza border. It's finding out something unexpected. I relish all of our conversations. It's context. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5287.94s)]
*  The economy is by far the top issue for Americans in this election. Curiosity. Does someone else [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5294.099999999999s)]
*  need to jump in the race? And above all, it's about sharing that so you can be out front too. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5299.62s)]
*  Let's go out front. Aaron Burnett, Out Front, on CNN. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5305.86s)]
*  It was a different time, both on television and off television. Ellen put her entire career [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5312.5s)]
*  at stake. She could have lost everything. Ellen's coming out episode suddenly says to the world, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5319.78s)]
*  hey, it's okay to be gay. Everyone was talking about it. It was a national event. I don't think [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5326.26s)]
*  I realized how much it meant to the community until I saw people watching the episode. TV on the edge, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5330.66s)]
*  moments that shaped our culture. Sunday at nine on CNN. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5337.38s)]
*  You. Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5367.38s)]
*  With you. The source with Caitlin Collins. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5397.9400000000005s)]
*  Good evening, everyone. I'm Abby Phillip. What on earth is going on with the Republican party? [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5402.34s)]
*  Isn't this just a huge problem for the Biden campaign? How do you know that those numbers [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5407.38s)]
*  are false? News night with Abby Phillip on CNN. When you saw this guilty plea, were you surprised? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5412.26s)]
*  Do you think the criticism has been fair? The Supreme Court might take us up. What's the outcome, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5420.58s)]
*  though? How's that for a cliffhanger America? Laura Coats live on CNN. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5425.3s)]
*  Now before the break, we touched on American military capabilities in the region. Earlier [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5433.7s)]
*  today, a Pentagon spokesman says Navy destroyers fired about a dozen interceptors at incoming [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5438.900000000001s)]
*  Iranian missiles. He also detailed Defense Secretary Austin's conversation today with [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5443.62s)]
*  his Israeli counterpart. To be crystal clear, as Secretary Austin has said, should Iran [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5448.34s)]
*  partners or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5455.7s)]
*  the United States will take every necessary measure to defend our people. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5461.22s)]
*  More now from CNN's Kayla Toshi at the White House, CNN's Orrin Lieberman at the Pentagon. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5466.74s)]
*  Kayla, President Biden said that it was, quote, active discussion on how Israel [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5470.9800000000005s)]
*  should respond to this attack from Iran. He went on to say that he fully supports Israel. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5475.38s)]
*  I don't believe that he has spoken yet with the prime minister. What more are you hearing? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5481.14s)]
*  Well, we know that this is a very live discussion, Bianna, both on how Israel plans to respond in [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5485.860000000001s)]
*  Iran and also whether the U.S. levies new consequences in the form of sanctions or [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5491.78s)]
*  otherwise against Iran. And we know that the U.S. and Israeli counterparts have been in very close [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5497.54s)]
*  contact, not just today, but for the last several weeks as Israel has ramped up its targeting of [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5503.14s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah leaders and also gone through these raids and incursions in Lebanon, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5507.9400000000005s)]
*  which are continuing. And so the U.S. and several officials stress that they are in close contact. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5514.9s)]
*  But as of this moment, it is not clear that there's been a decision that's been made. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5520.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his counterpart Yoel Gallant [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5524.58s)]
*  speak quite regularly. I believe they've spoken already twice today alone. Orrin, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5528.42s)]
*  more U.S.-based troops have now been put to prepare to deploy orders in the Middle East. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5533.78s)]
*  We also know that U.S. CENTCOM yesterday added three additional aircraft squadrons [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5539.299999999999s)]
*  to the region. There are two U.S. aircraft carriers there. What more are you learning [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5544.66s)]
*  about this buildup? So the U.S. knew or expected that there would be some sort of Iranian response. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5549.22s)]
*  They have effectively said this ever since the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's leader, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5555.139999999999s)]
*  in Tehran, that Iran was positioned, postured, and ready to carry out an attack. Yes, it took [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5559.22s)]
*  longer than the U.S. anticipated, but certainly after the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5564.18s)]
*  in Lebanon, it became clear that an attack was coming. That heads up was given much earlier today [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5568.9s)]
*  to the Israelis, warning them of an imminent attack. And then several hours later that came, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5573.7s)]
*  the U.S. and Israel coordinating on that response. And the U.S. clear that if needed, there are more [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5578.66s)]
*  forces that can head to the region, that prepare to deploy orders, is essentially a heads up to [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5584.099999999999s)]
*  troops that, hey, you may need to be going in 24, 48 hours to head over, of course, in all likelihood [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5588.26s)]
*  to the Middle East. The U.S. wouldn't say how many troops were put on those orders or what their [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5593.0599999999995s)]
*  roles are, but certainly we can speculate that it's air defenses that would be critical. And [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5597.7s)]
*  we saw the U.S. play a role in this defense against the Iranian attack. And there's a very [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5601.86s)]
*  real possibility here that the administration has been planning for the potential of needing to carry [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5606.339999999999s)]
*  out an evacuation from Lebanon. That evacuation hasn't been ordered yet, but it's been discussed [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5610.9s)]
*  and planned almost since the beginning of the war back in October. So all of these realities very [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5616.259999999999s)]
*  much facing the U.S. and facing Israel as well, as you see the coordination certainly in intercepting [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5621.7s)]
*  an attack like the one we saw tonight. Yeah. And Kayla Orrin mentioned the operation there in Lebanon, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5626.9s)]
*  Israel for the first time in nearly 20 years, going in for what they are calling a precise and [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5633.139999999999s)]
*  limited ground operation into Lebanon. The concern, obviously, is that this can escalate and they could [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5639.62s)]
*  spend much longer and go further into the country. What are your sources saying about how the White [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5645.7s)]
*  House is viewing all of this? Well, that description that you just mentioned is very important because [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5651.78s)]
*  to the White House, the parameters of any operation in Lebanon matter deeply to the [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5657.54s)]
*  administration. President Biden earlier this week, when asked about whether he was aware of the [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5662.34s)]
*  operations in Lebanon, told a reporter, I'm more aware than you know, and asked if he was comfortable. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5667.139999999999s)]
*  He said, I'm comfortable with them stopping. Now, those comments took many by surprise because of [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5672.099999999999s)]
*  this constant contact that we've been discussing throughout this conversation. But I'm told that [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5678.42s)]
*  the U.S. supports an operation on a limited, on a targeted, on a precise basis. And then anything [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5684.02s)]
*  wider than that would be a cause for concern. Yeah. And Orrin, the Pentagon has been preparing [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5690.74s)]
*  for an escalation like today's attack from Iran for months now. Obviously, we saw that initial [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5695.54s)]
*  unprecedented attack back in April. The U.S. calling this a defeat for Iran and describing [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5702.82s)]
*  it as ineffective. I understand the point they're trying to make, but that's not what the feeling [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5709.7s)]
*  was as we were watching this play out in real time. Two hundred, nearly two hundred ballistic missiles [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5714.98s)]
*  coming in towards Tel Aviv specifically. The attack we saw back in April on April 13th and [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5721.299999999999s)]
*  the attack we saw tonight, they are substantively different attacks. In April, there was effectively [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5727.86s)]
*  quite a large heads up given to the U.S. and to others by Iran through back channels that [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5733.219999999999s)]
*  it was coming. There was time, therefore, to set up and prepare air defenses to make sure the vast [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5737.219999999999s)]
*  majority was shot down. In effect, the April attack was trying to send a message and trying to at [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5741.86s)]
*  least show video of some sort of victory. This attack, at least in terms of the numbers of [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5747.38s)]
*  ballistic missiles, was nearly twice as large, something like 180 or more powerful ballistic [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5751.94s)]
*  missiles. This attack, as the Pentagon pointed out, was meant to cause damage. So it didn't just [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5757.38s)]
*  look or feel differently. It was a much different, much larger attack. It appears aimed at Israeli [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5762.34s)]
*  air bases as well as Israeli intelligence headquarters that are essentially located in [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5768.26s)]
*  the country fairly close to the population centers there. So you saw that coming from the Pentagon, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5774.82s)]
*  the warning that there will be a response here, that coming from National Security Advisor Jake [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5780.26s)]
*  Sullivan and the State Department as well. How that response looks, that's something the U.S. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5785.06s)]
*  very much wants to talk to Israel about. The question, of course, when and very much what's [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5790.02s)]
*  targeted in that response and what role, if any, does the U.S. play as Israel has vowed to respond? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5794.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, Latashi, Orrin Lieberman, thank you. Joining us for more on how the U.S. may respond, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5799.9400000000005s)]
*  Congressman Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. Congressman, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5805.14s)]
*  what role do you expect the U.S. will play in Israel's response to this attack? [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5809.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think we need to set expectations at a reasonable place. The U.S. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5816.02s)]
*  is not in control of this conflict. I heard some of the comments from your earlier guests about, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5820.660000000001s)]
*  what's the plan? How do we stop Iran? As if we have some magic answer. We don't control the region. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5824.820000000001s)]
*  We do support Israel's ability to defend itself and will continue to do so. That's why we've [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5830.9800000000005s)]
*  helped supply them with arms. We were working with them in a variety of different ways. We see the [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5836.580000000001s)]
*  threat from Iran through Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, a variety of different other [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5840.98s)]
*  Shia militias across Iraq and Syria. Iran is the principal driver of conflict in the region, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5846.66s)]
*  and we're going to work with Israel and other partners in the region to try and deter them. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5852.5s)]
*  At the same time, President Biden is going to continue to work to try to get a ceasefire in [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5856.66s)]
*  Gaza and to get an understanding between Israel and Lebanon that can stop that fighting. But this [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5861.459999999999s)]
*  is pretty straightforward. Hezbollah and Lebanon have been lobbing missiles into Israel for almost [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5866.18s)]
*  a year now. Israel cannot continue to tolerate that, and that's the reason they've struck back [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5870.820000000001s)]
*  so hard against Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies. So when you hear the administration, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5875.860000000001s)]
*  because up until today's unprecedented attack from Iran directly on Israel with nearly 200 [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5882.42s)]
*  ballistic missiles, the message from the U.S. has been one of de-escalation, of a ceasefire, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5888.42s)]
*  and do you think that was the right message, given what you just laid out? This has been ongoing, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5895.7s)]
*  Hezbollah lobbing missiles into Israel unprompted since October 8th. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5902.58s)]
*  Yeah. Well, there's a fundamental misunderstanding of what you just said. The message from the U.S. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5909.54s)]
*  hasn't been, oh, Israel, please stop. OK, it hasn't been unilaterally shut down. It has been get to [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5914.9s)]
*  de-escalation. But the only way to get to de-escalation is what I said a moment ago, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5922.42s)]
*  is to get Hezbollah and Lebanon to stop attacking Israel. That is what the Biden [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5927.46s)]
*  administration has been pushing for. They haven't been telling Israel, oh, don't respond, just let [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5932.74s)]
*  it happen. In fact, you've seen in two attacks now from Iran, we've helped Israel defend against [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5937.38s)]
*  those attacks. So it's not the point that it's like, oh, please de-escalate, just stop fighting [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5943.22s)]
*  for the sake of stopping it. It's working with all of the different partners. Even in Gaza, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5948.5s)]
*  we're trying to get a ceasefire to get the hostages returned. OK, we're trying to get the [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5953.22s)]
*  peace agreement, or sorry, ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel to stop Israel from being attacked. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5957.46s)]
*  It's not a unilateral thing that the administration is advocating for. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5964.26s)]
*  Do you see, because as we know recently, Israel in a war cabinet added to its goals the return [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5969.06s)]
*  of some 60,000-plus residents to the north of Israel. They've been displaced now [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5975.94s)]
*  for nearly a year. Do you see the strategy that Israel seems to be playing out now, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5981.0599999999995s)]
*  going after Hezbollah as aggressively as it has, and now what we're expecting to be a massive [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5987.7s)]
*  response to Iran's attack today, do you see Israel any time soon getting closer to that goal of [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=5993.219999999999s)]
*  bringing those residents home? Yeah. I think there's an opportunity right now, because Hezbollah [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6000.66s)]
*  has been crippled, at least in the short term. And there is an incredible opportunity right now [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6005.86s)]
*  for the Lebanese people to choose a different path, to work with others in Lebanon to try to [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6011.54s)]
*  get a governing structure that isn't ruled by Hezbollah and their hatred for Israel. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6017.78s)]
*  I think there is a real opportunity right now for the Lebanese government and other actors in [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6023.219999999999s)]
*  Lebanon, Sunnis, Maronite Christians, the Druze, even some Shia who don't want to be ruled by the [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6029.38s)]
*  warfare of Hezbollah, to choose a different path. So yes, I think there is a window right now and [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6035.86s)]
*  an opportunity to work with Lebanon while Hezbollah is weakened to choose a more peaceful path. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6040.82s)]
*  Are you willing to see the United States step up its role in defense of Israel, not only [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6048.099999999999s)]
*  defending it from attacks from adversaries like Iran, but also perhaps playing a more proactive? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6056.82s)]
*  role in engaging directly militarily? No, I do not think that is wise. And I heard the earlier [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6065.78s)]
*  commentary about what to do about Iran and what is the US policy. Well, the US policy is not really [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6074.0199999999995s)]
*  that confusing. We want to try to contain and deter Iran. We don't want to go to war with them. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6079.54s)]
*  Okay. It's a clear and simple message. It's just extraordinarily difficult to achieve. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6083.7s)]
*  Everyone assumes that we have some magic card that we could play that would instantly deter Iran. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6089.94s)]
*  As if we attacked them militarily, that would prove successful. That would be an incredibly [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6095.54s)]
*  dangerous step that could possibly inflame the region and who knows how it would come out. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6101.46s)]
*  So what we're trying to do is find ways to contain and deter them without engaging in that type of [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6106.26s)]
*  open warfare. Much of the Middle East does not want to see US troops on the ground in it, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6111.46s)]
*  not just Iran. So that's the balance we have to try to strike. Key to that is partners, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6117.62s)]
*  certainly Israel, but also Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the UAE. That's what was so important, what is so [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6122.9s)]
*  important about the Abraham Accords, is getting to some sort of peace between Israel and these other [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6128.74s)]
*  Arab states to deter Iran. But the key to that is a future for the Palestinians. And as strongly as [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6134.339999999999s)]
*  I support Israel, one big area of disagreement, what Israel is doing in the West Bank and what [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6141.78s)]
*  Israel is failing to do by helping the Palestinians develop an alternative to Hamas [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6147.3s)]
*  is undermining that ability to get that peace agreement with Saudi Arabia and the UAE and others [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6152.58s)]
*  to deter Iran. This is what you're talking about. Well, we've discussed earlier about what a day [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6159.06s)]
*  after strategy may look like, and that's not limited to just Gaza, but now it's also impacting [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6163.22s)]
*  Lebanon and perhaps even Iran, given how quickly things are escalating. Congressman Adam Smith, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6168.820000000001s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for giving me the chance. Back now to Mark Hartling [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6176.02s)]
*  and Beth Sanner. Beth, your response to what we just heard from the congressman? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6182.34s)]
*  I think that Congressman Smith is very wise and also a great communicator. And he makes some [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6188.660000000001s)]
*  really great points about what our strategy has been. But I do think that there are major [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6197.54s)]
*  shortcomings there in terms of consistency and follow through in terms of what we're trying to [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6205.78s)]
*  achieve and simply containing Iran is not working. And so containing the Houthis is not working. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6213.22s)]
*  And we're expending literally billions of dollars, billions of dollars shooting down missiles. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6224.1s)]
*  But our rules of engagement prevent us from actually striking the Houthis directly or holding [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6231.860000000001s)]
*  Iran accountable. And so I do think that, you know, the current policy is not necessarily [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6237.780000000001s)]
*  sustainable for as long as it may last. And that kind of contingency has to be worked into the [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6244.42s)]
*  process. There are no silver bullets and there are no easy answers though. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6251.54s)]
*  No, there aren't. In general, militarily speaking, this has been quite a win, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6256.1s)]
*  not only for Israel in showing the strength of its air defense systems, but also the United States [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6261.54s)]
*  participating in that. U.S. Navy destroyers, they say, fired approximately a dozen interceptors. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6266.820000000001s)]
*  But on the issue of policy, do you think that is now perhaps a time to reevaluate U.S. policy [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6272.98s)]
*  in the region, especially vis-a-vis Iran, which most everyone agrees really is the center [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6282.339999999999s)]
*  of all of the discord now and instability in the region? [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6290.98s)]
*  There's been several approaches to Iran over the last decade, Diana, as we all know. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6297.219999999999s)]
*  And I'd like to, I would, I'm not a policy maker. I'm a policy executor as a soldier, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6301.94s)]
*  or at least I was at one point. But what I would suggest is containment sounds like a pretty good [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6307.379999999999s)]
*  policy to me if it works right. Unfortunately, as Congressman Smith said, you can't have a silver [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6313.299999999999s)]
*  bullet. You can't wave a magic wand and make other countries do what you want them to do. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6319.219999999999s)]
*  And I'm not a big believer in the heavy stick in some of these countries because it does get you [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6324.34s)]
*  into regional conflicts. And in the Middle East, that's not a good thing, especially when you've [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6332.82s)]
*  got Iran spread out over various nations with their proxy forces. One of the things I think [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6337.38s)]
*  this conflict has done is the Hamas fighters have been gradually decimated in Gaza. Hezbollah has [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6343.46s)]
*  been harmed with both its command and control elements and many of its rocket launcher systems [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6352.18s)]
*  and missile launcher system in Lebanon. There's still a lot to be done by Israel. We're talking [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6358.42s)]
*  about the Houthis that have been fighting a major power, Saudi Arabia, for the last six or seven [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6363.54s)]
*  years. And you're talking about a lot of nations, as Congressman Smith said, that are countering [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6368.900000000001s)]
*  Iranian malign influence. But it's something that's very difficult to stop when they have proxies [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6376.660000000001s)]
*  in Syria, in Iraq, in Yemen, in Lebanon, in a variety of places that are all countering [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6382.740000000001s)]
*  the potential for getting at those malign influences. The policy is to contain [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6389.9400000000005s)]
*  Iran. That's in the national security policy. That changed during various administrations. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6396.1s)]
*  That's just unfortunately the way national security policy is written. Strategies are written by [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6402.099999999999s)]
*  different administrations. When you have continuous change, you're going to have some changes in their [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6408.58s)]
*  strategies. But in the case of Iran, in my view, my personal opinion, the best way to contain them [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6413.54s)]
*  is to go after their proxies and try and counter them with good government in other states in the [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6420.66s)]
*  area. What are Iran's military capabilities themselves? They've invested tremendous [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6427.54s)]
*  amount of money in their proxies over the past few decades with the aim of exhausting [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6434.5s)]
*  their enemies, namely Israel. Now we see that Hezbollah has been severely crippled, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6440.26s)]
*  as has Hamas as well. What does that expose about any potential vulnerabilities militarily for Iran? [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6448.0199999999995s)]
*  That is a key question, Breonna. And I think it's part of the strategy. When you expose Iran for [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6453.86s)]
*  what it can and cannot do, what we saw today is what it can do. They don't have a whole lot of [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6461.7s)]
*  military strength in other areas. They don't have a very good standing army. They have the Quds Force. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6467.54s)]
*  They don't have a great air force. Their aircraft are over 70 years old. They're still flying F-4 [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6473.139999999999s)]
*  Phantoms like we used to fly in Vietnam. They don't have a very good Navy. They have enough [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6478.82s)]
*  to harass shipping in the Persian Gulf. But beyond that, they're not a solid military. So they use [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6483.3s)]
*  their proxies, Hezbollah, the PMF forces in Syria and Iraq, Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen. Those are [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6489.38s)]
*  their forward lines of defenses, and that's what they use so that those organizations can be defeated [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6498.42s)]
*  and eventually destroyed, which is what Israel's attempting to do. You have a very good method of [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6504.18s)]
*  exposing Iran for the lack of military prowess, which they don't have. And they now appear to be [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6509.62s)]
*  especially vulnerable with the new government and obviously economically crippled as well. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6514.9800000000005s)]
*  General Hurtling, Beth Saner, thank you. And we'll come back to you for some final thoughts in just a [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6520.820000000001s)]
*  moment, but more now on Israel's ongoing operation in Lebanon. For that, let's go back to CNN's [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6526.5s)]
*  Jamana Karachi. Jamana, the Lebanese Health Ministry, announced 55 people were killed in [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6531.86s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes over the past 24 hours. It was just yesterday that Israeli ground forces started [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6536.66s)]
*  their incursion into southern Lebanon. That was the major headline and story we were focusing on. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6542.0199999999995s)]
*  Wow, how quickly things have escalated over the course of just 24 hours. But what is the mood [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6548.339999999999s)]
*  there where you are in Beirut right now? Well, you know, Brianna, it's about four, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6553.38s)]
*  Brianna, it's four o'clock in the morning. And people here have been woken up by the sounds [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6562.1s)]
*  of explosions. This coming after the Israeli military's Arabic language spokesman began [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6567.7s)]
*  posting these warnings on X, several warnings over the last past four hours. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6575.14s)]
*  These are evacuation orders for some neighborhoods of the southern suburbs. Of course, this is an [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6585.54s)]
*  area where you've had a heavy presence of Hezbollah, where its leadership was based, but it is also home [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6590.26s)]
*  to many, many civilians. It was one of the most densely populated parts of the country, but we [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6598.5s)]
*  have seen a mass exodus from there in recent days as the airstrikes have intensified. But you still [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6603.7s)]
*  have civilians in the southern suburbs. And so you had these evacuation orders coming out. And we [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6611.38s)]
*  hear our team, we've heard several blasts not far from here where the southern suburbs are. And you [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6618.58s)]
*  could see thick plumes of smoke rising. It's unclear right now what is targeted, but the Israeli [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6625.7s)]
*  military said that it's going to be targeting Hezbollah facilities and weapons storage facilities [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6631.22s)]
*  in those areas. And just keeping in mind, this happening at a time when most people here are [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6638.34s)]
*  sleeping, really highly unlikely that they would have been seeing these posts on social media at [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6644.9800000000005s)]
*  that time. And today it's been cold, it's been raining, it's been windy, and you've got so many [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6653.06s)]
*  people who are already out on the streets because there's not enough shelter for up to a million [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6659.62s)]
*  people who've already been displaced. And you have this dire humanitarian situation that seems to be [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6663.94s)]
*  worsening by the day. And we've had airstrikes as well continuing in southern Lebanon, where as you [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6671.46s)]
*  mentioned, there's that, what the Israeli military announced as this limited ground operation that [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6677.86s)]
*  began yesterday. But our understanding, according to our sources, Biana, is that this is [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6685.06s)]
*  our Lebanese sources here and another security source as well telling us that what they have [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6691.9400000000005s)]
*  seen is these raids across the border, but no boots on the ground. Israeli forces have not [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6696.26s)]
*  remained here and they've not seen signs of a full military invasion of southern Lebanon. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6702.1s)]
*  We'll see if any of that changes over the course of the next days and weeks. Jamana Karachi, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6708.5s)]
*  thank you so much. Please get some rest. It has been a very long day for you, I know. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6713.7s)]
*  I'm joined now by retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton, a former member of the Joint Chiefs of [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6718.179999999999s)]
*  Staff. Back with us, retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hartling. Colonel Leighton, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6722.82s)]
*  a weapons analyst who analyzed videos from today's attack for CNN thinks variants of [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6727.86s)]
*  the Iranian Shahab 3 series ballistic missiles were used. What more can you tell us about these [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6732.82s)]
*  specific missiles? Yeah, Biana, the Shahab 3 is one of the Iranian missiles that is used for [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6738.9s)]
*  a kind of a mid-distance to long-distance attack and what it can be done, what can be used for [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6745.139999999999s)]
*  is basically targeting some areas in places as far away as Israel. So we're talking about [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6753.219999999999s)]
*  a thousand kilometers or so from Iran itself and that is the basically a two-stage missile that [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6759.299999999999s)]
*  allows the Iranians to use the kind of propellant that they need in order to get that distance. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6766.58s)]
*  And when they do that, they then increase the types of targets that they can hit and that's [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6773.86s)]
*  distinct, it's distinctly possible that the Shahab 3 was actually used in tonight's attack. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6780.42s)]
*  General, how, if at all, has Iran adapted from their first attack on Israel back in April? A [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6786.5s)]
*  reminder, they launched some 300 projectiles that included drones and cruise missiles [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6793.3s)]
*  saw, I believe, ballistic missiles. Yeah, it was an interesting adaptation, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6801.38s)]
*  Biana, and first of all, I want to say I agree with Cedric. He's spot on in terms of this analysis [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6808.02s)]
*  and there was the potential for Iran to use a Fata missile which has a much greater range and [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6814.34s)]
*  greater capability and I'm not sure that'll come up in terms of the analysis. But in terms of the [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6820.1s)]
*  difference between the two strikes, you know, in the first one back in April, Iran threw everything [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6825.06s)]
*  they could in a very uncoordinated and unsynchronized attack against Israel. And when they did that with [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6829.620000000001s)]
*  the help from a lot of Western forces, all of them were able to be easily shot down with some good [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6837.46s)]
*  skill, Western trained and Israeli trained pilots and air defenders. This one, when you're talking [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6844.42s)]
*  about 180 ballistic missiles and that's just a portion, a small fraction of the ballistic missile [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6849.86s)]
*  force that Iran has, you're bordering on an overmatch capability with Israeli air defense [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6857.299999999999s)]
*  and I think we were right on the edge of that today. You know, if there had been a lot more, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6863.62s)]
*  say even a hundred more missiles shot, you know, it may have overwhelmed some of the [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6868.5s)]
*  Israeli air defense systems even with the help of the U.S. carriers and their destroyers and [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6874.42s)]
*  cruisers which have air defense capabilities. So yeah, it's tough. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6881.46s)]
*  Yeah, and I was going to say Colonel Layton, it's also quite notable and to Israel's great [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6887.54s)]
*  benefit that Hezbollah didn't join into the fray today. Perhaps they don't have the access [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6894.1s)]
*  to the weapons that Israel has now been decimating over the past few weeks before [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6901.7s)]
*  they've started these precise limited ground incursions. They've just been doing aerial attacks. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6907.62s)]
*  But do you think to General Hurtling's point, if Hezbollah had also joined the fray here, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6913.86s)]
*  that Israel's air defense systems would have just been overwhelmed? [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6919.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think absolutely. I think General Hurtling's spot on because one of the things [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6923.46s)]
*  that you have to always look at when you set up an air defense system or an integrated air defense [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6927.46s)]
*  system, as we like to call it in the business, that is something that really has a limitation. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6931.62s)]
*  No matter how you set it up, no matter how many radars you have, no matter how many interceptors [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6937.46s)]
*  you have, there's always some kind of a limit that can saturate the system. So if they had been able, [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6942.42s)]
*  if Hezbollah had been able to access its armaments and the ones that they're either storing for [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6948.58s)]
*  themselves or storing for Iran in Lebanon, that could have presented a challenge not only in terms [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6954.02s)]
*  of numbers but also in terms of the distance that they're flying, a much shorter distance from Lebanon [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6959.9400000000005s)]
*  to Israel as opposed from Iran to Israel. Yeah, no doubt. Just over the border there with each other. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6968.18s)]
*  General Hurtling, Colonel Layton, thank you so much. Our coverage of Iran's missile [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=6972.740000000001s)]

*  Welcome back to our special continuing coverage of Iran's attack on Israel. I'm Bianna Goledriga. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7158.82s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sending a clear message to Iran. He's [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7181.86s)]
*  vowing to retaliate for the barrage of missiles it fired on Israel today. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7186.58s)]
*  Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7194.9s)]
*  our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7200.98s)]
*  We will stand by the rule we established. Whoever attacks us, we will attack him. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7207.62s)]
*  So the question now is when will Israel respond and what will it look like? [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7213.38s)]
*  Each escalation between Israel, Iran, and Iran's proxies have sparked concerns that a full-blown [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7219.06s)]
*  regional war could erupt. Iran's firing of about 200 ballistic missiles is no exception. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7224.580000000001s)]
*  This video shows Iranian missiles striking an air base in southern Israel. It's still unclear [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7243.14s)]
*  what exactly was hit. Iran says that it was targeting Israeli security and military targets [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7249.620000000001s)]

*  in Tel Aviv. Israel had launched a ground incursion into southern Lebanon just hours [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7266.18s)]
*  before this bombardment and tonight the IDF is striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon's [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7271.3s)]
*  capital of Beirut. President Biden remains as supportful, fully supportive of Israel. We're [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7276.820000000001s)]
*  told that he's in active discussions with the Israeli government about its impending response [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7283.54s)]
*  and U.S. Navy destroyers in the region helped intercept some of those Iranian missiles. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7289.22s)]
*  Vice President Harris says that she backs Biden's decision to shoot them down [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7294.1s)]
*  and reiterated her support for the Jewish state. And moments ago, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7298.58s)]
*  the attack on Israel was brought up during the vice presidential debate between Tim Walz and [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7302.5s)]
*  JD Vance. The expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7307.14s)]
*  States to have the steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today where along with our [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7315.22s)]
*  Israeli partners and our coalition able to stop the incoming attack. But what's fundamental here [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7320.18s)]
*  is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear and the world saw it on that debate [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7326.26s)]
*  stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80 year old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7331.22s)]
*  in this moment. But it's not just that. It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7337.54s)]
*  how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. As much as Governor Walz just accused [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7343.46s)]
*  Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7347.780000000001s)]
*  and he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7352.5s)]
*  Iran, which launched this attack, has received over a hundred billion dollars in unfrozen assets [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7358.34s)]
*  thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7364.18s)]
*  weapons that they're now launching against our allies and God forbid potentially launching [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7368.34s)]
*  against the United States as well. CNN is on the ground in the region tonight. I want to bring in [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7372.74s)]
*  CNN International anchor Becky Anderson in Tel Aviv for us. Becky, Israel is vowing revenge. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7378.58s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu telling his security cabinet that Iran made a big mistake tonight and [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7384.58s)]
*  it will pay for it. The question now is what that response, what that retaliation from Israel will [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7389.54s)]
*  look like. You're absolutely right. It is not clear what that retaliation might look like, but it's [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7395.94s)]
*  certainly clear from the words of the Prime Minister here that there will be some retaliation. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7404.9s)]
*  Let me step back and take you back to 7.30 p.m. October the first Tuesday. That is a night that [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7411.379999999999s)]
*  the people of Israel will not forget, not least the people of Tel Aviv where I am, where the display [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7420.98s)]
*  as these missiles were intercepted was absolutely remarkable and terrifying. Some nearly 200, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7429.54s)]
*  as we understand it, medium-range ballistic missiles fired from Iran, very specifically [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7438.74s)]
*  at targets of security and military infrastructure here over Israel. And what we understand is, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7445.86s)]
*  although there is no serious damage assessed as of yet, that assessment does go on and there is [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7454.42s)]
*  certainly damage at least one of the air bases set here just south of Tel Aviv and towards the [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7461.62s)]
*  Mossad intelligence headquarters, which are very close to where we are here in Tel Aviv. And the [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7470.18s)]
*  concern across the region here is palpable today, these hours. I've spoken to a number of sources [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7476.98s)]
*  across this region, not least those who are representing Arab leaders who had been pushing [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7484.58s)]
*  Iran very, very hard to restrain from any attack on Israel. After the death of Hassan Nasrallah, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7492.099999999999s)]
*  head of Hezbollah and Iran backed militant group, of course, operating out of Lebanon, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7502.42s)]
*  and since the incursion by Israel into southern Lebanon, albeit temporary and limited according [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7508.82s)]
*  to the Israelis, which started Tuesday morning in the wee hours. So what we can expect going forward [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7515.78s)]
*  is not clear, although around this region there are those who say you only had to listen [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7524.9s)]
*  to Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at the UN last week to understand where he stands. And if [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7530.820000000001s)]
*  the US and others around this region who have contacts with Israel had been able to an extent [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7539.46s)]
*  to restrain Benjamin Netanyahu from any direct attack on Iran until this point, it does seem now [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7547.14s)]
*  that the gloves are off. An unprecedented attack on Israel for which you would expect [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7555.78s)]
*  Israel to respond. Beanna? Unprecedented attack after unprecedented attack because that was the [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7563.0599999999995s)]
*  first time back in April that Iran had directly targeted Israel in that initial strike, and that [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7568.98s)]
*  was 300 projectiles. That included, yes, ballistic missiles, but mostly drones and other missiles, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7575.62s)]
*  cruise missiles that travel at a much slower pace. It's miraculous that there are only a [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7583.3s)]
*  few casualties thus far and one reported death given the limited time that civilians there had [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7588.82s)]
*  to seek shelter in their bomb shelters. Becky Anderson, stand by for us. I want to bring in [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7594.82s)]
*  CNN Senior White House correspondent Kayla Toschi, and Kayla, President Biden, said that he fully [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7599.94s)]
*  supports Israel. He has yet to speak with the prime minister and the administration describing [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7606.9s)]
*  this attack by Iran as defeated and ineffective. That's obviously given that it hasn't resulted [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7613.62s)]
*  in mass casualties, but the sheer size and scale of this attack is something that Israel clearly [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7621.139999999999s)]
*  has to respond to, the United States even acknowledging that. And the US has said that [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7629.219999999999s)]
*  there are those discussions going on right now to figure out what that response will look like and [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7634.1s)]
*  what, if any, input the Biden administration will have in that response. It's still unclear [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7639.620000000001s)]
*  that whether the Biden administration has a preference, for lack of a better word, [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7645.780000000001s)]
*  of how Israel responds, whether that would be taken into consideration. But largely in talking [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7652.42s)]
*  to officials today and hearing the administration's public pronouncements following the strikes, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7657.3s)]
*  they largely viewed it as a success. Here's how President Biden himself [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7662.18s)]
*  described it speaking from the Roosevelt Room with his cabinet. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7665.3s)]
*  Based on what we know now, the attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. And this is [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7669.860000000001s)]
*  testament to Israeli military capability and the US military. I'm also a testament to intensive [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7675.46s)]
*  planning between the United States and Israel to anticipate and defend against the brazen attack [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7681.860000000001s)]
*  we expected. Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully, fully supportive of Israel. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7688.1s)]
*  So there, President Biden describing it as defeating Iran and being an ineffective strike. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7695.54s)]
*  But, Bianna, it goes without saying that it would be the Biden administration's preference that [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7701.3s)]
*  the strike hadn't happened in the first place. Yeah, of course. And that leads to the question [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7704.740000000001s)]
*  of the United States believing at some point that perhaps the prospect of a potential strike [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7708.42s)]
*  by Iran had been thwarted. The US had been threatening that they wouldn't be able to [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7713.3s)]
*  restrain Israel if Iran struck Israel again. And the US had sent many more assets to the region [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7717.62s)]
*  as well. And yet we saw the decision that Iran chose to make. Yeah. And, but it was several weeks [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7724.660000000001s)]
*  of relative quiet before this strike did end up taking place, which was one of the reasons why [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7731.06s)]
*  there was a belief that perhaps one of these strikes or this potential retaliation could [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7736.58s)]
*  have been avoided. But because of the assassination of top Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh in late [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7742.74s)]
*  July, in the days just after that, the Pentagon began reinforcing the US military assets in the [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7751.7s)]
*  region, additional carriers, vessels, aircrafts in the region to support the US effort there. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7757.86s)]
*  That happened. And then a week after that, the White House essentially [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7764.42s)]
*  echoed Israeli intelligence suggesting that an Iranian attack was at that point imminent. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7768.34s)]
*  But that was in the middle of August and nearly six weeks transpired between then and now, [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7773.46s)]
*  which was one of the reasons why many had false confidence that perhaps this strike would not [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7778.5s)]
*  have happened. That being said, after Hassan Nasrallah was killed just last week in that [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7783.78s)]
*  attack in Beirut, in that strike in Beirut, there was the belief that in response to that, [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7791.860000000001s)]
*  that Iran would have no choice to retaliate. And that is why beginning early this week, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7796.82s)]
*  the US began receiving intelligence that such an attack was not only likely, but that was imminent. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7802.5s)]
*  One was discussed in the Oval Office among President Biden and his top aides on Monday. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7808.099999999999s)]
*  And then earlier this morning, with those aides discussing with Israel as well, giving them that [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7813.219999999999s)]
*  warning and then watching the attack unfold in the Situation Room. So it really happened [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7819.299999999999s)]
*  within a matter of days. But there is the belief that while there were many moments in the last [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7824.1s)]
*  several weeks, the last couple of months that would have seemed to incite this retaliation, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7829.620000000001s)]
*  that it was really the killing of the top Hezbollah leader in Beirut last Friday that was the catalyst [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7834.1s)]
*  for this specific action. Okay, Latoushi, thank you so much joining us from the White House or [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7843.06s)]
*  joining us from Washington. Well, with me now, David Hale, the former US ambassador to Lebanon, [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7848.660000000001s)]
*  Pakistan and Jordan, Hagar Himali, former National Security Council director, and Naria Kraus, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7853.14s)]
*  foreign policy and Middle East correspondent for Channel 13 in Israel. Hagar, let me start with you. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7859.38s)]
*  We've been here before. It's quite stunning that this is now the second time we are discussing a [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7866.58s)]
*  massive attack from Iran against Israel. 300 projectiles back in April, now some 200 ballistic [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7872.26s)]
*  missiles. How significant of a response are we expecting to see from Israel? [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7881.46s)]
*  Well, I would certainly expect Israel to respond and Prime Minister Netanyahu has promised to do [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7888.66s)]
*  so. And also, most importantly, you're seeing the prime minister become more risky with his moves [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7892.74s)]
*  over the last few weeks, more bold, more brazen. And so that said, just like in April, you have a [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7898.9s)]
*  very similar outcome. You have a very similar goal on the part of Iran. It looks pretty much [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7905.46s)]
*  like a saber rattling exercise to save face, to show Hezbollah that they're doing something. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7909.94s)]
*  But Iran does not appear like it wants to enter a full-scale direct escalation with Israel and by [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7916.58s)]
*  extension the United States. And that's because Israel at the end of the day, Iran at the end of [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7922.9s)]
*  the day is a state actor and they have much more to lose. And so they're happy to let their proxies [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7927.0599999999995s)]
*  do it for them. But that said, Israel does have to respond. And I expect something a bit stronger [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7930.5s)]
*  than the type of move they took after the event in April. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7936.58s)]
*  Niriya, what are you hearing from your sources in Israel about what that response may look like? [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7939.54s)]
*  And just walk us through how Israelis reacted to this incredible and frightening [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7945.38s)]
*  sight in the skies with missile after missile headed towards them. The majority of them [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7956.42s)]
*  were intercepted, but you had a situation where for at least an hour, the majority of the country [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7962.5s)]
*  was hiding in their bomb shelters. Yeah, yeah. Millions of Israelis today were sheltering [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7969.0599999999995s)]
*  when ballistic missiles are in the Israeli skies and the Air Force, the U.S. as well and other [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7978.98s)]
*  the region are trying to intercept them and mostly successful in it. But, you know, [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7986.099999999999s)]
*  Israelis, millions of Israelis were sheltering today, trying to hide from rockets, trying to [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7991.94s)]
*  protect themselves and their families from rockets. And that was a scary scene. And you know what I [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=7996.98s)]
*  hear from Israeli sources on the ground, in the IDF and mainly in the Air Force that are telling me [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8001.62s)]
*  that this was a much larger attack than the last one they saw in April in a sense that it was [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8007.7s)]
*  much more dangerous attack for Israelis and for citizens across the country in different cities [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8014.18s)]
*  in Israel. The entire country had alarms going off and that was a scary moment for [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8020.26s)]
*  Israelis. And you know what, when we talk about the retaliation, the Israeli retaliation, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8027.700000000001s)]
*  my sources on the ground are telling me that Prime Minister Netanyahu would like to retaliate [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8032.5s)]
*  and would like to hit hard. And this is happening because of two reasons, Biana. The first one is [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8036.58s)]
*  the political reason. He has to do that because of internal domestic political issues in Israel, [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8043.06s)]
*  but also the other issue is a strategic one. During the last attack, the last Iranian attack [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8048.580000000001s)]
*  in April, we saw that Israel's response was not very severe. It was a limited response. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8055.620000000001s)]
*  And after that, we saw that again, it happened tonight. So Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8063.860000000001s)]
*  they want to hit hard this time because otherwise they are too scared to see that happen again. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8070.26s)]
*  They feel like Iran is not deterred and they want to keep Iran deterred and or maybe to bring them [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8076.74s)]
*  back to that situation. So when we talk about strategy for Israel, they also recognize that [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8083.62s)]
*  this is a good time to try and also hurt Iran in a much more deeper way. And that can happen [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8090.66s)]
*  also, Biana, because as you know, you have a lot of sources in Israel. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8101.62s)]
*  Hezbollah is much weaker than the usual. And when Israel was afraid to take [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8105.54s)]
*  hard steps against Iran, it was because it had this huge proxy in the region, Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8112.74s)]
*  right next to the Israeli border at the northern border of Israel. So when Israel was too scared [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8118.82s)]
*  or thought it was wrong to attack Iran, it was also because of Hezbollah. And now when Hezbollah [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8126.42s)]
*  is weak, when Nasrallah is gone after the assassination last week, then Israel can do a [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8131.94s)]
*  much harder strike against Iran. And you know what? I also hear that the nuclear program of Iran is on [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8139.139999999999s)]
*  the table as well. That's an option that we haven't heard of in the past few years. You know, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8146.42s)]
*  Israel has tried to do that before. They didn't go for it. And now they're talking about maybe [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8152.34s)]
*  doing that. They will need the U.S. next to them. But this is a very interesting time frame [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8158.9s)]
*  of opportunity that they can try to do that because Iran is weaker without its proxies in the region. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8166.1s)]
*  And David, that's why people, some in this government, many Israelis, former Prime Minister [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8174.82s)]
*  Naftali Bennett are calling this a unique opportunity, perhaps the only opportunity to [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8181.14s)]
*  have Iran so exposed, given how decapitated its proxies are at this moment, to go after what Israel [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8185.78s)]
*  has long said is the biggest existential threat against the country that they view externally, [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8194.18s)]
*  and that is Iran's nuclear program and facilities. How likely do you think we are to see [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8198.82s)]
*  Israel try to strike their nuclear facilities? [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8205.38s)]
*  Well, it's certainly possible, although that is a huge leap on the escalatory ladder based on what [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8210.98s)]
*  we've seen so far. So I'm not sure personally I would expect that to happen in the in the hours [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8216.9s)]
*  and days after this attack. But certainly, I mean, these these people are correct in identifying the [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8222.58s)]
*  fact that Iran is the central source of all the chaos going on. They are greatly weakened and on [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8227.78s)]
*  the defensive. They were not able today to really respond effectively. And Israel no doubt should [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8232.74s)]
*  and certainly will continue to press its advantages. They also have unfinished business in Lebanon, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8239.54s)]
*  and I think it's important that they continue to to wrap things up there as effectively as they can. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8244.42s)]
*  Can they do both at the same time? Can they continue what they said may be a limited, [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8251.140000000001s)]
*  precise operations in southern Lebanon that they said could go on for for days, perhaps, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8255.54s)]
*  and also now have to calibrate what a response to Iran's unprecedented attack may look like? [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8260.42s)]
*  Well, if they have to, I'm sure they can. But I think their preference would be for sequential [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8269.94s)]
*  operations, just as they turn to north their northern border in Lebanon, really only after the [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8276.1s)]
*  main thrust of the Gaza operation, which is still ongoing, but the main thrust [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8282.1s)]
*  is beginning to wrap up. And then they could devote the bandwidth and resources needed [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8286.5s)]
*  to the operations that we've seen that are so spectacular against Lebanon. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8290.66s)]
*  And I think they may indeed have the same idea of sequencing toward Iran. But I would also underscore [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8294.5s)]
*  that the the problem we face with Iran really is a requires a marathon, not a sprint. And so the [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8301.140000000001s)]
*  idea that you can just rush into ideas that are going to change the equation right now. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8308.5s)]
*  Yeah, they should take every opportunity as it's presented. But I also think we have to bear in [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8312.58s)]
*  mind that that they that the Iranians have multiple ways to fight back. And we need to be [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8318.1s)]
*  working to eliminate all of those, whether it's the Houthis interference with international [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8323.86s)]
*  shipping, whether it's the militias that they have in their employ in Iraq, whether it's Hezbollah, [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8327.7s)]
*  which all clearly decapitated the IRCG is there and they're going to take over Hezbollah. I [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8333.22s)]
*  suspect they will they will be back in the game. So I wouldn't try to do all of it at the same time. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8338.5s)]
*  The United States should also in addition to simply defending Israel as effectively as it did today, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8344.5s)]
*  we also need to join in that effort to go after these Iranian assets around the Arab world. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8349.779999999999s)]
*  So, Hagar, does that suggest that it's not just defending Israel that the U.S. needs to do now? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8354.66s)]
*  It's perhaps even being more proactive and kinetically involved in the region? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8360.34s)]
*  Well, the U.S. is already quite quite involved. I mean, we have a lot of very heavy military [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8367.62s)]
*  presence, a lot of carriers and troops that have been increasingly moved into the region since [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8371.78s)]
*  October seven. And it certainly it certainly argues for a greater priority or emphasis on U.S. national [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8376.18s)]
*  security objectives in the Middle East, something that the administration since President Obama have [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8384.34s)]
*  been looking to turn away from because it's just been nothing but sucking America's problems with [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8390.42s)]
*  it. And there's not much interest in pursuing war in this region. But that said, the U.S. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8397.060000000001s)]
*  promise to defend Israel serves as a very strong deterrent against Iranian direct involvement and [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8403.060000000001s)]
*  confrontation. And I don't want to dismiss, of course, this attack that they've pursued [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8409.78s)]
*  just now and certainly again in April. They are Israel will respond. Obviously, the U.S. has said [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8415.3s)]
*  that they back Israel, that they support them. And that is the right response. That's something [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8420.34s)]
*  that every proxy is listening to. And there is, as the ambassador noted as well, this is the proxies [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8424.66s)]
*  are weakening. And we're seeing that this is there's a sequential element to this, to the military [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8432.5s)]
*  strategy that Israel is pursuing. And it seems to be that over time, as we have seen these proxies [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8437.46s)]
*  weaken further, Israel has shifted a little bit its goals. And for that reason, I expect this war [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8442.34s)]
*  to go on for a while and perhaps like in a war of attrition where you're going to have peaks and [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8448.18s)]
*  valleys. And right now we're in a peak. And that is because they've seen how much they've been able [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8451.94s)]
*  to weaken these proxies. And they certainly don't want to go back to the way that things were, [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8456.34s)]
*  the status quo before October 7. This is an opportunity for them to really fundamentally [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8461.22s)]
*  change how things are on the ground and fundamentally change the threats that these [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8466.82s)]
*  terrorist groups and Iranian proxies pose. But to your question about the United States, [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8470.26s)]
*  no matter what the U.S. is going to want to do, whether it's the current Biden administration, [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8474.74s)]
*  a future Kamala administration, future Trump administration, it's very clear that the Middle [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8479.94s)]
*  East is going to be a priority for our national security objectives going on forward. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8485.22s)]
*  Yeah. And quickly, Neria, it is quite telling that sadly the one area that we haven't talked [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8489.460000000001s)]
*  about this this hour or much even during our special coverage is Gaza and the ongoing [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8497.54s)]
*  push for some sort of ceasefire hostage deal. One hundred and one hostages remain there and they [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8504.820000000002s)]
*  are dying as we have sadly been hearing and seeing it before our eyes over the course of [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8511.380000000001s)]
*  the last several months. Does this do anything to bring some sort of resolution closer or no, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8518.02s)]
*  as we approach the one year anniversary? You're completely right, [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8523.86s)]
*  Diana. There are one hundred and one hostages still in Gaza, at least half of them considered [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8528.42s)]
*  still considered to be alive. But as we saw only in the last few weeks, we see that [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8535.220000000001s)]
*  their time is up. They don't have more time to wait for for for a hostages deal. And this needs [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8540.74s)]
*  to happen immediately. Also, that's important for Gaza as well. And we don't see these steps [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8546.980000000001s)]
*  taking that, helping that process, you know, getting to the end to seal the deal. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8553.7s)]
*  And we also don't hear the administration, the U.S. administration talking about it today. I spoke [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8560.660000000002s)]
*  to a family of a hostage today and he told me one of their members, he told me that they don't feel [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8566.820000000002s)]
*  that the U.S. administration is also putting too much pressure on that issue as well. I think that [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8574.34s)]
*  it's important to also talk about that. Yeah. And sadly, they felt that way for a while now [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8579.38s)]
*  about Prime Minister Netanyahu and his priorities as well. All right, everyone, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8584.58s)]
*  thank you so much for your time. Well, the U.S. has vowed to be quite full to be, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8588.9s)]
*  quote, fully supportive of Israel as it decides how to respond to Iran's attack. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8594.259999999998s)]
*  That cooperation was on display firsthand today as U.S. Navy destroyers intercepted about a dozen [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8598.82s)]
*  Iranian missiles headed toward Israel. Syrian Pentagon correspondent Orn Lieberman joins me [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8604.42s)]
*  with more. Orn, how is the U.S. preparing for a possible retaliatory strike by Israel against [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8609.38s)]
*  Iran? Are more service members headed to the region as well? Part of it is just that. It's [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8616.42s)]
*  the number and types of U.S. forces in the region. Fighter squadrons sent in. That's a very clear [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8621.779999999999s)]
*  message of deterrence to Iran. Those haven't been used against Iran, obviously, over the course of [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8627.3s)]
*  the last several months, but they're very much there and very much on display. They could play [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8633.22s)]
*  a role in air defense. There's a carrier strike group in the Gulf of Oman. There's an amphibious [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8638.18s)]
*  ready group in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as well as destroyers in the Eastern Med, [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8642.74s)]
*  as well as in the Red Sea. A guided missile submarine is also in the Red Sea. So all of that [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8647.300000000001s)]
*  is a message of deterrence that the U.S. is sending to Iran and its proxies in the region, [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8652.02s)]
*  as they've said from the very beginning here, trying to convince Iran and press Iran not to get [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8656.58s)]
*  involved and preparing for any sort of possible scenarios in how this plays out, in how Israel [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8661.380000000001s)]
*  responds to the Iranian attack. And Israel has made very clear that they will respond. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8667.14s)]
*  And I'll just point out, as we talk about this, one more thing here. In terms of the destroyers [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8671.939999999999s)]
*  intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles, the Pentagon was very clear to say they launched [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8675.939999999999s)]
*  a dozen interceptors. They did not say they intercepted a dozen missiles. It's very possible [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8679.539999999999s)]
*  they fired multiple interceptors at each missile to ensure that it was down before it hit Israel. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8685.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they did say the majority, though, were intercepted by Israel itself. Does the Pentagon [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8691.06s)]
*  have any idea as to how Israel might respond? And let me follow up to that with the likelihood [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8697.46s)]
*  of Israel not coordinating their response with the United States. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8703.619999999999s)]
*  We have seen a tremendous amount of coordination just in intercepting [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8710.58s)]
*  this aerial barrage. So that speaks to the likelihood of some level of coordination. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8714.42s)]
*  And yet we've also seen quite a bit of friction with Israel not giving the U.S. a heads up before [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8719.54s)]
*  it carried out the strike that killed Hassan Nasrallah, before it blew up Hezbollah pagers, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8724.42s)]
*  effectively just telling the U.S. that something would be happening. So we have seen some [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8729.54s)]
*  disconnects here. But in terms of a strike on Iran itself, that would obviously be a major [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8733.86s)]
*  risk to the extent that Israel can have it. So the U.S. will almost certainly be [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8742.660000000002s)]
*  an important part of that. In terms of what Israel will do, President Biden huddled with [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8746.9s)]
*  some of his top aides to try to get a better sense of [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8751.14s)]
*  contact with the Israelis as Israel plans its own response. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8762.74s)]
*  the State Department made clear that there will be a response coming. They wouldn't detail exactly [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8769.3s)]
*  what the U.S. would be doing in that. And we pressed the Pentagon on whether they were taking [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8773.46s)]
*  off the table or leaving on the table the possibility of striking Iran, that is the U.S. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8778.179999999998s)]
*  I don't think that's particularly likely. But it's worth asking that question as the U.S. tries to [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8782.5s)]
*  figure out what to do. And this feels very different than April 13th. In that case, that [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8786.74s)]
*  barrage was very much intercepted, the vast majority of it. And Biden urged Prime Minister [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8791.939999999999s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu here, take the win. Israel did carry out a strike in Iran, but it was [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8797.539999999999s)]
*  fairly minor, more a message that, hey, we can do this and a warning, don't give us a reason to do [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8802.42s)]
*  this again. Well, Israel just got that reason and has made very clear a response is coming. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8808.02s)]
*  Yeah, Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying Israel made a big mistake tonight and will be paying for [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8812.98s)]
*  it. Iran made a big mistake tonight and will be paying for it. Orrin Lieberman, thank you. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8817.7s)]
*  Joining me now, CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Cedric Layton. So, [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8821.86s)]
*  Colonel, walk us through some of the options that you think Israel may be weighing now in [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8826.5s)]
*  terms of what that response may look like. Yeah, Rihanna, I think there are several [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8831.3s)]
*  different options that Israel could be considering at this point. The maximalist option would be to [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8835.539999999999s)]
*  go after the Iranian nuclear facilities, as mentioned by former Prime Minister Bennett, [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8840.98s)]
*  Naftali Bennett, and a few others that had former positions in the Israeli government. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8847.38s)]
*  I think that is probably something that is not going to happen in that way, but it's apparently [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8852.9s)]
*  on the table, so we have to consider it. But what is more likely, I believe, is that the Israelis [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8859.22s)]
*  will try to do something involving military targets, standard military targets in Iran. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8864.099999999999s)]
*  So that could include striking airfields, radar installations, intelligence facilities, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8870.34s)]
*  those kinds of targets. I think that is certainly a possibility. The Israelis do have the capability [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8875.22s)]
*  to go after targets like that. They would have to probably fly around the Arabian Peninsula and [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8881.3s)]
*  engage in aerial refueling operations to do that, but it is a possibility. And of course, [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8887.54s)]
*  the other thing that the Israelis are doing is they are basically continuing their efforts [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8893.300000000001s)]
*  in both Lebanon and in Gaza to basically extricate themselves from the ring that [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8899.54s)]
*  Iran has used to try to contain them. And that involves the operations, of course, [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8908.42s)]
*  against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both of them, of course, Iranian proxies. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8912.9s)]
*  So that's the kind of thing that the Israelis are considering. Other options would include [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8918.02s)]
*  cyberattacks and also a combination of all of these types of operations that could potentially [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8922.42s)]
*  impact Iran in one way or the other. How concerned are you about U.S. interests [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8931.14s)]
*  being targeted by Iran, given that they're now anticipating some sort of response from Israel? [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8937.779999999999s)]
*  And I don't mean assets just in the region, but we have seen through especially their proxies, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8945.38s)]
*  Iran really carrying out terror attacks throughout the world. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8952.34s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And do you think of bombings, for example, in as far away as in Buenos Aires [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8958.42s)]
*  and in Argentina and throughout Europe and in Africa? So those are the kinds of things that [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8963.779999999999s)]
*  Iran is fully capable of doing. So I think the Iranians are probably going to go for an asymmetric [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8969.859999999999s)]
*  response or at least a continuation of their response through asymmetric means. And that, [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8976.259999999998s)]
*  on their part, could also include things like attacks through proxies or through their [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8981.3s)]
*  intelligence service in areas throughout the world, potentially most likely in the Middle East, [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8987.06s)]
*  but also in Europe and even in North and South America. So those are the kinds of things that we [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8993.06s)]
*  should be paying attention to from an intelligence perspective. And I think that is something that [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=8997.779999999999s)]
*  the Iranians might try to do. They believe that the U.S. is inextricably linked to Israel, [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9003.3s)]
*  and they will treat us in that way unless they find another way to deal with us. And that, [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9009.46s)]
*  I think, is going to be the fundamental question that the Iranians will have to sort out and we [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9014.9s)]
*  will have to sort out in response to them as well. Yeah, they have targeted U.S. nationals, [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9019.46s)]
*  including some that have worked in the U.S. government. In Donald Trump's administration, [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9023.539999999999s)]
*  John Bolton comes to mind as well. Talk about the missiles that Iran deployed. Iranian media outlet [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9028.259999999998s)]
*  Mare News is reporting that they use their Fata 1 hypersonic missile for the first time. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9035.3s)]
*  We haven't confirmed that, but if indeed that is the case, what are the implications here? [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9041.699999999999s)]
*  So a hypersonic missile is, as the name implies, is something that can fly at a very, very quick [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9046.58s)]
*  speed. And basically, we're talking at a minimum of five times the speed of sound. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9052.900000000001s)]
*  This particular missile is based on several variants that the Iranians have been able to [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9058.58s)]
*  access through the Russians and through other parties like the North Koreans. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9066.5s)]
*  And the hypersonic capability, of course, is a very modern capability. And the Russians [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9070.98s)]
*  are very well advanced in the development of those kinds of missiles. If Iran used a Fata missile in [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9077.22s)]
*  this particular attack on Israel, that would be significant. Chances are that it would be, [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9085.539999999999s)]
*  it could in some ways be a mistake because if it was used, it apparently wasn't very effective, [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9094.5s)]
*  number one. And number two, if it is possible to retrieve debris from that missile, then the [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9100.900000000001s)]
*  Israelis can determine exactly how that missile works and learn more about it and thus improve [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9106.5s)]
*  their air defenses against it. So that's the kind of thing that the Israelis, of course, [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9111.94s)]
*  are going to be looking for. This particular missile is very, very new in the Iranian inventory. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9117.140000000001s)]
*  And I think it's somewhat unlikely that they used it. But then again, we have to look at the [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9122.82s)]
*  evidence and have to see whether or not that actually happened. All right, Colonel Cedric [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9126.82s)]
*  Leighton, thank you so much. You bet, Beanna. Well, it is 530 in the morning in Israel, [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9131.14s)]
*  the country now set to wake up and assess some of the damage from Iran's strike as Israel [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9135.619999999999s)]
*  continues to carry out strikes in Beirut. I want to bring in CNN International Diplomatic Editor [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9140.9s)]
*  Nick Robertson, who is in Haifa, and international correspondent Jemana Karachi in Beirut. Jemana, [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9146.1s)]
*  let me start with you. The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders tonight in Lebanon [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9151.46s)]
*  and is striking Hezbollah targets once again in Beirut. What more do we know about these strikes? [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9156.5s)]
*  Well, you know, Beanna, in the past few hours, we saw these posts on X by the Israeli military's [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9166.179999999998s)]
*  Arabic language spokesman asking people in several neighborhoods of Beirut's southern suburbs to [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9173.859999999999s)]
*  evacuate, saying that they will be striking Hezbollah targets, telling people that they are near [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9180.34s)]
*  Hezbollah facilities and that they are in danger and they should move immediately. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9187.14s)]
*  In a short time after that, those airstrikes began. We have seen several airstrikes over the [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9191.86s)]
*  past few hours targeting the southern suburbs. Our team here heard them and we saw smoke rising [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9197.22s)]
*  from that part of the capital. But right now we don't know what the target is other than [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9203.54s)]
*  the Israeli military saying that it's going after Hezbollah targets and infrastructure in that [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9209.94s)]
*  area where Hezbollah is known to have a strong presence, where its leadership had been based. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9215.86s)]
*  But it is also, Beanna, home to, it was, hundreds of thousands of people. We have seen a mass exodus [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9222.5s)]
*  from the southern suburbs, civilians, families who have evacuated, who have moved out in recent days. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9230.58s)]
*  But there are people who still did not want to leave. They've remained in their homes. And these [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9237.78s)]
*  warnings coming at between 12 a.m. and 3 a.m., it's highly unlikely that people would have been [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9242.58s)]
*  sitting and waiting and checking social media to see these warnings coming in. So, [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9251.86s)]
*  you know, it's been very difficult for the civilians here who have been bearing the brunt [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9257.86s)]
*  of this war. And earlier in the day, we saw another evacuation order just like that for 27 [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9264.099999999999s)]
*  villages also in southern Lebanon, some of them close to the border. And, you know, [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9271.22s)]
*  it's been very difficult for a lot of people from what we've heard to actually evacuate, to leave [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9277.779999999999s)]
*  because of the airstrikes and the artillery shelling. But I have to say, during that Iranian [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9282.9s)]
*  attack on Israel, we did see what appeared to be a lull in these airstrikes, but they seem to have [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9289.62s)]
*  resumed since. And, Jamada, you spent a lot of time with some of the country's most vulnerable, [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9296.820000000002s)]
*  as you have throughout this war coverage, and that is, of course, the children. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9302.26s)]
*  Let me turn to you, Nick. You spent a big part of the day along the Lebanon border [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9307.460000000001s)]
*  as these missiles were predominantly headed towards Tel Aviv. What did you see in here, in Haifa? [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9313.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what we've been told, the operation along the border is limited, localized and targeted [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9323.94s)]
*  raids. And the bit of the border that we visited was relatively quiet. And I think that really [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9330.66s)]
*  speaks to the localized part of what the IDF is saying about these raids. Interestingly, [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9336.98s)]
*  Haifa was perhaps one of the only areas in the country that didn't get caught up in those, [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9342.42s)]
*  in the sirens and the shelter warnings that the rest of the country was going through and [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9350.1s)]
*  experiencing when Iran's ballistic missiles were flying into the center and the south of Israel. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9356.42s)]
*  Perhaps that's because nothing was targeted here. Perhaps Iran assessed that Haifa and this corner [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9363.78s)]
*  of northwestern Israel was really so far across Israel that its weapons systems could be [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9371.86s)]
*  more easily downed and intercepted, or potentially they just felt that the targets up here [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9380.02s)]
*  were not the targets that they wanted to hit. If that's the case, then that's a sort of something [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9386.660000000002s)]
*  of a statement about their support for Hezbollah, because it's from the north of Israel that the [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9394.660000000002s)]
*  command centers, the troops are based that are involved in these new cross-border operations, [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9401.38s)]
*  and that the skies are monitored for the fighter jets that are flying on the bombing missions in [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9407.3s)]
*  the south of Lebanon, in Beirut, in the Beqa Valley. So it appears that while Iran has hit [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9413.22s)]
*  or tried to hit targets, it wants to hit. It doesn't seem to be targets that are going to [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9420.42s)]
*  have a direct effect on helping protect its proxy, Hezbollah, in Lebanon. It's how it appears today. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9427.38s)]
*  Of course, we're aware that Israel will strike back for deterrence, and Iran may decide to strike [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9436.339999999998s)]
*  back again and try to hit different targets, but that's how it looks this evening, Biana. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9442.9s)]
*  Is it surprising at all that we didn't see Hezbollah, which we know that it has been quite [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9448.18s)]
*  severely degraded by Israel over the past couple of weeks, and its air force taking out its missiles [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9454.820000000002s)]
*  and its missile launchers, but we know that they had a huge arsenal, and even the IDF in some of [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9462.42s)]
*  its early incursions into Lebanon has said that they found more RPGs, more rockets, more missiles. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9469.220000000001s)]
*  Is it a surprise that we didn't see any kind of attack from Hezbollah as Iran was launching its [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9476.02s)]
*  ballistic missiles? I think it is and it isn't, because as you say there, Israel really believes [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9481.380000000001s)]
*  it's had a devastating impact in the short term at least on the command and control, on the [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9491.54s)]
*  leadership, on Hezbollah's ability to project the strength that it was perceived to have from [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9497.78s)]
*  all these weapons systems, some of which have been targeted. And if you went back three weeks [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9505.86s)]
*  and said that Iran was planning an attack on Israel, you would have expected Iran to coordinate [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9512.5s)]
*  that in part with Hezbollah, and both their proxy and Iran try to sort of use missiles coming in [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9518.26s)]
*  from different directions to confuse Israel's defenses, to try to defeat Israel's defenses, [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9527.54s)]
*  and we didn't see any of that. There's just been one alert that we've heard about in the last sort [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9533.3s)]
*  of 30 minutes along the border in the north of Israel, and I looked at that border village on the [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9538.66s)]
*  map. The house that is closest to the border there is about 100 feet away in that village, [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9545.779999999999s)]
*  so this village where the alarm has gone off this evening is a few hundred feet from Lebanon, [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9551.619999999999s)]
*  and that's exactly the type of place that the IDF is saying that Hezbollah pops up in the window [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9557.54s)]
*  of a house with a shoulder-launched rocket-propelled grenade and will fire those missiles, fire those [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9563.7s)]
*  short-range missiles that are impossible to intercept into the houses inside of Israel. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9570.900000000001s)]
*  So, you know, if that's the maximum that Hezbollah is able to do this evening, absolutely, [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9576.820000000002s)]
*  to your question, that really speaks to their inability to come out at this particular moment [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9583.62s)]

*  to the United Nations, Danny Donon. Mr. Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us. The Prime [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9809.699999999999s)]
*  Minister telling his security cabinet that Iran made a big mistake tonight and will pay for it. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9814.98s)]
*  How can we expect to see? What can we expect to see from Israel's response and when? [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9821.14s)]
*  And, Biana, what we have experienced was the largest attack ever on modern history from a [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9827.38s)]
*  nation state to another one. We will retaliate. We will send a very clear message to the ayatollahs [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9835.86s)]
*  in Tehran. We are thinking about what to do and how to do it. But I can tell you tonight that [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9842.1s)]
*  it will be painful. What we have seen in Israel, that the 9.5 million Israelis had to run for [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9848.66s)]
*  shelters looking for a place to hide. Imagine the entire population of New York City that [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9855.54s)]
*  would have to evacuate within 10 minutes and looking for bomb shelters. That's unacceptable. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9862.02s)]
*  And also, Iran, for many months they used the proxies. They used Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9867.7s)]
*  What happened today, they actually attacked us directly. So they pulled the masks and we [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9873.94s)]
*  realize that today we have to send a clear message to them and they will pay for that. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9880.5s)]
*  AMNA NAWAZ, U.S. Defense Secretary, Austin, [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9885.78s)]
*  spoke with his counterpart, Defense Minister Yoav Galant, a number of times today, I believe, too. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9889.46s)]
*  U.S. Defense Secretary Austin just tweeting calling Iran's attack [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9896.02s)]
*  an outrageous act of aggression. I don't believe that we have reported [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9899.3s)]
*  a conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. When do we expect the two of [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9904.5s)]
*  them to speak? Well, the prime minister spoke with President Biden earlier this week. I'm sure [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9909.62s)]
*  they spoke about all the scenarios. We have very close cooperation with the U.S. We appreciate [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9916.740000000002s)]
*  their support. And we always take a lot of pride in the interception, but I think it should not [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9922.18s)]
*  misguide us. We have to look at the intentions of the Iranians. And when a brutal nation like Iran [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9928.42s)]
*  sending 200 ballistic missiles over the civilian population, that's what we look at. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9935.06s)]
*  And we are very proud of the interception, but we should look at the intentions. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9941.22s)]
*  Yeah, it is unprecedented. And you had the majority of the country for at least an hour [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9944.82s)]
*  hiding in their bomb shelters as the rain of ballistic missiles came [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9950.98s)]
*  falling through the air. As you said, thankfully, the majority of them were intercepted by Israel. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9955.539999999999s)]
*  The United States had Navy destroyers that were firing approximately a dozen [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9962.18s)]
*  interceptions as well. But looking ahead now in terms of what a response may look like, [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9966.5s)]
*  former Israeli Prime Minister Bennett characterized this as a once in a 50-year opportunity for Israel [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9971.86s)]
*  to attack Iran, saying that they made a fatal mistake. And it's not just attacking Iran. He's [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9978.18s)]
*  specifically saying that Israel should go after Iran's nuclear program, its nuclear facilities, [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9985.220000000001s)]
*  which I don't have to tell you most Israelis view as an existential threat longer term [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9991.46s)]
*  to the state of Israel and its security. Do you agree with that? [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=9997.14s)]
*  Well, I don't think we should go into specifics. We will take it very seriously, and we will make [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10001.38s)]
*  sure that we will send a very clear message. And only a few days ago, we reached Yemen after the [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10007.859999999999s)]
*  Houthis sent the missiles into Israel. So we proved to the Iranians that we have the capabilities [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10014.419999999998s)]
*  to reach anywhere, any destination in Iran. And I'm sure that tonight the Ayatollahs are not [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10020.1s)]
*  sleeping tight because they know that we know where they are. They know about our capabilities. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10026.42s)]
*  So I cannot tell you what we will do or will not do, but we will send them a clear message. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10032.1s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu said it very clearly when he was at the UN earlier this week, and [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10037.7s)]
*  he said it, if somebody will attack us, we will attack them back. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10043.460000000001s)]
*  Are you expecting a response to be coordinated with the United States? And in addition to not [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10046.98s)]
*  only protecting Israel defensively, are you hoping that whatever Israel decides to do, [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10054.58s)]
*  the United States participates perhaps even kinetically? [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10062.1s)]
*  So we don't expect the U.S. to fight our fights. We have the capabilities, [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10067.46s)]
*  but we will need the support of our allies. We will need their backing and support, and I [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10072.58s)]
*  believe we will receive it. And I think it's not good for both sides that we will ask for permission [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10077.14s)]
*  when we defend ourselves. Israel is a sovereign country. We have our own military, our own [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10083.38s)]
*  capabilities. Yes, we should speak about the goals. We should speak about what the objectives [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10088.1s)]
*  of every attack, but I don't think that we have to come and ask for permission. It will put both [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10093.46s)]
*  Israel and the U.S. in a very sensitive situation. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10098.66s)]
*  Let me ask you about UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez and his response, at least via Twitter, [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10102.34s)]
*  following this barrage, this unprecedented barrage of ballistic missiles that Iran has [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10108.5s)]
*  lobbed towards Israel. He said, I condemn the broadening of the Middle East conflict with [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10114.34s)]
*  escalation after escalation. This must stop. We absolutely need a ceasefire, no mention of Iran, [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10118.98s)]
*  no mention of the ballistic missiles. Is this a satisfactory statement you feel from the [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10125.38s)]
*  leader there at the UN? Absolutely not. It's very disappointing. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10132.179999999998s)]
*  Basically, you have an aggressor and you have a country that defends itself. And once you start [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10137.939999999999s)]
*  to speak about de-escalation or calling both sides, it shows you don't have the moral clarity. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10143.22s)]
*  And tomorrow morning, we're going to have an emergency session of the Security Council [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10149.22s)]
*  with the Secretary General. And I will say it publicly, it's unacceptable to put Israel and [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10153.54s)]
*  Iran in the same equation. You have to name Iran. You have to name Hezbollah. And you have to say [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10158.820000000002s)]
*  that Israel has the right to defend itself. And I think the ones who are calling both sides to show [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10165.94s)]
*  restraint, basically are sending a message to Iran that they continue with what they are doing. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10171.220000000001s)]
*  But regardless of the declaration at the UN, we are very determined. We are very determined [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10176.580000000002s)]
*  to hit Iran back forcefully. Also in Israel, had it not been for this [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10182.099999999999s)]
*  unprecedented attack by Iran, we would have been covering the other major development [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10188.019999999999s)]
*  and the tragic news of a terror attack in Tel Aviv, killing six, seven, I believe, [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10193.06s)]
*  Israelis. What more do we know about this instance? Well, that was a vicious terror attack in the [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10199.22s)]
*  middle of Tel Aviv, shooting civilians. Unfortunately, we have too many casualties. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10206.02s)]
*  We cannot say it was coordinated, but some of our enemies think that we are weak because we are in [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10213.7s)]
*  pain since October 7th. We have the hostages. So they think that we are weak, but they are mistaken. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10219.54s)]
*  We are very strong, very united. And I can assure you that the people of Israel will be strong, [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10225.140000000001s)]
*  stand up and fight back. We have seen it also with Hezbollah. We will see it also with Iran. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10232.74s)]

*  Ambassador Danny Danon, thank you so much for your time on this very, very busy day [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10242.38s)]
*  for you and your country. Appreciate it. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10243.38s)]
*  Thank you very much, Bianna. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10246.34s)]

*  Former President Trump today blamed the Biden-Harris administration for the unrest in the Middle East. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10248.74s)]
*  DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States of America, [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10255.14s)]
*  Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel. And we just, it's, I have been talking about World [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10256.5s)]
*  War III for a long time. And I don't want to make predictions, because the predictions always come [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10264.58s)]
*  true. We're not going to make, but they are very close to global catastrophe. We have a [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10270.1s)]
*  non-existent president and a non-existent vice president who should be in charge, [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10274.66s)]
*  but nobody knows what's going on. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10279.94s)]
*  AMNA NAWAZ [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10282.019999999999s)]
*  I want to get right to Aaron David Miller. He's a former Middle East negotiator for the State [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10283.22s)]
*  Department. Also with me is Bobby Goscha, senior editor. This wasn't the case when I was president. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10286.98s)]
*  BOBBY GOSHA, Senior Editor, State Department, State Department, State Department, State Department, [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10292.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Look, having voted for Republicans, Democrats and worked for Republicans, [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10294.74s)]
*  Democrats, you can take this as a partisan comment or not. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10299.46s)]
*  The reality when it comes to diplomacy, which is one of the two main instruments of American [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10303.14s)]
*  foreign policy, Donald Trump weakened the American hand by extricating the United States from the [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10309.22s)]
*  Iran nuclear agreement, bringing Iran now within weeks of producing enough of some material [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10316.34s)]
*  for six nuclear weapons. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10321.38s)]
*  With respect to force, in September 2019, Iran sent drones and cruise missiles, which [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10323.939999999999s)]
*  attacked two critically important oil exporting facilities in Saudi Arabia. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10330.58s)]
*  The response of the Trump administration, there wasn't a response. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10336.5s)]
*  So, on matters of force and diplomacy, when it comes to Middle East, it seems to me that [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10340.42s)]
*  it's a patently absurd argument to make. The world, according to Donald Trump, obviously would have [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10345.140000000001s)]
*  been better when he's president. And that argument is, it reduces matters to the absurd. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10352.26s)]
*  AMNA NAWAZ [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10357.7s)]
*  Bobby, how much higher are the stakes and the pressure on the Biden administration in particular? [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10358.900000000001s)]
*  Obviously, he's in his final months of his presidency. He is campaigning for his vice president. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10362.98s)]
*  He is hoping for stability, which is one of the reasons why they have constantly been calling for [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10369.06s)]
*  de-escalation. But, clearly, this is out of their hands at this point. How much of a vulnerability [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10373.539999999999s)]
*  is this for the administration and thus for the Harris campaign as well? [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10379.859999999999s)]
*  BORIS KONRAD [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10385.22s)]
*  Well, it is a problem for Harris because she has to deal with elements of her own party. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10387.14s)]
*  Less than two months away from an election, elements of her own party that want a ceasefire, [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10393.859999999999s)]
*  want to hear her make more forceful statements demanding an Israeli ceasefire. But that's [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10400.34s)]
*  clearly not going to happen. The president has not been able to restrain Bibi Netanyahu at all. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10406.42s)]
*  And now he's gotten more and more provocation, to which he can now respond. And he will get plenty of [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10412.18s)]
*  support within his own country from Israelis, I suspect, across the board, to retaliate. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10419.94s)]
*  Now, ironically, Iran in this moment, having fired off these ballistic missiles, I think Iran [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10426.18s)]
*  is now counting on President Biden to try and restrain Bibi Netanyahu. And that does not seem [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10432.58s)]
*  to me like a very wise gamble to take. President Biden has not shown the ability to do that. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10438.26s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu has not shown any interest in being restrained. And now I think he will feel [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10444.34s)]
*  even more justified in taking actions in any direction that he pleases. [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10450.9s)]
*  AMNA NAWAZAN Well, was that just a miscalculation then on Iran's part, [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10456.66s)]
*  Aaron, because we know leading up to today's attack, the Biden administration had been [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10461.14s)]
*  forcefully publicly pressuring the Iranian regime, saying that they would not be able to control [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10467.22s)]
*  Israel's response, that it would be a much more severe response. If Israel is directly attacked, [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10473.46s)]
*  we sent more assets to the region. And yet none of that seemed to deter Iran. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10479.939999999999s)]
*  AARON KESSELHAUSER I think the Iranians have been struggling for months now, [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10484.82s)]
*  particularly since the July 31 assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran with a [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10489.38s)]
*  remote-controlled device. The Israelis haven't claimed responsibility for it. But who else could [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10497.46s)]
*  have done that? The Iranians have been struggling with a way to respond, trying to find a way to [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10502.82s)]
*  navigate a course between more than they did April 13, 14, in which only 99 percent of those [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10509.38s)]
*  high-trajectory weapons never even made it into Israeli airspace, on one hand, and not provoking [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10515.619999999999s)]
*  a considerable, severe Israeli response. And yet I don't think, frankly, beyond that the [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10520.74s)]
*  Iranians have found that sweet spot. I think the Israelis will retaliate. I think they cannot allow, [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10526.5s)]
*  in now two instances, norms have been broken, April 13, 14, and now. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10535.54s)]
*  We have been living on borrowed time since October 7 and October 8. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10541.86s)]
*  You have got three wars of attrition ongoing, and there is no end in sight, one between Israel and [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10546.02s)]
*  Hamas, one between Israel and Hezbollah, and one between Israel and Iran. There is no diplomatic [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10550.66s)]
*  endgame here. The best you are going to be able to do is manage this through deterrence containment, [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10555.94s)]
*  and maybe, maybe through smart, diplomatic, what I would call transactions. But even that right now [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10560.42s)]
*  seems a bridge too far. We are in for a very bad patch. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10567.94s)]
*  Babi, if the Israelis do strike either Iran's nuclear facilities or its oil facilities, [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10572.339999999998s)]
*  how would the region respond to that? [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10580.98s)]
*  Well, not very well. The region is on tenterhooks now. This is the worst-case scenario that [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10586.339999999998s)]
*  anybody in Riyadh or in Dubai or in any of the other capitals in the region could have imagined, [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10590.9s)]
*  the direct conflict between Iran and Israel. So any escalation from here on in is going to be [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10597.3s)]
*  bad news for everybody, not just in the region, but for the wider world. The region, obviously, [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10604.099999999999s)]
*  the concern will be the greatest because they are right there, directly under the line of fire. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10610.259999999998s)]
*  There is always a concern that Iran may, and its many allies, may shoot off rockets in all [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10615.38s)]
*  kinds of directions. Aaron referred to the attacks on Saudi installations that had become [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10621.7s)]
*  almost commonplace a couple of years ago. We haven't heard of that in a couple of years, [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10628.02s)]
*  but that could happen again. And with all of Iran's many allies, the Houthis and Hezbollah, [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10632.740000000002s)]
*  and of course the militias in Iraq who have been not as active as I might have expected, there's [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10639.7s)]
*  always the thing that everybody dislikes the most, which is unpredictability. Markets, [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10646.34s)]
*  governments, publics, we all hate unpredictability. And what we are entering now is a period [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10654.18s)]
*  of complete and utter unpredictability. We are long and deep into this zone of, [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10660.9s)]
*  we're in a place where we've not been, and nobody can make safe predictions. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10667.380000000001s)]
*  That's what's going to keep government planners, military planners up at night all over the region. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10671.62s)]
*  Yeah, so many Rubicons have already been crossed. So many red lines have been crossed, [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10677.380000000001s)]
*  as well as Israelis now wake up to assess the damage from that unprecedented strike. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10681.86s)]
*  It's worth noting that tonight in Israel is the start of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVg0rJYCCAI&t=10689.220000000001s)]
