# Why some ultra-Orthodox Jews are enlisting in the IDF
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM)
*  The Hamas attacks have caused a significant shift here in Israel among many in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=0.0s)]
*  Traditionally, they refuse to sign up for military service, which is mandatory for most men and women in Israel after their 18th birthday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=6.88s)]
*  But that's changing after the October 7th Hamas attack that killed 1,400 men, women and children. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Moti Leitner reads the Torah at least an hour every day. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=22.16s)]
*  His family is one of the 1.2 million ultra-Orthodox Jews, or hesedim, who live here in Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=32.16s)]
*  For decades, many in his community have fought against Israel's mandatory military service for every Jewish, Israeli man and woman as soon as they turn 18. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=40.56s)]
*  This year, the ultra-Orthodox tried to get a law passed to exempt them from having to enlist, a major source of friction in Israeli society. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=51.44s)]
*  Then, October 7th happened. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=59.28s)]
*  Have you ever fired a weapon, picked up a weapon before? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=62.64s)]
*  No. I never held a gun, something like this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=66.16s)]
*  That is about to change. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=70.16s)]
*  In the few days I will go to the Israeli army. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=72.16s)]
*  Leitner enlisted after the murderous attack by Hamas on men, women and children in Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=78.4s)]
*  It completely shook us, broke all conceptions, he says. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=86.56s)]
*  We thought we had the privilege to stand at the side and not be part of, and now we realize it's just not sustainable. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  He says most of the ultra-Orthodox here believe their jobs are to keep the Jewish religion alive and well, spending their days studying the Torah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli military reported between 2019 and 2021 only about 1200 or so ultra-Orthodox Jews were conscripted annually. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=109.44s)]
*  That's out of 12,000 potential applicants. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=120.64s)]
*  Why did the Hasidim, the ultra-Orthodox, not want to serve in the army? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=124.72s)]
*  The ultra-Orthodox people in Israel have an ethos according to which studying Torah gives the nation a metaphysical layer of defense, he says. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=131.04s)]
*  But he says he cannot see how that is enough now, and he says he knows many other Hasidim feel the same. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=142.88s)]
*  I personally sat in my living room and just cried for a day. We can't just go on with our daily lives. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=150.08s)]
*  We said never again after the Holocaust, and if we want to be able to say that again to next generations and promise our children a sustainable future, we have to solve this issue. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=159.84s)]
*  In Hebrew, this sign says, together we will win. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=171.36s)]
*  It's very rare to see this kind of nationalistic language in ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods like this one in Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=174.0s)]
*  You're also seeing a lot of Israeli flags plastered all over the place. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=180.72s)]
*  That just doesn't really happen during normal times. It gives you some sense that opinions among the ultra-Orthodox have changed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  Leitner's wife's opinion has certainly changed, but she does worry about one thing. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=194.72s)]
*  I worry more if he don't know how to hold a weapon, and I also want to know how to, I want a license for a gun also. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=199.84s)]
*  You know, we are not in Switzerland. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=214.24s)]
*  There is one more difficult thing he has to do with his family before he goes to serve. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=218.24s)]
*  Tell his children Yehuda, Elizabeth, and Abigail, nine, seven, and six years old. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=223.52s)]
*  They play oblivious to the changes they're about to experience at home due to war. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=230.0s)]
*  Now, Modi Leitner is not the only member of his family that is going to go enlist. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=238.72s)]
*  He has enlisted and so has his twin brother who lives in California. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=245.12s)]
*  His twin brother is leaving there to come to Israel. They hope to go into the armed forces together. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWLNF_s6xkM&t=250.0s)]
