**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY)
*  I want to thank you for coming here today and for the unequivocal support you have given [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel during these trying times, a support that reflects the overwhelming will of the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=6.84s)]
*  American people. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=12.76s)]
*  I've seen your support every day in the depth and breadth of cooperation that we have had [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=14.96s)]
*  since the beginning of this war, a level of cooperation that is truly unprecedented in [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=21.88s)]
*  the history of the great alliance between our two nations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=29.08s)]
*  We see that support in your steadfast commitment to provide Israel with the tools we need to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=32.64s)]
*  defend ourselves. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=38.14s)]
*  We see that support in the clear message you've sent our enemies not to test our resolve and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=40.12s)]
*  in the two American carrier battle groups that you sent to the region to back up those [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=46.44s)]
*  words with action. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=52.68s)]
*  But above all, Mr. President, the world sees that support in the moral clarity that you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=55.28s)]
*  have demonstrated from the moment Israel was attacked. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  You've rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=65.4s)]
*  of barbarism. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=71.12s)]
*  You described what Hamas did as sheer evil. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  It is exactly that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=78.56s)]
*  Hamas murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=80.88s)]
*  They burnt people alive. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=86.32s)]
*  They raped and murdered women. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=88.28s)]
*  They beheaded soldiers. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  They search for the secret hiding places where parents hid their children. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=92.08s)]
*  Just imagine, Mr. President, the fear and the panic of those little children in their [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  last moments as the monsters discovered found out their hiding places. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  Hamas kidnapped women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=113.64s)]
*  I know you share our outrage on this and I know you share our determination to bring [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=120.16s)]
*  these people back. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis, maybe more. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=127.58s)]
*  This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=134.4s)]
*  This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=137.86s)]
*  That's 29-11. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=143.16s)]
*  That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=145.88s)]
*  Mr. President, you rightly said that Hamas is worse than ISIS. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=152.28s)]
*  The German Chancellor who visited here yesterday said that Hamas were the new Nazis. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=158.08s)]
*  You're both right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=164.12s)]
*  And just as a civilized world united to defeat the Nazis and united to defeat ISIS, the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=165.56s)]
*  civilized world must unite to defeat Hamas. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=172.72s)]
*  I can assure you, Mr. President, Israel is united to defeat Hamas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=176.84s)]
*  And we will defeat Hamas and remove this terrible threat from our lives. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=182.32s)]
*  The forces of civilization will prevail for our sake, for your sake, for peace and security [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=187.68s)]
*  in our region and in the world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, for the people of Israel, there's only one thing better than having a true friend [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=197.4s)]
*  like you standing with Israel, and that is having you standing in Israel. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=204.16s)]
*  Your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel at a time of war. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  It is deeply, deeply moving. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=220.72s)]
*  It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to the future of the Jewish people and the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=224.12s)]
*  one and only Jewish state. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=228.95999999999998s)]
*  So I know I speak for all the people of Israel when I say thank you, Mr. President. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for standing with Israel today, tomorrow and always. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=238.16s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=245.0s)]
*  Look, folks, I wanted to be here today for a simple reason. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=247.56s)]
*  I wanted the people of Israel, the people of the world, to know where the United States stands. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=252.56s)]
*  I've had my great Secretary of State here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=259.56s)]
*  He's been here for a lot. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=261.36s)]
*  But I wanted to personally come and make that clear. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=263.8s)]
*  Terrorist group Hamas has slaughtered, as has been pointed out, over 1,300 people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=268.12s)]
*  And it's not hyperbole. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=274.32s)]
*  It suggests slaughtered. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=275.6s)]
*  Slaughtered. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=277.32s)]
*  And including 31 Americans as part of that. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=278.88s)]
*  And they've taken scores of people hostage, including children. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=283.88s)]
*  You said, imagine what those children hiding from Hamas were thinking. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=289.48s)]
*  It's beyond my comprehension to be able to imagine what they're thinking. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=295.24s)]
*  Beyond my comprehension. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=299.52s)]
*  They're committed evils and atrocities that make ISIS look somewhat more rational. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=301.88s)]
*  You know, Americans are grieving with you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  They really are. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  And Americans are worried. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=317.0s)]
*  Americans are worried because we know there's a — this is not an easy field to navigate, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=318.96s)]
*  what you have to do. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=324.88s)]
*  But the fact is that Israel, as they respond to these attacks, it seems to me that they [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=327.08s)]
*  have to continue to ensure that you have what you need to defend yourselves. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=335.84s)]
*  And we're going to make sure that occurs, as you know. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=342.4s)]
*  And we have to also bear in mind that Hamas does not represent all the Palestinian people. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=346.4s)]
*  And it has brought them only suffering. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=353.35999999999996s)]
*  You know, years ago, I asked the Secretary of State when he and I were working in the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=357.52s)]
*  Senate to write something for me, and he said — he wrote a line that I think is appropriate. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  He said, it's not — we lead not just — well, I won't go into it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=370.08s)]
*  I'll wait a later. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  But the point is this, that I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion at the hospital [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=379.12s)]
*  in Gaza yesterday. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=387.12s)]
*  And based on what I've seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=389.20000000000005s)]
*  you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=394.16s)]
*  But there's a lot of people out there who are not sure. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=395.88s)]
*  So we've got a lot — we've got to overcome a lot of things. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=398.56s)]
*  And it also means encouraging life-saving capacity to help the Palestinians who are [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=402.0s)]
*  innocent caught in the middle of this. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=408.56s)]
*  And — well, at any rate, that's who we are. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=412.32s)]
*  Not just me, but, I mean, that's who the United States is. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's just not the example or power. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=420.56s)]
*  It's the power or example that's almost as important. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=424.48s)]
*  The world's looking. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=428.56s)]
*  We — Israel has a value set like the United States does in other democracies. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=431.52s)]
*  And they're looking to see what we're going to do. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=437.2s)]
*  So, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm very happy to be back in Israel with you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=441.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=447.04s)]
*  And I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=448.16s)]
*  here. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=454.24s)]
*  But thank you. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=455.36s)]
*  I want to say to the people of Israel, their courage, their commitment, their bravery is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  stunning. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=464.0s)]
*  It's really stunning. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=465.44s)]
*  I'm proud to be here. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=467.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=468.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=486.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, you just heard the U.S. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=495.2s)]
*  President speaking, sitting beside Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=497.28s)]
*  And Joe Biden said, or certainly underlined, that the U.S. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=503.35999999999996s)]
*  will provide whatever support Israel needs. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=509.12s)]
*  He said, the world is watching. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=511.44s)]
*  Israel has a set of values like the U.S. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=514.0s)]
*  has, and it is important that they stick to those. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=516.48s)]
*  I want to bring back CNN's White House correspondent, Alex Sines, in Washington. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=521.04s)]
*  And I think the words that we heard from President Biden there go a long way to addressing what [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=524.64s)]
*  you and I have been discussing in the last hour or so. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=532.64s)]
*  The delicacy with which Joe Biden will need to walk a line here, given what happened in [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=536.4s)]
*  Gaza last night with the attack on the hospital, hundreds of people died while he said, you [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=545.52s)]
*  know, I understand that there is some confusion as to, you know, who was behind that attack. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=552.24s)]
*  He was pretty emphatic that, you know, that we need to sort of calm things down at this [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  point. This is difficult, isn't it, for Joe Biden? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=566.1600000000001s)]
*  Arlette. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=568.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very complicated and dynamic situation that the president is trying to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=569.44s)]
*  navigate at this moment. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  He made this trip to Israel with the intent of trying to show that steadfast support that [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=575.52s)]
*  the U.S. is ready to commit to Israel as it wages its war against Hamas. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=581.6s)]
*  You heard the president saying there that the U.S. stands ready to offer support to the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=585.76s)]
*  country, as well as the president trying to make this symbolic show of force to the Israeli [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=591.04s)]
*  people. You saw him on the tarmac is embracing Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=596.4s)]
*  You see him side by side with him, vowing that the U.S. will continue to support him. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=601.28s)]
*  But the president also made some points about the future of this war, as well as talking about [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pPYC_cc9DY&t=606.8s)]
