# Thousands of Palestinians flee south on foot as Israel steps up offensive in Gaza City
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw)
*  Breaking news we're following right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=0.0s)]
*  The Pentagon now says U.S. forces have carried out an airstrike against a weapons facility [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=1.48s)]
*  in Syria linked to various groups backed by Iran. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=7.34s)]
*  Seeing as Jeremy Diamond is joining us from Tel Aviv, Israel right now, he's got the latest. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=11.76s)]
*  What are you learning, Jeremy? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=16.4s)]
*  That's right, Wolf. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Two U.S. F-15s striking a weapons storage facility in eastern Syria. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  This was just confirmed by the U.S. Department of Defense. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=26.86s)]
*  This happened in response to attacks carried out by Iranian proxies in the region against [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=30.58s)]
*  U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=35.22s)]
*  We have watched over the last several weeks as Iranian proxies have ramped up their attacks [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=37.54s)]
*  on U.S. personnel and bases in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=42.94s)]
*  Since October 17th, 40 times those bases have been attacked by those Iranian proxies, leaving [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=47.42s)]
*  multiple U.S. service members with traumatic brain injuries and other injuries that the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=53.86s)]
*  military characterized as minor. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=58.5s)]
*  But this is just an ongoing saga in the potential for greater escalation here as Iran has employed [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=60.82s)]
*  its proxies to attack not only Israel but also U.S. interests in the region. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=66.14s)]
*  Earlier today, in fact, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, who are also allied with Iran, took [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=70.7s)]
*  down an unmanned U.S. aerial drone, which is another significant move in this story [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=76.7s)]
*  as we watch to see whether or not this conflict between Israel and Hamas could potentially [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  escalate into a broader regional war, which the U.S. is very much trying to avoid. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=88.62s)]
*  Yes, it certainly is, but it's a very serious development indeed. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=92.54s)]
*  We're also getting, and I know you're doing a lot of reporting on this, a new look inside [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=95.66s)]
*  Israel's ground offensive that's ongoing in Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=100.22s)]
*  What are you learning? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=103.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=105.42s)]
*  Well, if we went into Gaza on Saturday with the Israel Defense Forces and today several [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=106.42s)]
*  other journalists, including Reuters, getting an opportunity to go inside. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=110.78s)]
*  These are very tightly controlled visits, very limited window, and military sensors [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=114.02s)]
*  do review footage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  But we are getting a picture in this case of northern Gaza and some of Israel's military [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=120.3s)]
*  operations. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=124.78s)]
*  This is all happening as Israeli forces are moving now into the heart of Gaza City, according [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=125.78s)]
*  to Israel's Minister of Defense. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=130.6s)]
*  For several days now, we've been hearing that they've been encircling Gaza City, and now [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=133.22s)]
*  they are saying that they are firmly operating within that city, a Hamas stronghold. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=136.46s)]
*  Of course, it's very difficult for us to independently verify those accounts by the Israeli military. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=140.9s)]
*  But all of this is happening as senior Israeli officials are making very clear, Wolf, that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=146.16s)]
*  the tunnel system that remains below Gaza remains a tremendous challenge for Israeli [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=152.58s)]
*  forces. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=157.82s)]
*  The Israel Defense Force is confirming that they have taken out 130 tunnel systems since [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=159.7s)]
*  this war began. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=165.82s)]
*  But of course, they acknowledge that many, many more still remains. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=167.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, Wolf, remains dire. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=170.82s)]
*  We are watching as hospitals are running out of medical supplies, running out of fuels [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=174.42s)]
*  to carry out their operations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  And the U.N. Secretary General is warning that the way Israel is carrying out its military [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=179.9s)]
*  operations, saying that there is clearly something wrong there. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=184.42s)]
*  Wolf. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=187.42s)]
*  David Cormand reporting from Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  I want to get some more now on the crisis in Gaza as countless Palestinians flee the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  Israeli bombardment in the northern strip for an uncertain future in the south. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=195.61999999999998s)]
*  CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has a closer look at their harrowing journey. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=200.7s)]
*  Taking only what they can carry, families are fleeing Gaza City. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=207.06s)]
*  They wave white flags made of anything they can find. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=212.45999999999998s)]
*  And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocents. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=217.74s)]
*  Now we're supposed to be in the safe area, but you can hear the bombs behind us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=225.9s)]
*  He says all of our houses are gone. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=230.12s)]
*  Nothing is left. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=235.9s)]
*  part of the strip to move southwards, most recently opening what it called safe corridors [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=240.02s)]
*  for limited windows of time, pushing thousands here to Salah al-Din Street, where evacuees [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=246.38s)]
*  describe a harrowing journey. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=253.22s)]
*  We saw along the road destruction, dead bodies everywhere, and the Israeli tanks would demand [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=256.58s)]
*  to search the youth. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=261.94s)]
*  She says we saw one young man stripped naked. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=263.22s)]
*  We witnessed unbearable scenes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=266.74s)]
*  The only way to reach the route is by foot or by cart for those who can find room. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=271.06s)]
*  There was heavy shelling on our neighborhood and we were forced to flee. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=278.9s)]
*  We have to use these donkey carts because there's no fuel, he says. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=281.98s)]
*  They cut everything off to force us out of our homes. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=285.82s)]
*  Israeli troops are now in the heart of Gaza City. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=290.54s)]
*  As Israel's defense minister apparently declared the entire city, the whole of the enclave's [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=293.86s)]
*  largest population center, a legitimate target. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  Gaza is the biggest terrorist stronghold that mankind has ever built. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=304.5s)]
*  This whole city is one big terror base. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=308.17999999999995s)]
*  Underground, they have kilometers of tunnels connecting to hospitals and schools. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  The UN calls this exodus forcible displacement and accuses Israel of the collective punishment [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=315.61999999999995s)]
*  of some two million people. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=321.94s)]
*  And these routes can be dangerous and deadly. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  This was Salah ad-Din Street just a few weeks ago. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=328.58s)]
*  CNN geolocated and authenticated these videos showing the aftermath of explosions [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=331.94s)]
*  that killed evacuees. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=337.38s)]
*  You can see luggage among the bodies. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=339.06s)]
*  And many fear they will never be allowed to return home. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=343.86s)]
*  Some here say this is reminiscent of the Nakba, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=347.86s)]
*  the Arabic term for the expulsion of Palestinians from their towns during the founding of Israel. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=351.21999999999997s)]
*  We walked a very long way. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=357.38s)]
*  It felt like the Nakba of 2023. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=359.06s)]
*  She says we walked by dead people who were ripped to shreds. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=361.7s)]
*  Children were very tired because there was no water. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=365.14000000000004s)]
*  People were dying and there were elderly who couldn't walk. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=367.7s)]
*  And for those who do make it, bombardment and siege await them in the south too. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=372.18s)]
*  There is no true escape. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=378.82s)]
*  And thanks to Sira Salma Abdelaziz for that report. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N5Vu_28aNw&t=383.06s)]
