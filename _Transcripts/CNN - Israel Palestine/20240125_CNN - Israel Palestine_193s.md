# Alleged leaked Netanyahu audio reveals he might be angry with the US
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc)
*  During a testy meeting with hostage families Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=0.0s)]
*  appears to have strained his one regional relationship with Qatar that matters most [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=6.8s)]
*  to those very families. You don't hear me thinking Qatar because Qatar is essentially [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  no different from the UN or the Red Cross and in some ways even more problematic. They have [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=19.92s)]
*  leverage because they're financing them. These comments, caught off mic, triggered a rapid and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=26.0s)]
*  barbed diplomatic put down from Qatari officials who helped negotiate the release of almost 100 [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=32.72s)]
*  Israeli hostages in November saying in a tweet, we are appalled by the alleged remarks attributed [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=40.08s)]
*  to the Israeli Prime Minister if validated are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=47.28s)]
*  save innocent lives but are not surprising. Just days earlier, Qatar had been talking up [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=54.24s)]
*  relations with Israel and the potential for Hamas to release more hostages. We are engaging in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  serious discussions with both sides. We have presented ideas to both sides. We are getting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=70.08s)]
*  a constant stream of replies from both sides. Qatar's frustration now seems personal with [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=75.68s)]
*  Netanyahu. Qatar concluding their criticism with a view increasingly suspected by some Israelis. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=81.68s)]
*  Netanyahu wants to keep the war going saying in a tweet, the Israeli Prime Minister would only be [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=90.0s)]
*  obstructing and undermining the mediation process for reasons that appear to serve his political [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=97.68s)]
*  career. Hostage families who were in the meeting with the Prime Minister released a terse statement [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=104.0s)]
*  appearing to blame Netanyahu for the leak although he denies it. The fact that the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=111.52s)]
*  censorship was given permission to publish this audio recording is serious and indicates a loss [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=118.08s)]
*  of judgment. This leaked audio also suggests he may be trying to draw the White House into confrontation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=126.48s)]
*  I was very angry recently and I didn't hide it from the Americans that they renewed the contract [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=135.04s)]
*  on the military base they have with Qatar. President Biden hasn't openly spoken to the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=139.76s)]
*  tensions but this week Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticizing Israel for taking [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=145.44s)]
*  Gazan territory to create a security buffer. We've been very clear about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=152.32s)]
*  maintaining in effect the territorial integrity. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=158.88s)]
*  And to that point has Qatar actually decided to possibly pull out of the mediation talks? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  There's absolutely no indication that they're going to do that. Indeed, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  CIA Chief Bill Burns is on his way to meetings with his Israeli counterpart Egyptian officials [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=174.4s)]
*  and yes Qatari officials as well and that is all about trying to get those remaining [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=179.44s)]
*  hostages released Jake. Nick Robertson in Tel Aviv for us this evening. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=185.44s)]
*  Nick Robertson in Tel Aviv for us. Thank you so much. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9c0117-HNc&t=189.68s)]
