# Video shows massive overnight explosions in Beirut
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY)
*  New evacuation orders are in effect in Lebanon's capital as Israel's military vows to keep hitting Hezbollah targets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=0.0s)]
*  Lebanese authorities report dozens of people were killed on Thursday, more than 1,400 in the past few weeks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=7.44s)]
*  And we're following a brand new development. Lebanon says an Israeli strike on a key border crossing with Syria has cut off access to the international road. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=13.84s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting in Lebanon have used the crossing over the past few weeks. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=22.88s)]
*  That video you're seeing there is from Beirut. A source tells CNN the IDF targeted Hashem Safiadeen with a strike on the Lebanese capital. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=30.0s)]
*  He's seen as a possible successor to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an airstrike last week. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=46.96s)]
*  Now his fate is unclear. Israel says it struck Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut and killed several Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=53.84s)]
*  The IDF says its goal is to eliminate Hezbollah's threat to the residents of northern Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=62.72s)]
*  We will not allow Hezbollah to settle itself in these places in the future. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=70.4s)]
*  The severe blows against Hezbollah in all areas in Beirut, in the Beqa Valley, in south Lebanon will continue. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=74.48s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes in Lebanon. The UN says about 160,000 have crossed into Syria. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=82.88s)]
*  Humanitarian agencies say shelters are full and overflowing, and health workers say they're overwhelmed. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=90.88s)]
*  CNN's Ivan Watson is standing by with more on the growing refugee crisis. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=97.36s)]
*  But first, Paula Hancocks with the latest on Israel's military campaign. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=102.4s)]
*  And Paula, on the targeting of Nasrallah's possible successor, what are we learning? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=106.16s)]
*  Yes, so Kim, this was an Israeli airstrike which targeted Nasrallah's cousin. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=112.16s)]
*  He was also considered to be a potential key successor to Nasrallah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=121.84s)]
*  Hashem Safiadeen, he was the head of the executive council within Hezbollah as well. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=127.6s)]
*  So a very key figure that many had assumed could well take over the reins of Hezbollah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=133.52s)]
*  Now, we know at this point that there was a significant airstrike against him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=139.76s)]
*  The Israelis saying that they were targeting him. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=144.56s)]
*  We do not know at this point, though, whether or not he was killed in that strike itself. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=147.6s)]
*  Hezbollah always does admit and acknowledge when its fighters and its members are killed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  So we'll wait to hear about that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=160.32s)]
*  We do know that 37 Lebanese were killed in the past 24 hours and some 151 were injured. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=162.16s)]
*  There were more airstrikes overnight within the southern suburbs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=172.4s)]
*  There were some evacuation orders given by the Israeli military saying that they were [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=177.44s)]
*  going to target particular buildings and that people should move about 500 meters away from [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=182.16s)]
*  those buildings. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  But many of those evacuation orders came during the night when potentially many people were sleeping. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, we've heard from the Israeli military that this will continue. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=195.12s)]
*  You heard from the IDF chief there saying that they have to destroy Hezbollah's capabilities [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  along the border to make sure that tens of thousands of Israelis can move back to their [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=203.44s)]
*  homes in northern Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=208.0s)]
*  Of course, this has moved far beyond the border. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=209.68s)]
*  This is in Beirut, the capital, as well. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  They are still claiming it is a localized and a limited operation, but we do know that at least [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=215.12s)]
*  one other battalion has moved from the south to the northern border and that could potentially [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=221.44s)]
*  be about 10,000 more soldiers. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=226.72s)]
*  So the skepticism of Israel saying it was limited now appears to be realized. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=228.72s)]
*  Kim? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=233.44s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=234.24s)]
*  And Ivan, obviously Israel's attacks are having a devastating effect on the civilians there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  What more can you tell us? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=240.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=242.24s)]
*  Well, Kim, the Lebanese Red Cross has just put out an urgent appeal for blood donations. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=242.56s)]
*  This is as the number of casualties continues to grow. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=248.24s)]
*  The World Health Organization says that, for example, in the last 24 hours alone, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=252.24s)]
*  some 28 health care workers have been killed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=257.92s)]
*  They say that in Beirut, three hospitals have been forced to fully evacuate staff and patients, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  and two others were partially evacuated. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=267.92s)]
*  And meanwhile, in the south of Lebanon, at least 37 health facilities have been closed. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=270.56s)]
*  Take a listen to a nurse at a hospital in Beirut, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=276.56s)]
*  what he has to say about the kind of injuries he's seeing coming into that hospital doors. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=280.48s)]
*  The cases coming to the hospital are sometimes beyond what we can handle. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=289.36s)]
*  They are so terrifying and horrifying. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=293.04s)]
*  Some with the hand blown off, others with the leg gone, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=295.36s)]
*  some with their heads blown off. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=299.12s)]
*  There are stories that are so heartbreaking that even a stone would cry. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=300.8s)]
*  Now, we also need to acknowledge that there are more than a million people in Lebanon who've been [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  displaced by the Israeli onslaught, starting from the southern areas when the Israeli bombardment [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=311.92s)]
*  first began, and now people fleeing from places like the densely populated southern suburbs [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=319.12s)]
*  of Beirut as well. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=325.12s)]
*  Now, we've just heard from a Lebanese government minister that the main road leading up to the main [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=326.8s)]
*  border crossing, land border crossing between Lebanon and Syria has been hit and that road has [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=334.8s)]
*  been cut off. We don't know how long that is going to last for. Western governments are trying to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=342.72s)]
*  evacuate their citizens. They're trying to arrange additional flights for ordinary Lebanese who don't [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=349.36s)]
*  have the means or the visas to travel to other countries or can't squeeze themselves onto one of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=355.04s)]
*  these sold out flights. The Syrian border is the only real land border that people can escape through. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=360.32s)]
*  More than 160,000 people have crossed through there in just the last about two weeks, and now [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  that appears to be closed. And, you know, in full transparency, Kim, my own in-laws, who are all [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=371.6s)]
*  displaced from their homes by the Israeli bombardment, were considering, we were discussing [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=377.76s)]
*  the possibility that they might try to escape the deadly Israeli bombardment, aerial bombardment, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=382.96s)]
*  to try to go through Syria to Jordan. That now, that door appears to have closed, and people are [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  being stuck while fleeing their homes inside Lebanon. A big difference between what has [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=395.2s)]
*  happened in Lebanon and in Gaza with the Israeli assault there for nearly a year that has killed [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=401.28s)]
*  more than 40,000 Palestinians is Gaza is so much smaller. Lebanon is a much larger country, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=406.64s)]
*  but civilian families are frightened and looking for places to hide from these deadly aerial [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=413.36s)]
*  bombardments. As soon as Fred Plankin is following that live from Berlin, it's interesting, isn't it, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=419.76s)]
*  Fred, seeing the response there, but also anticipating what he might say. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=424.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And I think it certainly is no coincidence, Max, that the supreme leader, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=431.36s)]
*  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is leading those Friday prayers today. The last time that he actually did [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=435.52s)]
*  that was in 2020, when a U.S. airstrike, of course, killed the then commander of the Islamic [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=439.91999999999996s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, of course, was very important to Iran's military [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=444.88s)]
*  apparatus. And so now, as far as those memorial services for Hassan Nasrallah, as far as these, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  as part of these Friday prayers is concerned, the supreme leader once again today will be on the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  scene to speak at these Friday prayers. And we can already see, we have some of the shots there, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=462.72s)]
*  just how large the crowds are that have turned out so far. I've been at that facility many times [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=466.72s)]
*  for Friday prayers. I have not ever seen a crowd of that size. In fact, I think the last time that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=472.72s)]
*  there was a crowd of that size was probably the funeral for Qassem Soleimani. And one of the things [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=477.04s)]
*  that we have to keep in mind, Max, is that the bond between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Hassan [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=482.0s)]
*  Nasrallah was a lot stronger than I think many people realize. So one of the things that we have [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=486.96s)]
*  to keep in mind is that between Qassem Soleimani, the slain general, Hassan Nasrallah and Ayatollah [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  Ali Khamenei, there was a major bond that was formed during the time of the Israeli incursion [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  into Lebanon in 2006. In fact, the three wrote a book together later with a massive part of that [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=504.56s)]
*  book dealing with that 2006 incursion. So certainly there was a very special place for Hassan Nasrallah [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=510.0s)]
*  with the supreme leader. Certainly there was a lot of support, of course, also from Iran for [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=516.32s)]
*  Hezbollah. And the Iranians are saying that that continues. And of course, we did have that major [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=520.6400000000001s)]
*  strike on Israeli territory by the Iranians happening not after the Hamas leader, Ismail [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=525.84s)]
*  Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran, but after Hassan Nasrallah was then also killed in Beirut. And I [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=531.7600000000001s)]
*  think the Iranians are showing just how big a thing the killing of Hassan Nasrallah was for them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  And of course, the Iranians also trying to display the power of their missile forces that they have. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=542.56s)]
*  And one of the interesting caveats in all of this is also is that the same department of the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps that's responsible for Iran's missile force is also responsible for Iran's [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=554.56s)]
*  air defense systems, which of course right now are on high alert as the Iranians anticipate some sort [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=560.9599999999999s)]
*  of Israeli response that could happen. Of course, there are people who've been talking about possibly [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=566.4s)]
*  the nuclear facilities of Iran being under threat, but then also oil and gas installations as well. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  In any case, I would say right now that Iran's surface-to-air missile system is certainly [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=576.08s)]
*  on high alert. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGYcI4DXyY&t=580.48s)]
