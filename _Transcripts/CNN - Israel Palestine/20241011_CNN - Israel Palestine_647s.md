# Explosions hit UN headquarters in Lebanon for the second day in a row as international concern grows
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8)
*  The reality on the ground, of course, anything but de-escalation at this point. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=0.0s)]
*  The United Nations sounding the alarm after its peacekeeping positions in southern Lebanon [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=4.8s)]
*  were hit twice in 48 hours. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=10.48s)]
*  Now, the latest incident happening Friday morning with two peacekeepers injured in explosions [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=13.44s)]
*  close to a UN observer tower that just hours after the UN's peacekeeping chief said the safety of UN [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=19.2s)]
*  peacekeepers in Lebanon was increasingly in jeopardy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=26.08s)]
*  A UN observation post was hit by Israeli tank fire on Thursday. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=30.32s)]
*  That incident, which also injured two peacekeepers, sparked condemnation from several countries. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=34.56s)]
*  Well, the UNIFIL spokesperson, and that is the UN peacekeeping force on the ground, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=41.76s)]
*  the spokesperson, Andrea Tenenti, joining me now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  And so it's good to speak to you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  I have to ask, what are the details of the incident today? What happened? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=53.6s)]
*  The last 48 hours have been highly concerning because of the incidents. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=60.32s)]
*  Three yesterday, three positions were hit by the IDF yesterday. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=64.4s)]
*  Today, one position inside our main headquarters in Nakura was hit by, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=68.88s)]
*  and two peacekeepers were injured, one more seriously. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=75.92s)]
*  In relation to the last incident of today, we are still very fine with the responsibilities. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=80.08s)]
*  It's still not 100% clear, so we don't want to start giving responsibilities to what happened [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=84.72s)]
*  today, yesterday, and the day before. There were three clearly IDF hits in our positions. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=91.44s)]
*  Two injured yesterday and two our bases. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=98.72s)]
*  Hit by what, sir? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=101.12s)]
*  Well, one was- [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  Hit by what? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=104.64s)]
*  Yes, the one where two peacekeepers were injured yesterday was a tank, a Markava tank. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=106.32s)]
*  And the other bases, there were also shelling but drones, and one camera was hit and also [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=113.44s)]
*  illumination of the base. And the drone was very close also to the bunkers where our peacekeepers [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=122.72s)]
*  were sheltering. Today, for the incident of today, we really need to verify before [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=128.32s)]
*  giving more information. But definitely it's very worrying because few days ago, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=133.68s)]
*  the IDF told us to move from positions close to the blue line. And we have 29 positions [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=137.84s)]
*  along the blue line, but the decision was taken to stay. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=143.6s)]
*  The IDF put out a statement after the incident yesterday claiming Hezbollah operates near these [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  UNIFIL posts. Do they? And are you concerned UNIFIL troops could be at risk from further attacks [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=156.32s)]
*  at this point? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=165.84s)]
*  Well, the attack inside our compound, the main headquarters of UNIFIL, it's pretty clearly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=167.6s)]
*  marked area position is the largest one. And the tower is pretty far from anything else. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  Hitting also the cameras of a position, I don't know how much has to do with [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=182.4s)]
*  other fighting force in the area. And the same thing for illumination and having a drone going [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  close to the bunkers where peacekeepers are. So very difficult to understand why it happened. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  We are still asking for clarifications. And we said that this development is not only serious, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=201.84s)]
*  but it's also a violation of international humanitarian law and Resolution 1701. So it's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=207.36s)]
*  very serious also because, as I said, we were asked to move, but we decided to stay because [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=214.08s)]
*  it's important to keep an international presence in the region. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  If this escalates, will you have to take the decision to move? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  The decision will be taken not by the mission, but by the Security Council. The Security Council [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  asked us to be here. We were deployed because of Resolution 1701 by the Security Council. And the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=235.76s)]
*  Security Council will need to decide. At the moment we are staying, it's important not only [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  to be present, but it's also important to ensure humanitarian assistance to the population. There [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=245.84s)]
*  are still thousands of people that are stuck in villages with very little left. So this is another [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  relevant role that we are trying to play together with UN agencies, assisting UN agencies to reach [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=257.68s)]
*  certain areas that now they're very difficult to reach. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=263.84s)]
*  Part of the UNIFIL statement said, and I quote, any deliberate attack on peacekeepers [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=269.52s)]
*  is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and of the Security Council Resolution 1701 [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=276.64s)]
*  that you've just referred to. Do you, in reading that, that seems to suggest, but I want to just [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=284.08s)]
*  confirm this with you, is, do you see these as deliberate attacks on UNIFIL? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=291.28s)]
*  We also mentioned in our statement yesterday that was a deliberate attack, for sure, the position [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=301.2s)]
*  where the cameras was it and the illumination of the base was it. So we mentioned clearly that it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=307.28s)]
*  was a deliberate attack against our peacekeepers. Again, this is very serious, but what's important [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=313.04s)]
*  now is really to, not only to ensure the safety of our troops, but for the whole international [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  community to find a solution to this conflict. Because what's happening right now is not only [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=328.48s)]
*  a conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, this conflict can really expand and become a real [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=333.76s)]
*  regional conflict. And everybody has a responsibility at this moment to try to find [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=339.92s)]
*  solutions to prevent a disaster or catastrophe to happen in the region. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=345.92s)]
*  How many peacekeepers have been injured and what is their state at this point? Where are they [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  and how are they? Well, in the last 48 hours, we had four peacekeepers injured. Two yesterday, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=361.20000000000005s)]
*  they were not seriously injured. And two today, one is seriously injured in a hospital with [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=368.08s)]
*  sharpening in the stomach. So it's more a serious situation. So four peacekeepers in the last [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=373.52s)]
*  40, 48 hours. And definitely this is a very high concern for the mission and for the international [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=379.35999999999996s)]
*  community. Yeah. So I have to say there will be people watching this show who see the term [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=388.08s)]
*  peacekeeper as an oxymoron at this pace, given what we have just been discussing, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=394.72s)]
*  given that there have been discriminant attacks on the UNIFIL positions. What is the point of [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=400.16s)]
*  UNIFIL being there at this point? There is no peacekeeping work going on, is there? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=409.04s)]
*  It's very challenging. Our monitoring capabilities are very limited, but I just want to put to the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=416.48s)]
*  public the idea of what would be the south of Lebanon right now without anyone, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=422.24s)]
*  no international community at all, not 10,500 peacekeepers. I understand the limitation we [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=427.04s)]
*  have at the moment, but no one, no one reporting to the Security Council as little as we can right [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=432.64s)]
*  now, but we're still reporting and also assisting local communities. That's the most important part, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=438.32s)]
*  the conflicting activities that can bring assistance to thousands of people in the south [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=443.68s)]
*  of Lebanon. I think it's still relevant. Difficult, challenging, but still relevant. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=448.88s)]
*  We've read out part of an IDF statement. I am seeing a number of statements being posted by [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=457.92s)]
*  members of the IDF from some of their press departments. What sort of contact do you have [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=464.8s)]
*  with the IDF at present? Are you in direct contact with the IDF? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=473.2s)]
*  Yes, the communication channel is still open and that's what's important. That's the positive part. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=482.08s)]
*  The head of mission and force commander of UNIFIL, General Lazzaro, is still in touch. The [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=487.68s)]
*  communication channel is always open and not only with the IDF but also with the Lebanese authorities. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=493.44s)]
*  It's still aimed at de-escalating the situation. But as I said, the situation is very difficult [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=501.12s)]
*  right now. Challenging monitoring capabilities is very limited, but communication is still ongoing. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=507.76s)]
*  Right. Just how concerned are you? I'm going to close with this. Given that there is a clear goal [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=515.28s)]
*  by the IDF to go after Hezbollah assets wherever they are and they have been warning residents [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=522.96s)]
*  across southern Lebanon to get out if they are close to Hezbollah assets or infrastructure. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=530.56s)]
*  We've been reporting it is almost impossible for civilians to know whether or not they are [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=536.9599999999999s)]
*  anywhere close to Hezbollah assets and infrastructure. You have said, we've read out [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=544.88s)]
*  the IDF statement suggesting that there were Hezbollah assets or infrastructure close to or [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=552.2399999999999s)]
*  in the area where the UNIFIL units are. How much confidence do you have that you [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=558.0s)]
*  are going to continue to be a target at this point? I guess my point is very simple. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=569.36s)]
*  The IDF have made Hezbollah targets their target and as far as they are concerned it seems [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=576.64s)]
*  it seems your units are close to those targets. That must be a significant risk to you. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=584.08s)]
*  It's definitely a concern. It's a concern and we decided in coordination with all the other [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=593.84s)]
*  troop contributing countries at the moment to stay. It's also the responsibility and the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=598.96s)]
*  obligation of the parties to ensure the safety and security of our peacekeepers. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=604.64s)]
*  We are still here and we are still looking for a solution. The solution is there as we mentioned [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=610.1600000000001s)]
*  several times. The solution is the full implementation of 1701. 1701 is there. 1701, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=615.2800000000001s)]
*  the main provision is still valid. What we do not have is the commitment of the parties and the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  implementation is not up to the mission. It's up to the two countries. Definitely the concerns [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  are there but it's important again that international presence is there to de-conflict [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=632.8800000000001s)]
*  the situation and again to provide the much needed assistance which is also [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=638.24s)]
*  an important role and part of our role in the south of Lebanon. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yBJk1iOcO8&t=643.36s)]
