# CNN goes into underground tunnel that IDF claims was under Gaza cemetery
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE)
*  This is no ordinary quarry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=0.0s)]
*  It's where the living once buried their dead. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=3.0s)]
*  Gaza's Bani Sahela Cemetery, hollowed out by Israeli excavators. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=6.24s)]
*  These were all graves. This was a cemetery. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=11.68s)]
*  But the military says that they were forced to come in here [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=14.24s)]
*  because they discovered a Hamas tunnel running right underneath that cemetery. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=17.48s)]
*  But the Israeli military failed to prove that stunning claim [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=23.0s)]
*  during a three-hour tour of the area. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=27.0s)]
*  They invited us here a week after we first uncovered this graveyard's partial destruction [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=29.92s)]
*  using satellite imagery, part of a CNN investigation that found 16 cemeteries in Gaza [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  damaged or destroyed by the Israeli military. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=41.52s)]
*  This whole area here is a military compound. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=44.92s)]
*  From the mosque over there, underneath the graveyard, all the way down north and south. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=47.64s)]
*  My forces, at the beginning, we tried to flank this area, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=55.6s)]
*  we were fired from this area again and again and again. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=59.72s)]
*  We couldn't understand why. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=63.8s)]
*  So that's how you determined that there was a tunnel here because you were being fired upon? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=65.12s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=69.0s)]
*  Our journey to investigate the Israeli military's claims [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=70.84s)]
*  begins in the rubble of what they say was a residential building. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=74.36s)]
*  Even just standing at the mouth of this tunnel, you can feel the humidity just like emanating here. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=78.64s)]
*  And this is the way that we go in to what they say is an extensive tunnel system in Bani Suheila. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=83.4s)]
*  We descend into a dark, seemingly endless labyrinth. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=91.76s)]
*  There's just tight spaces like this in certain parts of this tunnel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=98.64s)]
*  But then you get here and you have full headspace, pretty much. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=103.6s)]
*  All throughout it, you can see that there's electricity, there's telecommunications. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=109.16s)]
*  The Israeli military says that this tunnel system actually leads to a Hamas command center, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=113.28s)]
*  which they say was used by Hamas fighters to coordinate their attacks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=118.24s)]
*  The Israeli military says this is that command center, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=123.8s)]
*  multiple rooms equipped with plumbing and electricity, maps like this once lining the walls. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=127.64s)]
*  You can see a kitchen here equipped with a sink running water, with the pipes running through the tunnel wall. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=134.6s)]
*  You have a fan, plates. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=141.76s)]
*  I mean, you could imagine this being in a house, but instead it's deep, deep underground. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=144.44s)]
*  Where are we right now? What's above us? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  So we're in the headquarters of a Hamas commander. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  Above us is a cemetery that I showed you from the outside. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=156.56s)]
*  If you look at the satellite imagery of this cemetery, there is a wide area that the military has cleared. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=161.44s)]
*  Why is that necessary in order to uncover these tunnels? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=166.28s)]
*  We have to reach the tunnels. We have to reach the tunnels. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  We have to uncover the tunnels. We have to prevent from the enemy to flank us. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  But there's no way for us to verify whether we are actually beneath the graveyard. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  General Goldfuss takes us back out of the tunnel, but not into the cemetery. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  Instead, we leave the same way we came in, before walking back to the enormous hole where the cemetery once stood. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  Please hold on a second. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=197.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  We're asking the general if we can actually see the shaft to the tunnel, but the answer is no. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  So? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=209.84s)]
*  There's all kinds of machinery which I don't want you to just take pictures of. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  The security might force it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=214.96s)]
*  What about if we don't film it? We just look with our eyes? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=216.32s)]
*  There's no security and then you might fall in. The whole thing can collapse. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  You have to walk to the edge. The edge is not secured. It can collapse. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  There's machinery, so on. It's not something I'm going to take a risk on. Sorry. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=226.04s)]
*  The Israeli military later provided this drone footage, showing the tunnel shaft we entered and another one nearby. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=231.39999999999998s)]
*  CNN geolocated the footage using this satellite image. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  This outline shows where the cemetery once stood, and these are the two tunnel entrances, clearly outside the graveyard. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  As for the tunnel they say they found here, where the cemetery once stood, the military never provided any evidence. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34CxzZtVxnE&t=251.12s)]
