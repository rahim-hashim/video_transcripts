# Hear what Bernie Sanders thinks about Israel's response to Hamas attack
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q)
*  Across the U.S. this weekend, large crowds of pro-Palestinian protesters took to city streets to call for a ceasefire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=0.0s)]
*  And on Capitol Hill Friday, dozens of activists were arrested after entering the offices of several senators. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=7.44s)]
*  One of those senators is here with me now, Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=13.52s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for joining me this morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=17.92s)]
*  Four weeks ago, more than 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, were slaughtered in their homes and at a festival. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=20.56s)]
*  You've been critical of Israel's response recently. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=27.52s)]
*  How do you think Israel should be responding? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=30.8s)]
*  Well, this is what you've got. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  I think clear to most people. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=36.8s)]
*  What Hamas did, and Hamas is an awful terrorist organization, is they slaughtered 1,400 people in cold blood. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=38.08s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=45.6s)]
*  But what Israel does not, in my view, have a right to do is to kill thousands and thousands of innocent men, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=48.16s)]
*  women and children who had nothing to do with that attack. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=56.32s)]
*  So the immediate concern to my mind is we have got to stop the bombing now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=61.6s)]
*  You had over 600,000 people pushed out of their homes. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=67.76s)]
*  Where are they going? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=71.44s)]
*  They're staying in United Nations facilities overcrowded. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=72.32s)]
*  There's not enough water. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=76.48s)]
*  There's not enough food. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=77.44s)]
*  There's not enough medicine. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=78.32s)]
*  Not enough fuel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=79.52s)]
*  You've got a humanitarian disaster. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=80.4s)]
*  It has to be dealt with right now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=82.32s)]
*  So, Senator. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=84.32s)]
*  But the issue is... [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=84.96s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=86.96s)]
*  No, please. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, Donald. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  So what you're saying about the lack of food and water and so forth, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=88.96s)]
*  I think that most people in the West, certainly the U.S., believes that that is because Hamas is hoarding it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  And the other question is how does Israel destroy Hamas with that? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  It's not just that Hamas is hoarding it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=108.88s)]
*  They are. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  It's more than that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=112.0s)]
*  That's what Israeli's policy has been. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=112.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  So it's a combination of factors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=116.08s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  Let's get to the other point that you made, which is really the key one, which is innocent [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=118.63999999999999s)]
*  civilians dying. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=123.83999999999999s)]
*  And they are. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=124.72s)]
*  How should Israel destroy Hamas post-attack on these innocent civilians in Israel without [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=126.24s)]
*  hurting, killing innocent men, women, and children when Hamas is hiding behind them [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=134.88s)]
*  and putting them in danger? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=141.04s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=142.56s)]
*  That is exactly the right question to be asked the military experts, of which I am not one. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=144.96s)]
*  But clearly, yeah, they have Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=151.12s)]
*  Hamas has sworn. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=154.96s)]
*  That's what its goal is to destroy Israel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=156.96s)]
*  They got to deal with that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=158.96s)]
*  But there got to be a better way than killing thousands of men, women, and children. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=160.32s)]
*  So once again, the immediate concern is you got to have a pause in the bombing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=164.72s)]
*  You got to take care of the immediate disaster. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=170.8s)]
*  Israel's got to change its charging. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=173.28s)]
*  Let me just say this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=174.72s)]
*  The United States of America provides $3.8 billion every year to Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  We have a right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=182.08s)]
*  Israel can do what they want. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  They're an independent country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  But we have a right to say, sorry, you need a new military strategy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=185.28s)]
*  Go after Hamas. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=189.28s)]
*  But that means, but do not kill innocent men, women, and children. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned money. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=195.28s)]
*  There is going to be a measure before you relatively soon for the House passed more [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=196.56s)]
*  than $14 billion. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=203.2s)]
*  And there is going to be at least some version of that in the Senate. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=205.12s)]
*  Will you support that or will you put conditions on it? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, we'll see what the bill looks like. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  But I think it's terribly important that as we debate that to say to Israel, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=214.48s)]
*  you want this money, you got to change your military strategy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=217.92s)]
*  The other point is we have to give hope to the Palestinian people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=221.6s)]
*  They were living before October 7 in a disastrous situation in Gaza, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=226.0s)]
*  75% youth unemployment, massive poverty. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=230.56s)]
*  And right now in Israel, you're having the Netanyahu government, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=234.0s)]
*  an extreme right-wing government with racists aboard trying to make it impossible for two [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=237.68s)]
*  state solution in the West Bank. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=243.2s)]
*  They're killing settlers there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=244.96s)]
*  So what we need is the world to come together to give hope to the Palestinians. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=246.48s)]
*  We need a two-state solution. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=250.0s)]
*  And we need to have many of the very wealthy countries in the region, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  the United Arab Republic, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=257.36s)]
*  They are extraordinarily wealthy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=261.12s)]
*  Work with the United States, work with the community in order to provide some hope and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=263.12s)]
*  decency and freedom to the Palestinian people, which Hamas will never do. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=267.76s)]
*  You're right about that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=273.68s)]
*  They have a lot of money and they, to this point, have not been really willing to use that money [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=274.56s)]
*  in that region to help their fellow Arabs. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=280.64s)]
*  I want to just clarify one thing, Senator, if I might. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  You support a humanitarian pause in Gaza. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  Some of your fellow progressives say that there should be a full-on ceasefire, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=289.28s)]
*  which would require an agreement on both sides to halt the fighting. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=292.8s)]
*  Do you support a ceasefire? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=296.24s)]
*  And if not, why not? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=297.68s)]
*  Well, I don't know how you could have a ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  with an organization like Hamas, which is dedicated to turmoil and chaos [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=304.32s)]
*  and destroying the state of Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=310.48s)]
*  And I think what the Arab countries in the region understand, that Hamas has got to go. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  So what we need right now, the immediate task right now, is to end the bombing, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  to end the horrific humanitarian disaster, to build, go forward with the entire world [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=323.44s)]
*  for a two-tier, two-state solution to the crisis to give the Palestinian people hope. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=329.12s)]
*  Senator, Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib released a video on Friday. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=336.32s)]
*  I want you to watch part of it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=340.48s)]
*  Mr. President, the American people are not with you on this one. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=343.68s)]
*  We will remember in 2024. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=352.0s)]
*  That last screen said Joe Biden supported the genocide of the Palestinian people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  I know you know the definition of genocide. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=363.12s)]
*  It is defined as a crime committed with intent to destroy a national, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=365.2s)]
*  ethnic, racial, or religious group. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=370.24s)]
*  Do you think that's what Israel is doing here? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  What's going on right now is a horror show. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=374.8s)]
*  We don't have to quibble about words. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=377.44s)]
*  Thousands of men, women, and children are being killed. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=379.68s)]
*  It has got to end right now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=382.4s)]
*  And one of the things that concerns me, Donna, is there has not been enough talk [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=384.64s)]
*  about what right-wing Republicans are doing right now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=388.24s)]
*  They don't want any aid to go to the Palestinians. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=390.56s)]
*  Somebody should be talking about that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=393.04s)]
*  Somebody should be talking about how Trump wants to expel Palestinians from this country. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=395.12s)]
*  So you can disagree with Joe Biden, but on his worst day, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=401.36s)]
*  it will be 100 times better than where Trump and the right-wing Republicans are. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=405.2s)]
*  So you think that Rashida Tlaib should save her ire for Trump and the right wing, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=408.16s)]
*  and not her fellow Democrat? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=413.12s)]
*  Rashida is a friend of mine. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=415.2s)]
*  Her family comes from Palestine. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=416.96s)]
*  I think she has been shaken, as all of us are, about what goes on, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=418.48s)]
*  is going on right there, right now. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=422.24s)]
*  We have to address that humanitarian crisis. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=424.16s)]
*  But if anyone thinks that Trump is going to be better than Biden on this issue, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=426.64000000000004s)]
*  or any other issue for that matter, I think they are solely mistaken. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=431.84000000000003s)]
*  And I understand that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=436.16s)]
*  I also understand, and I know you know, that words matter. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=438.24s)]
*  And I want to ask about what she said. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  Look, words matter, but what matters more, Donna, is you have a horrible humanitarian disaster [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=444.32000000000005s)]
*  that has to be dealt with right now. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=451.6s)]
*  You call it whatever you want to call it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=453.04s)]
*  It has to be dealt with. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=454.8s)]
*  Women and children cannot be bombed with 2,000-pound bombs. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=455.84000000000003s)]
*  And we need the entire world community to stop that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=459.6s)]
*  So when she says, from the river to the sea, which the ADL says is anti-Semitic, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  she says it's aspirational, but the ADL says it is anti-Semitic, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=468.24s)]
*  do you want her to stop using terms like that? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think what, Donna, you know, it's not what I want or anything else. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=474.88s)]
*  President Obama just said the other day, I think quite correctly, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=481.35999999999996s)]
*  and we all got to deal with it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=484.32s)]
*  This is an enormously complex issue. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=485.44s)]
*  And slogans like the river to the sea, if that means the destruction of Israel, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=487.84s)]
*  that's not going to work. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=492.64s)]
*  People who are saying Israel right or wrong, we're for you all the way, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=493.84s)]
*  that's not going to work. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=497.28s)]
*  This is a horrendously complex issue. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=498.56s)]
*  Got a right-wing government in Israel, which is racist. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=500.64s)]
*  And the people, by the way, the good news is, last poll I saw, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=504.32s)]
*  only 18% of the people of Israel want Netanyahu to stay in office. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=507.28s)]
*  I hope they get rid of him. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  I hope they put in a government which understands the severity of the crisis [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=512.56s)]
*  and can help us move to the two-tiered state. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=516.48s)]
*  Senator. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=518.64s)]
*  And on the other hand, in terms of Hamas, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=518.9599999999999s)]
*  you got a terrorist organization that cannot be trusted for a minute. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=521.04s)]
*  This is, as President Obama said, a very complex issue. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=524.4s)]
*  Senator, real quick, and you're really alluding to this [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  in your answers and our discussion here. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=531.4399999999999s)]
*  You really are in a unique position, maybe even a difficult one, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=533.92s)]
*  because you're a leading progressive voice in American politics. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=536.88s)]
*  And you're also Jewish. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=540.88s)]
*  And you have family who died in the Holocaust. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=542.48s)]
*  How difficult is this for you? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=545.76s)]
*  This is not, it's nothing to do with me, Donna. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=548.88s)]
*  What this is is, as a nation, we are living now, in my view, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=551.76s)]
*  for a more difficult moment than we have lived in my lifetime. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=556.96s)]
*  You know, people are worried about the pandemic. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=560.56s)]
*  We're worried about climate change, worried about the attacks of democracy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=563.28s)]
*  Healthcare system is collapsing. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=566.72s)]
*  We have artificial information, which is going to, you know, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=569.9200000000001s)]
*  make radical changes to the economy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=572.72s)]
*  You got a crime all over this country. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=574.48s)]
*  People are worried and they're concerned. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=576.24s)]
*  All that I am begging people is to understand slogans are not going to do it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=577.84s)]
*  Social media is not going to do it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=582.08s)]
*  We need a serious discussion of how the hell we got out of this difficult situation. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=583.9200000000001s)]
*  Maintain democracy. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=588.24s)]
*  Bring peace to the world. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=589.36s)]
*  And it ain't easy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=592.08s)]
*  But slogans are not going to do it on any side. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=593.36s)]
*  Thank you, Donna. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=595.44s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for your time this morning. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=596.5600000000001s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=598.6400000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Donna. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYRmADgT1Q&t=601.2s)]
