# Protesters walk out of Jerry Seinfeld's commencement speech
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ)
*  The pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed college campuses have now found a new stage, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the graduation stage. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  At Duke University Sunday, about 30 students walked out of the commencement ceremony as [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=8.06s)]
*  comedian Jerry Seinfeld was being introduced. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=12.36s)]
*  Seinfeld has supported Israel throughout the war against Hamas in Gaza, and here is some [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=15.08s)]
*  of what he then said in his address. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=19.88s)]
*  I totally admire the ambitions of your generation to create a more just and inclusive society. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=23.44s)]
*  I think it is also wonderful that you care so much about not hurting other people's feelings. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=31.08s)]
*  In the million and one ways, we all do that every second of every day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=37.2s)]
*  It's lovely to want to fix those things. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  That is far from the only protest to hit college commencement ceremonies over the weekend, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  seen as Nick Valencia joins us now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=49.8s)]
*  That all happened, Nick. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=52.48s)]
*  Hey Kate, good morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  Commencement season is upon us, and these pro-Palestinian demonstrators are choosing [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=55.959999999999994s)]
*  to voice their opposition to the war in Gaza in a variety of ways, some continuing to call [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=59.31999999999999s)]
*  for a ceasefire. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=64.08s)]
*  Over the weekend, we saw that at commencement ceremonies across the country, really. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  Some chanted, others held signs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  Some draped themselves in Palestinian flags, calling for their schools to divest from Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=71.56s)]
*  For the most part, these ceremonies went on without a hitch. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=76.44s)]
*  In Southern California, though, there was a brief interruption. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=80.36s)]
*  According to the New York Times, at least one person was arrested over a skirmish outside [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=82.76s)]
*  of Pomona College's graduation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=87.36s)]
*  They had to move their graduation 30 miles away from their campus. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=89.7s)]
*  And at Duke University, we saw what happened there in the intro. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=93.96s)]
*  Comedian Jerry Seinfeld, who's been a very vocal supporter of Israel since the Hamas [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  terrorist attack on October 7th, he was protested by a few dozen pro-Palestinian demonstrators [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=101.3s)]
*  who chose to walk out and have their own commencement ceremony. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=106.86s)]
*  Across the country, in California, at UC Berkeley, the Dean of Students had to take the microphone. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=110.54s)]
*  There was a pause in ceremony there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=115.7s)]
*  And listen to what the Dean of Students had to say to try to get control again of that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=117.78s)]
*  graduation ceremony. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=121.66s)]
*  Students, if you're open to it, I invite you to speak with me after the event in a space [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=122.66s)]
*  that's more appropriate. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  But in the meanwhile, I ask that you allow the program to continue. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=136.42s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=144.42s)]
*  Because otherwise, we're going to have to continue to have you leave. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=148.42s)]
*  And that breaks my heart. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=152.42s)]
*  So... [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=154.42s)]
*  The ceremony did continue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=156.42s)]
*  No one was arrested. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=158.42s)]
*  And those demonstrators, we understand, did leave voluntarily. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=159.42s)]
*  More commencement addresses and graduation ceremonies are planned across the country [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=162.42s)]
*  this week. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=166.42s)]
*  And we're starting to see some schools try to get ahead of these potential demonstrations. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=167.42s)]
*  We're just learning the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has reached an agreement with pro-Palestinian [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=171.42s)]
*  demonstrators to dismantle their encampment by tomorrow. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=176.42s)]
*  In exchange, they've agreed not to interrupt a graduation ceremony. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=179.42s)]
*  In exchange, the university will join calls now for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=184.42s)]
*  Kate? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=189.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=190.42s)]
*  As college commencement ceremonies continue to do the protests, on Sunday, comedian Jerry [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=198.42s)]
*  Seinfeld was interrupted at Duke University's graduation ceremony. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=204.42s)]
*  In addition to receiving an honorary degree, Jerry is also serving as our commencement [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=209.42s)]
*  speaker today. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=215.42s)]
*  APPLAUSE [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=220.42s)]
*  Well, about 30 students walked out as the comedian was introduced. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=225.42s)]
*  You can see some students waving the Palestinian flag. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=228.42s)]
*  Here's how Seinfeld responded. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=231.42s)]
*  And I know all of you here are going to use all of your brains and muscle and soul to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=235.42s)]
*  improve the world, and I know you're going to do a bang-up job. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=240.42s)]
*  And when you're done, as I am now, I bet the world, because of you, will be a much [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=245.42s)]
*  better place. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=252.42s)]
*  But it will still not make a whole hell of a lot of sense. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=253.42s)]
*  And it is worth the sacrifice of an occasional discomfort to have some laughs. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=256.41999999999996s)]
*  Meanwhile, Pomona College in Southern California moved its ceremony more than 30 miles away [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  to avoid the pro-Palestinian protests on campus. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=270.41999999999996s)]
*  CNN's Camille Bernal has the story. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=273.42s)]
*  Many students and parents frustrated in this case because they have to drive 30 miles and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=277.42s)]
*  change their plans just to make sure that commencement goes on as planned. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=282.42s)]
*  So instead of it being in Pomona College, it's going to be here in LA at the Shrine [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=287.42s)]
*  Auditorium. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=291.42s)]
*  You can see it here behind me. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=292.42s)]
*  There are security measures already in place. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=293.42s)]
*  There is a barrier, a metal barrier, and already security guards who are not allowed inside [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=295.42s)]
*  the auditorium if you do not have a ticket. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=300.42s)]
*  The school apologizing and saying not only that this was an inconvenience, but also saying [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=303.42s)]
*  that they would provide transportation for the students to get here to Los Angeles. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=308.42s)]
*  Nonetheless, students just disappointed and say they're not happy about this whole change. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=313.42s)]
*  Take a listen to what one student said. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=318.42s)]
*  I think it's sad, and I think it's a really bad way to end your college career. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=320.42s)]
*  And I think it's showing exactly where Pomona is headed. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=326.42s)]
*  And some universities like Columbia and USC canceling altogether this big traditional [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=329.42s)]
*  commencement ceremony and instead making other plans, citing safety reasons and wanting to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=335.42s)]
*  avoid protests. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=341.42s)]
*  We saw students at Duke University walking out right as the commencement speaker was [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=342.42s)]
*  introduced. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=348.42s)]
*  That was Jerry Seinfeld. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=349.42s)]
*  He was able to give his address as planned with no apparent interruptions. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=350.42s)]
*  And this weekend at different universities, we saw students at UC Berkeley chanting and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=354.42s)]
*  protesting and briefly pausing the commencement ceremony. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=360.42s)]
*  They then walked out of that event and also at Virginia Commonwealth University, at least [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=364.42s)]
*  a dozen students also walking out when the governor was beginning to give his commencement [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=370.42s)]
*  address. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=376.42s)]
*  So again, that's what a lot of universities are trying to avoid this weekend and others [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=377.42s)]
*  who have events later on. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=382.42s)]
*  And of course, this has also caused just a lot of frustration among students who had [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=384.42s)]
*  to deal with graduating from high school in the middle of a pandemic and now again having [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=388.42s)]
*  to deal with commencement under difficult circumstances or under something that they [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=393.42s)]
*  do not consider a normal commencement ceremony. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=398.42s)]
*  Camille Labournal, CNN, Los Angeles. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIYS0H7J2SQ&t=401.42s)]
