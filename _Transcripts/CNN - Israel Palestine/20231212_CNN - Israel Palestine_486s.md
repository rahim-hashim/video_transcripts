# Biden warns that Netanyahu needs to change his government
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE)
*  This just in, a new candid message from President Biden on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=0.0s)]
*  At a fundraiser in Washington just a short while ago, Biden told donors that Israel is [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=5.92s)]
*  losing support around the world and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs to change [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=11.02s)]
*  his hardline government. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=16.76s)]
*  CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us from the White House. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=18.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=21.44s)]
*  These are pretty stark words from a president who has been in a robust way supportive of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=22.44s)]
*  what the Israeli government has been doing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right, Dana. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  These are very candid comments, perhaps President Biden's most candid comments about the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=33.92s)]
*  conflict between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=38.6s)]
*  The president made these comments at an off-camera closed-door fundraiser. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=40.92s)]
*  So we have a pool report that's offering some quotes from that. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=45.36s)]
*  And it said that President Biden had warned that Israel was beginning to lose support [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  amid its heavy bombardment of Gaza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=54.68s)]
*  The president suggested that it may be time for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  to change his government. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  The quotes say that Netanyahu has a tough decision to make and quote, this is the most [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  conservative government in Israel's history, Biden said, adding that the government doesn't [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=69.08s)]
*  want a two-state solution. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=73.24s)]
*  The president added that Israel was beginning to lose support around the world and said [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=75.24s)]
*  Netanyahu quote, has to strengthen and change the Israeli government. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=78.72s)]
*  But it does come, as you have seen President Biden very publicly stand shoulder to shoulder [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=82.88s)]
*  with Netanyahu. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=87.64s)]
*  But there have been some warnings specifically about the campaign in Gaza and the mounting [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=88.88s)]
*  civilian casualties. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  There's been widespread criticism about that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  And President Biden has warned Israel to take more caution to protect civilian life. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=98.88s)]
*  But these are certainly some of the president's most candid comments as he is warning that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=103.56s)]
*  Netanyahu is losing support around the world. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=109.84s)]
*  Our Latina reporters are back here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  Jeff Mason, to me, obviously, what Arlette was just reporting is kind of the headline [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=112.76s)]
*  that he warned that Israel is losing support. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=121.04s)]
*  But also the second quote, which explains maybe the first quote, this is the most conservative [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=124.76s)]
*  government in Israel's history, adding that the Israeli government doesn't want a two-state [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=131.88s)]
*  solution. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Am I reading too much into this to say that never mind the war, that the administration [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=139.04s)]
*  is and the president himself is starting to see a finish line for Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=145.92s)]
*  and kind of saying the quiet part out loud that maybe it's time for that government to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=152.76s)]
*  change, which people in Israel expect to happen after the war is over anyway? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=158.66s)]
*  I think they absolutely do. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=162.11999999999998s)]
*  And I don't think you're reading too much into it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  I think the Biden administration is focused on what happens when the war is over. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=164.64s)]
*  And you've heard the president and others in his administration talk about a two-state [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=168.52s)]
*  solution a lot in the last few weeks. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=171.72s)]
*  They want to be sure that there's somebody in place that actually supports that, and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=174.36s)]
*  this government doesn't. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  I think it's also telling that he said Israel is doing indiscriminate bombing over Gaza. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  And it comes after last night he had a reception at the White House for Hanukkah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=184.96s)]
*  And he gave an anecdote about having a picture taken with Bibi Netanyahu decades ago when [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=191.0s)]
*  they first met each other. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=195.8s)]
*  And he said, on the back of that picture, I wrote an inscription saying, I love you, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=197.8s)]
*  but I don't agree with anything you say. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  And he followed up by that, followed up with that last night saying, and that pretty much [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  applies today too. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=209.0s)]
*  So there's a shift. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=210.68s)]
*  And today the fundraiser comment and his comment last night is a signal of that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  And Paul Kane, you spend all your time on Capitol Hill where there certainly is a lot [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=216.36s)]
*  of support for Israel, bipartisan support, but there is a rift among the president's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=221.48s)]
*  own party. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=227.48s)]
*  Yeah, look, the Israel for Democrats is, I'm not comparing how the wars are being conducted [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=228.48s)]
*  and the players, but in terms of the politics, Israel for Democrats in some ways is becoming [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  like Ukraine for Republicans. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=241.67999999999998s)]
*  Their base, the Democratic base, is not happy with how Israel is conducting this war. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=245.28s)]
*  They're showing up at senators' offices here in Washington and back home. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=252.4s)]
*  They are showing up everywhere and protesting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=256.84s)]
*  And so right now they are the loudest voices on this issue in the Democratic coalition. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=259.4s)]
*  And Democratic lawmakers are reflecting that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=265.92s)]
*  And yet you have the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, as recently as Sunday, on with Jake [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  who has said for some time that Israel needs to be more careful when it comes to civilians [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=276.32s)]
*  and killing civilians as they try to root out Hamas, but also said again, he understands [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=283.11999999999995s)]
*  and the U.S. government understands that Israel is doing its best to root out Hamas and that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=290.28s)]
*  Hamas is using its own civilians as human shields. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=295.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=299.76s)]
*  They've been saying both things all along, which is they aren't going to tell Israel [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=300.76s)]
*  how to conduct this war, but then also saying that they need to make sure that they minimize [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=304.88s)]
*  civilian casualties, abide by the laws of war. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=310.92s)]
*  And they've stressed that over and over again. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=314.6s)]
*  And you can see that the president, as well as this White House, their patience is wearing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=316.72s)]
*  thin because they feel as though they've been saying that privately, publicly, in the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=320.92s)]
*  conversations that the president has with Netanyahu. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=326.0s)]
*  He has said this. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=329.64s)]
*  And yet it appears as though Israel is not really listening to the White House. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=330.88s)]
*  Yeah, the president is clearly looking for a finish line. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=335.4s)]
*  And that finish line, the White House does not believe includes Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  Netanyahu on the top of the Israeli government. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=342.76s)]
*  Really, really interesting development. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=345.79999999999995s)]
*  The UN is again debating whether to demand a ceasefire on Gaza. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  CNN's Nick Robertson is tracking that story for us. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  Nick, so the UN General Assembly appears set to demand a vote for an immediate ceasefire [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=354.76s)]
*  this days after the Security Council failed to agree on a similar call because of a U.S. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=359.92s)]
*  veto. Walk us through what this vote may mean. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=364.84s)]
*  Yeah, immediate ceasefire and immediate unconditional humanitarian access into Gaza as [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=369.76s)]
*  well. Those will be the same two demands expected as were pushed on Friday, rejected by [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=376.08s)]
*  that veto by the United States. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  Security Council. So this is the General Assembly, one hundred and ninety three nations able [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=383.76000000000005s)]
*  to vote. And I think a lot of people will be watching to see how the needle has shifted [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=389.92s)]
*  in opinion about Israel, because this is a nonbinding vote. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=395.76000000000005s)]
*  It needs a two third majority to pass and it may well pass, but it doesn't mean it's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  going to come into effect. There's no enforcement. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=406.56s)]
*  So this really becomes a measure of trying to the UN General Assembly, if you will, trying [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=408.72s)]
*  to send an even stronger message to Israel. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=413.48s)]
*  Back in October, there was a vote along along broadly similar terms, but one hundred and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=416.12s)]
*  twenty one voted for fourteen against forty four abstentions. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=421.56s)]
*  So if the number of votes for this immediate ceasefire and immediate humanitarian access [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=426.8s)]
*  goes up, then that shows that the dial is shifting in pressure on Israel. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=432.92s)]
*  Will it make a difference to Israel? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=438.76s)]
*  Well, potentially not. But there's a real desperate effort on the way to try to find [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  ways internationally now to signal to Israel that that this cannot continue in regards to [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=445.32s)]
*  the high civilian casualty toll, the desperate and worsening humanitarian situation [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=451.04s)]
*  cannot continue. And that's that is in essence what this vote will be about because it [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=456.68s)]
*  cannot enforce anything. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=461.6s)]
*  And that's expected to begin in the next couple of hours. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the U.S. once again expected to veto. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=467.92s)]
*  But as our reporting suggests, the U.S. has behind closed doors told to the Israelis [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=470.52000000000004s)]
*  that they have weeks left to continue the operation at the pace and magnitude at which [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=475.48s)]
*  it's being conducted now in Gaza. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=481.16s)]
*  Nick Robertson, thank you as always. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLs3miDGwKE&t=483.44s)]
