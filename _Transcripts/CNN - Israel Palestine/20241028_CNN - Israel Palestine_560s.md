# 'It is open season between Israel and Iran' after retaliation attack
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY)
*  Iran's leaders are vowing they will make an appropriate response to strikes by Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=0.0s)]
*  on Friday, but say they do not seek a war with Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=4.24s)]
*  The latest Israeli airstrikes over the weekend that killed at least five people. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=7.84s)]
*  Israel has said its forces hit military targets in response to Iranian attacks on Israel, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=11.94s)]
*  of course, earlier in the month. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=17.36s)]
*  Sinan's Jim Schuto joining me now from Jerusalem. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=18.8s)]
*  Jim, good to see you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=20.8s)]
*  So when we look at this, right, there is some question about what happens now in this period [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=21.8s)]
*  of escalation. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=26.44s)]
*  Is this in fact putting a pin in this chapter? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=27.6s)]
*  The short answer is we don't know, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=32.24s)]
*  Israel strikes overnight on Friday did not go to the extreme end, right, in terms of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  attacking oil facilities or nuclear facilities, which the U.S. had been pressuring Israel [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=41.24s)]
*  not to do because the U.S., as are others, was concerned about expanding the war. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=46.56s)]
*  So Israel stuck to military targets, though still quite a significant strike. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=51.64s)]
*  And while Iran is vowing retaliation, they've also publicly downplayed the effectiveness [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=57.44s)]
*  of these strikes to their own public, right, in terms of state media coverage, et cetera. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=63.12s)]
*  So it may be that in the near term, we've gotten through the worst period. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=68.72s)]
*  But big picture we should keep in mind that now it is open season, in effect, between [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=74.72000000000001s)]
*  Israel and Iran, that these two countries that had been attacking each other via proxies [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=81.0s)]
*  or for instance, when Israel carried out strikes in Iran, certainly didn't publicly advertise [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=85.92s)]
*  them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=90.64000000000001s)]
*  Now they are taking shots at each other with some regularity, right, two major Iranian [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=91.64000000000001s)]
*  missile strikes on Israel in the last year. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=97.16000000000001s)]
*  Now this strike, as well as the killing of the Hamas leader, Haniya, inside Tehran, by [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=100.12s)]
*  Israeli intelligence, it is presumed. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  So it certainly allows for the possibility of further strikes down the line. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=109.36s)]
*  And there are some here in Israel who talk about this strike on Friday as being one wave [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=113.36s)]
*  that might precede other waves of attacks. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  Really, it just remains to be seen. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  So short term, probably the answer is yes, the worst has passed. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=124.4s)]
*  But medium to longer term, we're in a new period in this region. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=128.6s)]
*  Yeah, we certainly are. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=132.32s)]
*  Jim, good to see you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=133.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=134.56s)]
*  Joining me now for more on the situation in the Middle East is Shita Parsi, who's the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=135.56s)]
*  executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  Just picking up on where Jim left off, that in the short term, this may in many ways be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  closing this particular chapter, but that longer term, it's now, to use Jim's words, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  sort of open season here between Israel and Iran. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=154.16s)]
*  Would you agree with that assessment? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  I think Jim is absolutely right about this. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=157.36s)]
*  This is just a chapter. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=162.36s)]
*  I think that the trajectory of this is still very negative in the sense that it is escalatory. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  The fact that it's open season also means now that former red lines have completely [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  been washed away and there is a struggle now to establish new ones. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=175.0s)]
*  From the Iranian perspective, part of the reason why you're seeing a bit of a shift [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  the public discourse there, which early on, as Jim correctly pointed out, tried to downplay [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=183.96s)]
*  this, you're seeing some indications that they're now shifting away from that. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=189.36s)]
*  Part of the reason for that is because if in this new open season, so to say, it is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  becoming normalized for Israel to strike Tehran without any significant consequences, then [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  that's a very negative development for the Iranians. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  That would put Iran in the same situation as Beirut and Damascus, which the Israelis [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=209.64s)]
*  regularly strike without causing any headlines anywhere, at least not in the West. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=214.32s)]
*  That's not something I think the Iranians will accept. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  And as a result, you're starting to see an impetus for some form of a response. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=221.0s)]
*  The challenge they have, of course, is how can we respond without risking a war that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=224.88s)]
*  they don't want, but that they think the Israelis want? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=229.48s)]
*  So to that point, what would you envision as a potential response? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=232.94s)]
*  I think, first of all, they are likely going to wait till after the U.S. election. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=238.64s)]
*  That's going to be a critical factor for their calculations as well as Israel's calculation. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=243.0s)]
*  The Pesachkiyan government that came into power just months ago really came in and hoped [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=248.4s)]
*  that they would be able to reopen negotiations with the United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=253.4s)]
*  And they had some hopes of potentially making a deal with Biden in the interim period between [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=257.44s)]
*  November and January, particularly if Kamala Harris wins the elections. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  So it's a calculation that will also come into play there is if they respond, what will [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=266.48s)]
*  that do to the prospect of potentially managing to restore some level of diplomacy between [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=271.16s)]
*  the United States and Iran, which is a Pesachkiyan priority? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=277.68s)]
*  When we look at how all of this is playing out as well, Israel, of course, still fighting [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=282.2s)]
*  in Gaza and in Lebanon. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=285.96s)]
*  We heard from Israeli officials today that they actually expect those efforts in and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=288.24s)]
*  around the Jabalya refugee camp to continue for perhaps a number of weeks to come. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=291.84s)]
*  All of that impacting ceasefire talks, which were restarted over the weekend. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=296.88s)]
*  And you have the looming election, as you point out. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=300.76s)]
*  Where and what are you watching in this moment, especially in the next eight days ahead of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=304.0s)]
*  the election here in the U.S.? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  I suspect that there's not much that's going to happen in the next eight days in terms [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=312.96s)]
*  of a ceasefire talk, similar to what we've seen in the last year, until you actually [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=317.23999999999995s)]
*  have a shift in the U.S. position in which it is willing to put pressure on the Israelis, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=321.64s)]
*  not just on everyone else, to go along with a ceasefire and a hostage exchange and stop [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=326.64s)]
*  the escalation. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=331.84s)]
*  We're not likely going to see a change. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=333.02s)]
*  I don't expect that before the election. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=334.56s)]
*  The question is, will a Kamala Harris presidency, even though she's not president yet, do something [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=336.64s)]
*  to change Biden's position? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=342.8s)]
*  And what will Biden do if the next person coming into the White House will be Donald [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=344.56s)]
*  Trump? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=348.88s)]
*  Trita Parsi, really appreciate your insight, your expertise. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=350.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=353.12s)]
*  A shocking, sobering warning today from the UN. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=354.12s)]
*  The entire population of northern Gaza is at risk of dying. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=357.24s)]
*  That assessment coming from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=361.08s)]
*  Israel, meantime, says it's nearly a one-month-long assault in and around the Jabal-i refugee camp. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=364.6s)]
*  Aimed at, it says, rooting out Hamas. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=369.24s)]
*  Will continue for at least a few more weeks. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=371.12s)]
*  Meantime, there is growing concern that Palestinians could soon lose a main lifeline for food, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=373.6s)]
*  medicine and other aid. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=378.6s)]
*  The Israeli Knesset this hour taking up legislation that would severely limit operations by the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  UN agency known as UNRWA in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=384.48s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond joining us now from Jerusalem with more. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=387.92s)]
*  Jeremy, first on that ominous warning from this UN agency about northern Gaza. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  The fact that the entire population is at risk of dying is perhaps the most stark we've [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  heard yet. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=402.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is a very stark warning. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=403.0s)]
*  It comes after weeks of UN and other humanitarian officials warning that the situation in northern [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  Gaza is indeed growing untenable. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  It is all very much coming to a head between the combination of the intense bombardment [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=416.4s)]
*  by the Israeli military, the ground operations happening there, the fighting with Hamas forces. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=421.24s)]
*  But also, of course, the fact that very little aid is still making its way, has yet to make [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=426.4s)]
*  its way into northern Gaza, despite efforts by the United States and others to tell Israel [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=431.20000000000005s)]
*  to ramp up the flow of aid. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=436.24s)]
*  We know that over the weekend, late last week, I should say, we saw Israeli forces raid the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=438.72s)]
*  Kamala Duwan Hospital, one of the few remaining functioning hospitals in northern Gaza. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=444.36s)]
*  And that, of course, is having a direct impact on the patients who are being treated there, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=449.72s)]
*  but also on the thousands of people who are sheltering in and around that hospital. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=453.56s)]
*  Dozens of health care workers were arrested in that Israeli military raid. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=457.8s)]
*  The military itself claims that about 100 Hamas fighters were arrested there. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=462.2s)]
*  They said that these were confirmed terrorists, although it's not clear if that includes the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=467.24s)]
*  dozens of health care workers who were also arrested. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  One Israeli military official telling me that there were at least a few Hamas fighters who [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=475.12s)]
*  they said were disguised as medical workers, although we don't have any evidence to prove [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=480.24s)]
*  out that claim. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=486.12s)]
*  What is clear, though, is that the hospital was damaged in this military operation, not [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=487.68s)]
*  only the outer wall that was breached as Israeli forces came in with heavy military vehicles, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  but also the oxygen center at the hospital that was severely damaged intentionally, according [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=496.2s)]
*  to this Israeli military official, because there were concerns that those oxygen tanks [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=500.64s)]
*  could be dual use or perhaps even booby trapped. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=505.36s)]
*  We know, of course, that that hospital is now facing a severe shortage of basic medical [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oLtLyADEOY&t=508.8s)]
