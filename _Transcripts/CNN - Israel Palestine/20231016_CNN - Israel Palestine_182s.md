# Veteran reporter shows what it's like inside Hamas tunnels under Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM)
*  And the US says it still knows nothing about the condition of the Americans believed to be taken hostage by Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=0.0s)]
*  And while their whereabouts remain unknown, some do believe that they could be held in Gaza's tunnels. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=6.44s)]
*  My next guest has actually walked through those tunnels. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=12.08s)]
*  I want to bring in veteran foreign affairs correspondent, Rina Ninen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Rina, these tunnels are kind of a bit of a source of some mystery, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=18.56s)]
*  but they are believed to be just literally under the feet of the Palestinian people, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=22.8s)]
*  as you can kind of see here under buildings, under apartments. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=27.52s)]
*  We also have some somewhat rare video. This is from 2017. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=30.56s)]
*  Can you walk us through what we are looking at here, what you've been through to? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=34.56s)]
*  You know, we have to tell you, these tunnels are far more elaborate than the ones I went down. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=39.24s)]
*  The ones I went down were built by teenage boys that essentially were made of dirt and are probably one time usage. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=43.04s)]
*  But you could see the potential of hostages being in these tunnels, fortified here with concrete. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=49.04s)]
*  What's also so troubling is as incredible as Israeli anti-detection systems are for these tunnels, which they do have, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=55.28s)]
*  it's really hard. Hamas has gotten smarter over the years about their ability to get in and destroy these tunnels. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=62.040000000000006s)]
*  So you see how fortified it is, the concrete, the fact that they can go down into here and go undetected. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=67.72s)]
*  I'm going to show a few more pictures here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  And you see the dirt around here. The ones I went through were essentially M54. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=76.36s)]
*  I was able to go down the whole entire route of these tunnels and then it slowly started to cave down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=81.36s)]
*  These are far better engineered and constructed because the tunnels that likely these hostages are, I bet, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=86.6s)]
*  are potentially the ones that are not intended for one time use. They're intended for this type of warfare. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=92.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, the other story here is about the civilians. They are now being asked to evacuate. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=98.56s)]
*  We're looking here at this evacuation map. There's really only one place for them to get out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  And it would be right here. This is the Ra'afah crossing that leads straight to Egypt. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=109.04s)]
*  I'm going to show another kind of image here. This is what it looks like up close. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=112.84s)]
*  What are the challenges here for civilians trying to get out? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=116.84s)]
*  Well, one, it's incredibly unpredictable and incredibly dangerous. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=119.32s)]
*  We know that there have been Israeli airstrikes and so you constantly don't know what could happen in this area. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=122.52s)]
*  The State Department has also said that if and when Ra'afah crossing eventually opens, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=127.68s)]
*  what could happen is it won't be open for a long extended period of time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=131.64s)]
*  It'll open quickly and could potentially close. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=135.88000000000002s)]
*  You've got all these people here in the Gaza Strip looking to get out. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  That's the one exit point right now is this Ra'afah, which enters into Egypt's Sinai Peninsula there. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=140.88000000000002s)]
*  So you've got the unpredictability. It's dangerous. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  And also, Abby, the fact that we've heard that we don't know how long it could be open. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  And of course, this is a very significant distance here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a small it's a small space, but it's a significant distance if you don't have a lot of means. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  If you don't have a lot of means and also you don't know how long you're camping out there for. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=160.12s)]
*  So the fact that these people could be down there trying to get humanitarian aid, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=163.76s)]
*  the Egyptians also don't want over a million people absorbed into Egypt. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=167.16s)]
*  So that's a big concern while they said they'll allow multinational people come into Egypt, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=171.52s)]
*  leave via Cairo. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=175.8s)]
*  These Palestinians coming through don't have that option. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=177.32s)]
*  All right, Reena Nainan, thank you so much. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LVVrfvv9BM&t=179.44s)]
