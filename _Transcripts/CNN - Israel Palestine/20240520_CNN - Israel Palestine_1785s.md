# EXCLUSIVE: ICC prosecutor seeks arrest warrants against Sinwar and Netanyahu for war crimes
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE)
*  Prosecutor Karim Khan, welcome to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=3.04s)]
*  And of course, we're here at the ICC. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=4.2s)]
*  You are today announcing that you are applying [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=7.28s)]
*  for arrest warrants for top military and political leadership [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=11.4s)]
*  in the Israel-Gaza war since the October 7th events. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=16.84s)]
*  First and foremost, explain to me exactly what you're asking for [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=22.52s)]
*  and who you are charging. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=26.36s)]
*  Today, Christiane, we've applied for warrants [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=28.84s)]
*  to the pretrial chamber of the International Criminal Court [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=30.96s)]
*  in relation to three individuals that are Hamas members. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=35.2s)]
*  Sinwa, who's in charge on the ground. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=40.68s)]
*  That's Yahya Sinwa. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=43.52s)]
*  Dave, who's in charge of the Al-Qasim Brigade. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  And Hanir, who's one of their political bureau based in Doha. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=48.84s)]
*  Let me just, for everybody to understand, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=53.36s)]
*  Yahya Sinwa is the head of what they call [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=55.2s)]
*  the Islamic resistance movement, Hamas, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=57.48s)]
*  the military operation or even wider. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=59.8s)]
*  Mohammad Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri, otherwise known as Dave, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  commander in chief of the military wings Al-Qasim Brigade. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  And Ismail Hanir, head of the Hamas political bureau. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=69.6s)]
*  What are the charges? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  The charges are extermination, murder, taking of hostages, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=76.96s)]
*  rape and sexual assault in detention. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=81.36s)]
*  So these are the key crimes that are alleged [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=85.0s)]
*  to have been committed by these three individuals. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  The world was shocked on the 7th of October [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=91.88s)]
*  when people were ripped from their bedrooms, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=94.24s)]
*  from their homes, from the different kibbutzim in Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  And people have suffered enormously. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  And we have a variety of evidence [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=103.24s)]
*  to support the applications [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  that we've submitted to the judges. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  And just tell us what the evidence is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=108.0s)]
*  Obviously the world has seen the real time images. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=110.36s)]
*  The Israeli government has put out videos [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=115.08s)]
*  which is shared to the UN and others, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=117.55999999999999s)]
*  journalists about what happened. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=120.16s)]
*  There are body cams on many of the Hamas fighters, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  whoever was there at the time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  Is that the evidence or do you have more? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  We have more. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=130.12s)]
*  We have authenticated videos and photographs. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=132.16s)]
*  We have CCTV, camera pictures. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=135.04s)]
*  We have eyewitness evidence. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=139.6s)]
*  We have evidence of survivors. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=141.96s)]
*  I mean, it's remarkable. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=143.72s)]
*  The victims and survivors from Israel [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=145.24s)]
*  that have engaged with my office [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=149.12s)]
*  have this righteous demand for justice and accountability. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=150.88s)]
*  They've come here. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=154.76s)]
*  I've also met them in the different kibbutzim [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=156.24s)]
*  and they want justice and accountability. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=158.6s)]
*  So we have also expert evidence. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=162.96s)]
*  So there's a whole variety of information [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=165.0s)]
*  that we have authenticated [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=168.0s)]
*  that we think is relevant and probative [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=169.28s)]
*  and that is sufficient, we say, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=171.4s)]
*  to sustain the crimes that we put forward to the judges. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  You have also issued warrants against the top political [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=176.12s)]
*  and military leadership of the government [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=180.0s)]
*  of the state of Israel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  We've applied for warrants. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=184.08s)]
*  Of course, the judges must determine [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  whether or not to issue them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=187.4s)]
*  But we've applied today, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  we'll apply for warrants for Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=190.56s)]
*  and also Minister of Defense Galant [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=194.60000000000002s)]
*  for the crimes of causing extermination, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=198.16s)]
*  causing starvation as a method of war, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=205.04s)]
*  including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=207.44s)]
*  deliberately targeting civilians in conflict. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=211.4s)]
*  And the sad thing really is in relation to both categories. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=214.48000000000002s)]
*  I have been saying repeatedly in Cairo in October last year [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  at the Rafa crossing on Israeli television in Ramallah, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=225.64s)]
*  everywhere I can to the parties to the conflict, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=230.88s)]
*  comply now, don't complain later. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  And of course, hostages have not been released. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=238.04s)]
*  That insidious crime continues [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=241.16s)]
*  for so many innocent Israelis that are in custody. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  I held hostage by Hamas and families [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=249.88s)]
*  that are waiting for their return. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=252.27999999999997s)]
*  And of course, we see pictures of starving children, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  of emaciated children. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=257.64s)]
*  We have a variety of evidence to support, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=259.44s)]
*  not polemics, but evidence that's been forensically analyzed [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=263.4s)]
*  to sustain the charge also of starvation [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  being used by Netanyahu and Galant as a method of war. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=268.64s)]
*  And it's awful that in 2024, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=272.88s)]
*  we have had to submit these applications [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=274.64s)]
*  to the judges of the ICC for warrants. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=277.52s)]
*  I'm going to get into starvation [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=279.68s)]
*  as a weapon of war in a moment. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=281.2s)]
*  But first I want to ask you, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  the word genocide has been used by both sides [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=284.84s)]
*  and many believe that genocide is being committed, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=288.6s)]
*  but you do not, you're not using that word. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=292.76s)]
*  Well, this is an active investigation [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  and we have criminal charges that we can use, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=297.44s)]
*  genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=301.48s)]
*  In relation to this current stage of investigations, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=304.8s)]
*  the charges that we've put forward to the judges [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  do not include genocide, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=310.16s)]
*  but we are continuing to investigate. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=312.48s)]
*  It's a very complex situation. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=314.32s)]
*  We've not been allowed access into Gaza [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=316.28s)]
*  by the Israeli authorities. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=318.56s)]
*  We're also continuing our investigations [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=320.0s)]
*  in relation to the Hamas attacks. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=322.96s)]
*  And if and when the evidence points us [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=324.8s)]
*  in a particular direction, we will not hesitate to act. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=327.04s)]
*  So it's still an active investigation, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=330.12s)]
*  but yes, today we haven't. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=332.0s)]
*  What is extermination? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=333.92s)]
*  It's mass killing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=335.76s)]
*  Different than genocide? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=337.48s)]
*  Yes, genocide is defined by specific intent, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=338.56s)]
*  not only killing, but an intention [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=341.84s)]
*  to destroy the group in whole or in part. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  It's a specific intent to destroy the group [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=347.67999999999995s)]
*  in whole or in part. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=350.44s)]
*  So we have not included in our application today [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=351.32s)]
*  a request for warrants for the crime of genocide. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=356.56s)]
*  So extermination, war crimes, crimes against humanity. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=359.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to ask you about starvation [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  because although it was accepted by the ICC [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=364.52s)]
*  as a war crime when you were created in 1998, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=368.44s)]
*  I don't believe it's ever been prosecuted before [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  as a weapon of war. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=375.76s)]
*  No, it's not that I'm aware of. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=377.4s)]
*  I think, unfortunately, this situation will be a first [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=379.08s)]
*  and it's very unusual. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=383.44s)]
*  We see a population, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=384.52s)]
*  large numbers of children and women [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  that have already endured more than 17 years [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  of a very rigid regime of allowing goods into Gaza. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=395.0s)]
*  I think even in 2022, the United Nations and others said [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=401.16s)]
*  that 80% of the population lived on humanitarian supplies [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=404.64s)]
*  and that's just become even more pernicious [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=412.32s)]
*  since the 8th of October with all the other restrictions. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=415.2s)]
*  And the words of the Secretary General [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=419.36s)]
*  of the United Nations, of the head of the Office [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=421.52s)]
*  of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  Martin Griffiths, WHO, UNICEF. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it seems everybody in the international firmament [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=429.68s)]
*  has spoken with grave concern, extreme concern, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=432.56s)]
*  but we haven't seen food, water, medicines [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=437.48s)]
*  go to the most vulnerable and they have those rights, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=441.88s)]
*  not because of something that I'm saying, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=444.28000000000003s)]
*  it's because it's required in the Geneva Conventions [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=446.72s)]
*  and it's required in the Rome Statute. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=449.44s)]
*  So as of April 17th, according to humanitarian organizations [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=451.36s)]
*  and the authorities, whatever exists on the ground in Gaza, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=455.92s)]
*  28 children under 12 have died, including 12 babies [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=459.32s)]
*  about a month old because of malnutrition related conditions. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=463.6s)]
*  The Defense Minister, Youav Galland, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=469.08000000000004s)]
*  who today you are issuing an arrest warrant [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=470.8s)]
*  or the request for an arrest warrant for, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=473.28000000000003s)]
*  said on October 9th, two days after October 7th, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=475.36s)]
*  we are imposing a complete siege. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=478.92s)]
*  There will be no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=481.16s)]
*  Everything is closed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=485.0s)]
*  We are fighting human animals and we will act accordingly. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=486.4s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu on October 13th said, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=490.92s)]
*  we will exact a price that will be remembered by them [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=493.4s)]
*  and Israel's other enemies for decades to come. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=496.12s)]
*  Are those, is that the basis on which you establish intent [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=501.36s)]
*  or is that part of your evidence? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=507.32s)]
*  Much more than that, but yes, some of the words uttered [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=511.2s)]
*  by the two individuals, Minister of Defense Galland [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=514.96s)]
*  and Prime Minister Netanyahu, are of course [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=519.28s)]
*  probative and relevant. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=521.84s)]
*  The fact that so many other individuals have said, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=523.72s)]
*  words like there's no such thing as an innocent civilian [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=529.2s)]
*  in Gaza, they're all responsible. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=532.2s)]
*  The words by members of the security committee, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=535.16s)]
*  I mean, there's a whole variety of words that are said [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=538.0s)]
*  and done by the government that have not been disowned, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=540.96s)]
*  that have not been denied, that have not, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=544.24s)]
*  that the two individuals have not disassociated [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=547.4s)]
*  themselves from and I think that's relevant. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=549.88s)]
*  But it's again, it's a very complex operation. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=552.0s)]
*  It's not just the denial of aid. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=555.44s)]
*  It's not only the fact that as an occupying power, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=559.0s)]
*  Israel has an affirmative obligation [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=561.92s)]
*  to make sure food and the objects indispensable [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=564.64s)]
*  to survival get to the civilians. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=568.88s)]
*  They have an affirmative obligation. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=570.84s)]
*  They're in control of the north of Gaza, for example. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=572.4s)]
*  I'd have tanks are in situ, they could guard aid convoys [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=575.2s)]
*  going in and making sure it goes to the camps. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=579.6s)]
*  They're not doing that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=581.44s)]
*  But in addition, one has to look at a wider aspect. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  Water has been cut off. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  Electricity has been, plants have been either destroyed [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=588.28s)]
*  or targeted, fuel can't go in. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=592.56s)]
*  Desalination plants are completely dysfunctional. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=594.76s)]
*  There's no desalination plant in the north of Gaza at all. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  Water purification tablets, filtration systems [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=605.5999999999999s)]
*  have been classified as dual use objects, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=609.76s)]
*  as have incubators, as has oxygen for hospital, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=614.5999999999999s)]
*  as have anesthetics. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=617.0s)]
*  One sees 90% of all the greenhouses [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=619.04s)]
*  in the north of Gaza destroyed. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=623.16s)]
*  40% of the land that was used for agriculture [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=624.52s)]
*  has been destroyed since the conflict started. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=628.92s)]
*  70% of the fishing vessels. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=633.52s)]
*  I mean, every avenue that is so important to human survival [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=636.56s)]
*  has been constrained or suffocated because of a policy. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=643.28s)]
*  And the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=646.36s)]
*  which said we're at breaking point, the words of UNICEF, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=649.2s)]
*  the words of UNRWA saying that we've got a trickle of aid [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=652.44s)]
*  in a sea of need, all of these giants [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=655.1600000000001s)]
*  of the international system, their words, their concerns [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=658.72s)]
*  have been put to one side, unfortunately, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=661.8000000000001s)]
*  in the face of other imperatives and what seems to be a bid [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=663.88s)]
*  also for the collective punishment of the people of Gaza. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=669.0s)]
*  What is the international law on the restrictions [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=672.8800000000001s)]
*  that you're talking about? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  And for instance, the checking of aid convoys. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=677.12s)]
*  The Israeli government says it is at war [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=679.48s)]
*  with a terror organization and has worked in coordination [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=681.64s)]
*  with the US, Egypt, and international aid agencies [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=685.0s)]
*  to get aid in. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=687.76s)]
*  Netanyahu himself on October 29th, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=689.5999999999999s)]
*  after two weeks of nothing getting in, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=691.92s)]
*  another week later said, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=694.76s)]
*  we must prevent a humanitarian disaster. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=696.0s)]
*  What do you make of those words? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=700.12s)]
*  And what is the law on stopping and checking aid convoys? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=701.4s)]
*  See, we have to look at words and analyze them [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=705.96s)]
*  against what is taking place. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=709.44s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has been on the record to say [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=711.64s)]
*  that the access of humanitarian aid [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  gives Israel important leeway that is being used. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=717.5600000000001s)]
*  They've talked about a diplomatic eye in dome [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=720.6s)]
*  as part of allowing aid in and not allowing aid in [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=722.32s)]
*  and all the rest of it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=725.2s)]
*  Israel has every right not to give succor to Hamas. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=726.44s)]
*  That is not contested. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=732.2800000000001s)]
*  Israel has every right and it is an obligation [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=733.84s)]
*  to get hostages back. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=736.1600000000001s)]
*  But you must do so by complying with the law. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=738.24s)]
*  The fact that Hamas fighters need water [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=741.12s)]
*  doesn't justify denying water [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=744.96s)]
*  from all the civilian population of Gaza. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=747.2s)]
*  There's an obligation. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=750.08s)]
*  As I said, it's an affirmative, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=751.12s)]
*  in addition to everything else, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=752.1600000000001s)]
*  there's an affirmative obligation as an occupying power [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=753.2800000000001s)]
*  that Israel is to make sure water, medicines, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=756.2s)]
*  anesthetics, insulin goes to the people that need it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=759.96s)]
*  If tanks can go in, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=763.56s)]
*  why can't those tanks and those soldiers guard aid convoys? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=764.52s)]
*  So there's a lot of deficiencies that give rise [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=769.3199999999999s)]
*  not just to recklessness or negligence or indifference, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  but seems to be part of a criminal common plan [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=777.9599999999999s)]
*  to deny these objects indispensable to the survival [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=780.68s)]
*  of the civilian population. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=786.68s)]
*  And how many doctors have to talk about amputating [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=788.4s)]
*  the limbs of little babies or children [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=791.52s)]
*  without anesthetic or how many people need to die [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=793.24s)]
*  without insulin or how many people with 50% burns [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=796.24s)]
*  can be left by the doctors in the different hospitals [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=800.52s)]
*  because they don't have antibiotic creams for burns [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=803.16s)]
*  and they can't save them without that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=805.32s)]
*  for us to realize that the law is being breached. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=807.12s)]
*  Now this is what we have analyzed [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=809.4s)]
*  and we've presented it for judges [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=811.28s)]
*  who make the final decision [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=813.12s)]
*  if warrants should be issued or not. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=814.16s)]
*  And again, you say that you have requested these warrants [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=815.52s)]
*  based on a higher level of evidence [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=820.28s)]
*  than is normally required, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=823.0799999999999s)]
*  not just that it is a reasonable belief [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=825.0799999999999s)]
*  that it could lead to actual warrants and a charge, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=828.4s)]
*  but you believe your evidence has what? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=831.16s)]
*  Well, when I came in as prosecutor, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=833.76s)]
*  the standard for a warrant are reasonable grounds to believe. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=836.16s)]
*  That's what the judges have to determine. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=838.6s)]
*  I, across all our situations, when I became prosecutor, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=840.76s)]
*  I required the leaders in the office, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=844.72s)]
*  the heads of the teams, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=846.88s)]
*  to certify that there's a realistic prospect of conviction. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=848.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not enough in these kinds of cases [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=851.76s)]
*  to have enough to issue a warrant. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=854.5999999999999s)]
*  We must be able to bring it home. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=855.88s)]
*  On both sides? On both sides. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=857.28s)]
*  And in relation to both, I've determined, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=858.64s)]
*  and the team are unanimous, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=860.3599999999999s)]
*  that we have a realistic prospect of conviction [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=861.8399999999999s)]
*  in relation to the three warrants being sought [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=864.8399999999999s)]
*  regarding the Hamas leaders [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=867.9599999999999s)]
*  and the two that are being sought [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=870.1199999999999s)]
*  in relation to Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=871.76s)]
*  and Foreign Minister Galant. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=874.76s)]
*  And of course, the judges will decide if you've got it right [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=876.0799999999999s)]
*  and our analysis is spot on or not. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=878.08s)]
*  I'm going to get to the actual how you affect these warrants, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=880.5200000000001s)]
*  given the practicalities of the situation in a moment. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=883.48s)]
*  But first, I want to ask you about [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=886.12s)]
*  the so-called political nature that many people will claim. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has already said [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  ICC charges would be a scandal on a historic scale, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=895.0400000000001s)]
*  an indelible stain on the idea of justice. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=898.72s)]
*  Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=901.76s)]
*  And Netanyahu has also said [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=905.44s)]
*  it would be an anti-Semitic hate crime. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=906.76s)]
*  Now, we haven't heard anything from Hamas [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  about how they would react. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=911.28s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=914.24s)]
*  There must have been a huge amount of pressure on you [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=917.3199999999999s)]
*  from all sides to do and not to do. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=920.04s)]
*  Well, this court, Christiane, is a child of Nuremberg. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=924.28s)]
*  It was built because of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=927.76s)]
*  the awful pictures that haunt us today of the Shoah [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=931.84s)]
*  and the gas chambers and then the Balkans [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=934.96s)]
*  and the list goes on. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=936.76s)]
*  And we have to look at the evidence. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=938.24s)]
*  And the way I very simply try to do things [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=943.2800000000001s)]
*  is look at the evidence, look at the conduct, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=945.64s)]
*  look at the victims, and airbrush out the nationality. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=949.6800000000001s)]
*  And if a crime's been committed, we should move forward. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=956.08s)]
*  Nobody is above the law. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=958.6800000000001s)]
*  No people by dint of birth or passport, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=959.96s)]
*  religion, nationality, or the color of their skin [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=963.16s)]
*  have a get out of jail free card, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=966.16s)]
*  have a free pass to say, well, the law doesn't apply to us. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=968.3199999999999s)]
*  This is a moment when we see in the shadow of Ukraine [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=971.28s)]
*  a increasing cacophony of noise [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=975.0s)]
*  of double standards and selectivity. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=977.76s)]
*  And what we're trying to do is not go with a tide of emotion, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  but take our time, move as effectively as we can, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=984.28s)]
*  but be guided by evidence. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=987.6s)]
*  And every human life, every baby that is killed, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=988.8399999999999s)]
*  whether it's a baby that's cruelly abducted by Hamas [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=992.56s)]
*  and killed, or a baby that's been bombed or killed [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=995.9599999999999s)]
*  or has died in incubators because of no electricity [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=999.9599999999999s)]
*  or water or food in Gaza, for them, for their families, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1003.56s)]
*  and humanity, it's a tragedy. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1007.52s)]
*  And this is why we have a court. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1010.0s)]
*  It's about the equal application of the law. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1011.64s)]
*  No people are better than another. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1014.5999999999999s)]
*  No people anywhere are saints. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1016.04s)]
*  And so we have to apply a yardstick of legality to conduct. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1019.64s)]
*  We've done that. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1023.0400000000001s)]
*  And this is why we've made the applications [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1023.88s)]
*  that the judges must determine. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1026.4s)]
*  I'm going to read you some heavy criticism that you've [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1028.04s)]
*  received from the United States. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1031.0s)]
*  As we know, the United States is not a party to the ICC, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1032.48s)]
*  nor is Israel. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1036.0s)]
*  Recently, when word came out that this may be happening [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1037.6s)]
*  at some point, US senators and US Congress people, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1040.92s)]
*  mostly Republicans, wrote you a letter signed [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1045.8s)]
*  by Senator Tom Cotton, Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1048.28s)]
*  Marco Rubio, and others. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1050.76s)]
*  This is the quote. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1052.64s)]
*  Target Israel and we will target you. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1053.8s)]
*  If you move forward with the measures indicated [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1056.76s)]
*  in the report, we will move to end all American support [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1059.1200000000001s)]
*  for the ICC, sanction your employees and associates, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1062.64s)]
*  and bar you and your families from the United States. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1066.6s)]
*  You have been warned. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1069.44s)]
*  Is that a threat? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1071.44s)]
*  I think that's the plain meaning of it in English. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1073.6s)]
*  But, you know, there's hotheads everywhere. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1077.6s)]
*  And there's people that are mature statesmen [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1081.1599999999999s)]
*  and stateswomen and leaders. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1083.2s)]
*  There are those that have fidelity to something greater [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1085.76s)]
*  than themselves, whether it's their constitutions, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1087.6799999999998s)]
*  but ultimately it's the rule of law. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1090.04s)]
*  The good news is I think for the last two and a half years, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1092.24s)]
*  we've had very positive engagement with the Biden [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1094.84s)]
*  administration in the United States. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1097.28s)]
*  We're working across a range of situations, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1099.0s)]
*  whether it's in Ukraine or Darfur. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1101.6s)]
*  And I've said to distinguished members on the Hill [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1103.84s)]
*  and to the administration that Rome statute values [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1108.28s)]
*  are quintessential American values. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1111.48s)]
*  It's against bullying. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1113.6399999999999s)]
*  It's against the untrammeled power [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1114.48s)]
*  against the most vulnerable. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1117.12s)]
*  It's the rights and the dignity of the individual. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1118.32s)]
*  It's the protection of babies. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1123.28s)]
*  I mean, these are fundamental American values [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1125.1999999999998s)]
*  that should engender bipartisan support. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1127.36s)]
*  Now, of course, this situation, unfortunately, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1130.04s)]
*  lies on the San Andreas fault of international politics [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1134.3999999999999s)]
*  and strategic interests. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1137.72s)]
*  And of course, I've had some elected leaders speak to me [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1141.1599999999999s)]
*  and be very blunt. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1144.0s)]
*  This court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1146.8s)]
*  was what one senior leader told me. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1151.0s)]
*  We don't view it like that. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1155.8799999999999s)]
*  This court is the legacy of Nuremberg. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1157.52s)]
*  This court is a sad indictment of humanity. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1159.84s)]
*  This court should be the triumph of law over power [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1162.68s)]
*  and brute force. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1167.56s)]
*  Grab what you can, take what you want, do what you will. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1168.52s)]
*  And we're going to simply be, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1172.08s)]
*  we're not going to be dissuaded by threats [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1173.9199999999998s)]
*  or any other activities because in the end, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1177.52s)]
*  we have to fulfill our responsibilities as prosecutors, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1180.24s)]
*  as the men and women of the office, as judges, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1185.3999999999999s)]
*  as the registry to something bigger than ourselves, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1187.8799999999999s)]
*  which is the fidelity to justice. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1190.28s)]
*  And we're not going to be swayed [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1192.56s)]
*  by the different types of threats, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1195.24s)]
*  some of which are public and some maybe are not. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1196.4399999999998s)]
*  You mentioned without names that there are many [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1198.28s)]
*  who have been indicted who are not in democratic states, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1202.3999999999999s)]
*  who are essentially despots. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1205.6799999999998s)]
*  Israel is a democracy. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1209.9599999999998s)]
*  They have a judiciary, they have law enforcement, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1211.84s)]
*  they have elected leaders. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1214.6399999999999s)]
*  Why do you need to do this when they have a system [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1216.52s)]
*  that could do this? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1220.28s)]
*  I'd much rather Israel does it. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1221.88s)]
*  I mean, Israel, you're right, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1224.56s)]
*  it has a very good Supreme Court, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1225.44s)]
*  it has very qualified, brilliant lawyers. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1229.6s)]
*  But even if you read recently public information, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1234.56s)]
*  for example, in the New York Times, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1238.72s)]
*  I think the Bergman and Mazzelli report, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1240.4s)]
*  if one goes back to the 80s and look at the Karp report, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1243.3999999999999s)]
*  a deputy attorney general of Israel [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1248.0s)]
*  who said that Israel was unwilling and unable [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1249.9599999999998s)]
*  to investigate crimes in the occupied territories. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1251.8s)]
*  If one looks at the Sassoon report, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1254.36s)]
*  if one looks at general, US three-star general [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1257.08s)]
*  that was in Washington, DC between 2019 and 2021, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1261.7199999999998s)]
*  who said there's no accountability, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1266.52s)]
*  the simple truth is that for all the application of the law [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1268.3999999999999s)]
*  in the territory of Israel, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1272.08s)]
*  unfortunately, it doesn't appear to be applied [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1273.84s)]
*  with vigor or sincerity in the occupied territories [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1276.52s)]
*  or in Gaza, and this is why we have to move forward. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1279.12s)]
*  Of course, if Israel disagrees, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1281.96s)]
*  if they think they are investigating the same individuals [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1284.68s)]
*  and the same conduct and the policies that underpin them, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1289.12s)]
*  they are free, notwithstanding their objections [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1293.28s)]
*  to jurisdiction, to raise a challenge [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1295.6s)]
*  before the judges of the court, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1297.68s)]
*  and that's what I would advise them to do. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1299.32s)]
*  But the simple truth of the matter is the disregard [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1300.72s)]
*  of the law in this situation and the policies [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1305.3600000000001s)]
*  and the utterances that are coming from the prime minister, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1308.88s)]
*  the minister of defense, support and corroborate [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  the other evidence we have from a variety of sources. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1317.3200000000002s)]
*  I just wanted to fill in for our viewers. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1320.1200000000001s)]
*  You mentioned the big New York Times magazine report [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1321.3600000000001s)]
*  this weekend by Ronan Bergman and Mark Mazzetti, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1323.88s)]
*  an eight-year effort. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1325.92s)]
*  It was titled Unpunished, and as you say, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1327.52s)]
*  it is about the failure of the Israeli system, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1330.96s)]
*  police, legal and military, to punish settlers [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1333.2s)]
*  on the occupied West Bank as they punish Arab Palestinians [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1338.0s)]
*  on the West Bank. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1342.0s)]
*  Now, you talk about the state of Palestine [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1344.12s)]
*  and therefore you have jurisdiction over things [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1349.3999999999999s)]
*  that happen in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1352.08s)]
*  There are those who disagree with you. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1354.32s)]
*  Clearly Israel disagrees, the United States disagrees. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1355.76s)]
*  They point out that as yet there is no official state [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1359.04s)]
*  of Palestine recognized by the Security Council. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1362.0s)]
*  What is your jurisdiction there? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1364.8s)]
*  Well, it's a jurisdiction that's detailed in the statute [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1367.32s)]
*  and that has been decided by majority [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1371.12s)]
*  by the pre-trial chamber, leaving aside for the moment [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1373.36s)]
*  the fact that 141 countries have recognized Palestine [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1377.4s)]
*  as a state. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1381.24s)]
*  In the General Assembly. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1382.08s)]
*  In the General Assembly, 124 states that make up [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1382.92s)]
*  the assembly of state parties agreed for Palestine [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1386.28s)]
*  to be accepted as a state party to the Rome statute. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1389.84s)]
*  And so by the end of that, clearly we have jurisdiction. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1395.92s)]
*  The Geneva Conventions also make it clear [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1399.88s)]
*  that it applies to high contracting parties. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1402.04s)]
*  Israel is a high contracting party as is Palestine. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1404.6s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1407.4s)]
*  It means that they have both committed to comply [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1408.32s)]
*  with the provisions of the Geneva Conventions [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1411.64s)]
*  that includes the prohibition on starvation [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1413.76s)]
*  as a method of war, that includes the prohibition [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1416.3600000000001s)]
*  on taking hostages or willfully killing or extermination. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1420.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, these come from the Rome statute, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1423.6000000000001s)]
*  but originally they found form in the Geneva Conventions. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1425.96s)]
*  So we apply the law. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1429.64s)]
*  There's been judicial pronouncements by the ICC [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1430.92s)]
*  and we have to be guarded by those. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1434.6000000000001s)]
*  The Hamas leaders who you have sought arrest warrants for, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1437.72s)]
*  do you have any hope that anybody will move against them? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1442.88s)]
*  Do you have any hope of ever getting to them again? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1446.16s)]
*  The ICC does not have a police force. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1448.88s)]
*  You cannot go and apprehend. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1451.1200000000001s)]
*  As far as we know, at least two of them are underground, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1452.6000000000001s)]
*  potentially in tunnels in Gaza. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1455.2s)]
*  Anis Malhania appears to be the leader involved [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1457.24s)]
*  in the political negotiations indirect between Israel [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1460.68s)]
*  and Hamas with the US, Qatar, other nations mediating. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1464.72s)]
*  How do you expect to go after them? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1469.3600000000001s)]
*  Who do you think is gonna hand them over? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1471.88s)]
*  Well, the first thing is for judges [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1474.16s)]
*  to rule on the applications. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1475.3200000000002s)]
*  Until the judges rule on the application, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1477.48s)]
*  all it is is an application that doesn't have legal effect. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1479.7600000000002s)]
*  But then states have certain responsibilities [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1482.96s)]
*  and individuals have choices. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1485.16s)]
*  If individuals say that what's alleged is not made out, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1487.0400000000002s)]
*  it's bunkum, it's nonsense, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1492.7600000000002s)]
*  put your case before the independent judges of the court. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1496.5200000000002s)]
*  This court has had acquittals, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1498.68s)]
*  this court has not confirmed cases. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1500.44s)]
*  The record shows that it's a forensic laboratory [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1502.76s)]
*  in which the evidence determines [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1505.96s)]
*  whether or not people are convicted, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1509.28s)]
*  cases are confirmed or cases are kicked out. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1511.48s)]
*  That applies to Hamas leaders if they want. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1514.6000000000001s)]
*  And if not, we have to see what are the other opportunities [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1516.76s)]
*  if they're either in Palestine, which is a state party, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1520.24s)]
*  or if they're in Qatar, which is a non-state party. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1523.04s)]
*  But in a way, that's getting ahead of ourselves. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1525.52s)]
*  Today, the announcement is the application [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1528.84s)]
*  and the judges have to be given the time [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1531.04s)]
*  to independently and dispassionately assess [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1532.9599999999998s)]
*  what we've given, nothing is a given. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1535.24s)]
*  They have to assess it and make a determination [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1538.04s)]
*  whether or not to issue warrants. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1540.6799999999998s)]
*  But I also wanted to underline the fact that [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1543.12s)]
*  you mentioned in an earlier question [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1547.76s)]
*  the allegations of antisemitism, the hate, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1549.52s)]
*  the idea that by applying the law blindly, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1553.04s)]
*  we are favoring one side or persecuting [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1557.6s)]
*  or being hostile to another side [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1560.3999999999999s)]
*  and nothing can be further from the truth. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1561.84s)]
*  We have so many people of distinction that are respected [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1564.6399999999999s)]
*  and they independently came in, I brought them in, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1570.48s)]
*  they sat in the evidence review. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1573.9199999999998s)]
*  This is not a witch hunt. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1575.84s)]
*  This is not some kind of emotional reaction to noise. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1577.3999999999999s)]
*  We've been criticized for going too slowly, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1580.84s)]
*  criticized for going too fast. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1582.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a forensic process that is expected [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1584.56s)]
*  of us as international prosecutors, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1588.52s)]
*  as an independent court to build evidence that is solid, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1590.44s)]
*  that will not dissolve in the courtroom. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1594.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's what we've done. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  Today is the fulfillment of that first stage, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1597.36s)]
*  this first round of applications in which we say [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1600.04s)]
*  we have done our job, we now give it to the judges [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1603.08s)]
*  to scrutinize, so it's not against any people [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1606.08s)]
*  and it's not against or for any interest. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1609.9199999999998s)]
*  It's simply because if we don't apply the law equally, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1614.24s)]
*  we're going to disintegrate as a species. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1618.72s)]
*  Of course, what's happening in the West Bank [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1621.08s)]
*  is extremely worrying. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1623.16s)]
*  It's an issue also that we are investigating, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1626.08s)]
*  but there's a certain, in democracies, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1628.6s)]
*  political choices tend to be determinative. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1634.72s)]
*  And all I can say is that Israel, the leaders, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1638.8s)]
*  the country has a choice that they can engage [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1643.44s)]
*  and do what is necessary to meet complementarity [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1648.88s)]
*  in the United Kingdom. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1652.48s)]
*  In the Iraq investigations [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1654.52s)]
*  before I was appointed prosecutor, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1656.1200000000001s)]
*  it was found that there were deficiencies [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1658.2800000000002s)]
*  in the legal system for military justice. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1661.16s)]
*  But we have really sincerely looked at things [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1665.24s)]
*  with a broad horizon, looking at incriminating [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1668.6000000000001s)]
*  and exonerating evidence equally, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1672.84s)]
*  looking at evidence, authenticating the evidence [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  and realizing that we're not worth the job, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1678.6s)]
*  the title as being a prosecutor or being lawyers [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  or having an international criminal court [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1686.84s)]
*  if we are dissuaded because of extraneous interests [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1689.52s)]
*  from moving forward. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1693.3999999999999s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1694.9199999999998s)]
*  I go back to this basic premise, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1695.9599999999998s)]
*  a child in Myanmar that's persecuted [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1697.6s)]
*  or a child in Israel that is an orphan [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1703.04s)]
*  or that has been taken and killed [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1706.6s)]
*  or one in Ukraine, for their family, there's no difference. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1710.6399999999999s)]
*  Their universe has been torn to shreds. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1714.4399999999998s)]
*  And this is the need for the court [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1716.6799999999998s)]
*  and independent judges to scrutinize, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1719.24s)]
*  not look at the politics, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1721.56s)]
*  not look at a dysfunctional security council, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1723.12s)]
*  not look at the difficulties it may cause, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1725.76s)]
*  regional organizations or different groupings, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1728.1999999999998s)]
*  but simply say, is the evidence reliable? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1732.16s)]
*  And if so, we go back to King John, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1735.44s)]
*  that the king is under no man but God on the law. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1739.6000000000001s)]
*  We all must be subject to that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1742.0s)]
*  Otherwise, what is this international rules-based system? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1743.72s)]
*  What is the principles of public international law [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1747.24s)]
*  that so many men and women have given their lives for [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1750.6000000000001s)]
*  since the Second World War, particularly? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1753.96s)]
*  And I think it's a dishonor for them. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1756.44s)]
*  It's a dishonor for the victims of the gas chambers [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1758.92s)]
*  if we airbrush out inconvenient truths. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1761.6399999999999s)]
*  And we have to try our best to achieve justice [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1764.12s)]
*  for the victims of the 7th of October. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1767.08s)]
*  We also must try our best to do justice [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1769.7199999999998s)]
*  for so many innocent people that are suffering as we speak [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1773.04s)]
*  in Israel and also in Gaza, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1776.32s)]
*  as well as in other parts of Palestine. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1778.76s)]
*  Prosecutor Karim Khan, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1781.3999999999999s)]
*  thank you very much indeed for joining us. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1782.3999999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BquEw4kNNE&t=1784.48s)]
