# Biden: Hostage release 'only a start'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44)
*  Yesterday, families all across America gathered together with their loved ones and to give [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=0.0s)]
*  thanks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=7.0s)]
*  We must be thankful for in America. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=8.24s)]
*  The food on our tables, the family and loved ones in our homes, and the many blessings [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=10.84s)]
*  that come from living in the greatest nation on earth. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=15.46s)]
*  Today we can also be thankful for families being recruited and reunited with loved ones [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=18.68s)]
*  who have been held hostage for nearly 50 days. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=24.48s)]
*  Many this morning, under a deal reached by extensive U.S. diplomacy, including numerous [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=29.04s)]
*  calls I've made from the Oval Office to leaders across the region, fighting in Gaza will halt [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=33.72s)]
*  for four days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=40.04s)]
*  This deal also is structured to allow a pause to continue for more than 50 hostages to be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=42.08s)]
*  released. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=48.68s)]
*  That's our goal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=49.68s)]
*  This morning, I've been engaged with my team as we began the first difficult days of implementing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=51.3s)]
*  this deal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=56.26s)]
*  It's only a start, but so far it's gone well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=57.9s)]
*  Early this morning, 13 Israeli hostages were released, including an elderly woman, a grandmother, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=61.739999999999995s)]
*  and mothers with their young children, some under the age of six years old. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=67.74s)]
*  Separately, several Thai nationals and Filipino nationals were also kidnapped by Hamas on [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=73.06s)]
*  the 7th. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=78.53999999999999s)]
*  They were released as well. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  All of these hostages have been through a terrible ordeal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  And this is the beginning of a long journey of healing for them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=85.02000000000001s)]
*  The teddy bears waiting to greet those children at the hospital are a stark reminder of the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=88.82000000000001s)]
*  trauma these children have been through at such a very young age. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=94.62s)]
*  Jill and I, your children with me, are keeping them all in our prayers today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=99.5s)]
*  Today has been a product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=103.86000000000001s)]
*  From the moment Hamas kidnapped these people, I, along with my team, have worked around [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  the clock to secure the release. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=113.38s)]
*  We saw the first result of this effort with the release of two American hostages in late [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=115.86s)]
*  October, followed by the release of two Israeli hostages. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=120.3s)]
*  I've consistently pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons, to accelerate and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  expand humanitarian assistance going into Gaza, and two, to facilitate the release of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=129.82s)]
*  hostages. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=135.1s)]
*  And over the past several weeks, I've spoken repeatedly with the Emir of Qatar, the President [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=136.1s)]
*  of the United States, the Prime Minister of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=141.94s)]
*  to help secure this deal, to nail it down. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=145.22s)]
*  And I want to thank all three leaders for their personal partnership to get this done. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=147.66s)]
*  I spoke with the Emir and President al-Sisi and the Prime Minister Netanyahu again on [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=152.66s)]
*  Wednesday to confirm the elements of the engagement. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=157.29999999999998s)]
*  As I said, today's release are the start of a process. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=160.94s)]
*  We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow, and more the day after, and more the day after [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=170.29999999999998s)]
*  Over the next few days, we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=171.70000000000002s)]
*  We also remember all those who are still being held, and renew our commitment to work for [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=176.62s)]
*  their release as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=180.82000000000002s)]
*  Two American women and one four-year-old child, Abigail, who remains among those missing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=182.82000000000002s)]
*  We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=189.02s)]
*  whereabouts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=194.66000000000003s)]
*  I remain in personal contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt, and Israel to make sure [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  that this stays on track and every aspect of the deal is implemented. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=200.86s)]
*  You know, this extended pause in the fighting brings a critical opportunity to deliver much [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=204.86s)]
*  needed food, medicine, water, and fuel to the civilians in Gaza. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=210.82000000000002s)]
*  And we are not wasting one single minute. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=216.3s)]
*  Since my trip to Israel last month, I've been focused on accelerating the delivery of humanitarian [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=219.38000000000002s)]
*  assistance to Gaza in coordination with the United Nations and the Red Cross. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=224.06s)]
*  I just spoke with my special envoy for the Middle East Humanitarian Initiative, David [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=229.34s)]
*  Satterfield, for an update, and I've asked him to monitor our progress hour by hour and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=233.38s)]
*  keep me personally informed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=238.74s)]
*  From the beginning, we put in place mechanisms to prevent Hamas from diverting these supplies, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=240.46s)]
*  and we're continuing that effort to make sure aid gets to the people who need it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=247.34s)]
*  More than 200 trucks arrived at the crossing point in Egypt and into Gaza today. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=253.54s)]
*  These trucks carry food and medicine, as well as fuel, fuel and cooking gas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=258.18s)]
*  The fuel will be used not only to power the trucks delivering these life-saving supplies, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=263.74s)]
*  but for desalinization, for water wells, for hospitals, and for bakeries. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=268.82s)]
*  And hundreds more trucks are getting in position as well, ready to enter Gaza over the coming [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=275.12s)]
*  days to support the innocent Palestinians who are suffering greatly because of this war [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=279.86s)]
*  that Hamas has unleashed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=285.22s)]
*  Hamas doesn't give a damn about them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=287.34s)]
*  We also look to the future. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=289.82s)]
*  As we look to the future, we have to end this cycle of violence in the Middle East. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=291.46s)]
*  We need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=295.7s)]
*  can one day live side by side in a two-state solution with equal measure of freedom and [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=300.66s)]
*  dignity. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=306.3s)]
*  Two states for two peoples. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=307.3s)]
*  And it's more important now than ever. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=309.1s)]
*  Hamas unleashed this terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than Israelis and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=312.14s)]
*  Palestinians living side by side in peace. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=316.7s)]
*  You know, to continue down the path of terror and violence and killing in war is to give [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=319.65999999999997s)]
*  Hamas what they seek. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=325.74s)]
*  And we can't do that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=327.34s)]
*  So today, let's continue to be thankful for all the families who are now and those who [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  will soon be brought together again. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=335.78s)]
*  And I want to once again thank the Emir of Qatar, President Sisi of Egypt, and Prime [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=338.06s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu for their partnership to make what we've done so far possible and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=344.38s)]
*  for their continued leadership as we all keep working to implement this deal. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=348.22s)]
*  And over the coming days, I'll remain engaged with leaders throughout the Middle East as [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=353.1s)]
*  we all work together to build a better future for the region. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=358.66s)]
*  A future where this kind of violence is unthinkable. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=361.74s)]
*  A future where all children in the region, every child, Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Israeli, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=365.42s)]
*  Palestinian, Arab, grow up knowing only peace. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=371.74s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=375.65999999999997s)]
*  We're waiting now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  It's just a matter of, I thought, maybe even as soon as by the time I got here. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=377.65999999999997s)]
*  But in the next hour or so, we'll know what the second wave of releases are. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=382.42s)]
*  And I'm hopeful that it's as well as we anticipate. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=386.3s)]
*  So thank you all for listening. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=389.94s)]
*  I'll take a few questions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=391.42s)]
*  We don't know when that will occur, but we're going to be expecting that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=392.42s)]
*  It's expected to occur. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=401.42s)]
*  And we don't know what the list of all the hostages are and when they'll be released. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=402.94s)]
*  But we know the numbers are going to be released. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=407.58s)]
*  So my hope and expectation will be soon. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=409.94s)]
*  We don't know all of the conditions. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=412.94s)]
*  I've encouraged the prime minister to focus on trying to reduce the number of casualties [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=418.82s)]
*  while he is attempting to eliminate Hamas, which is a legitimate objective he has. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=425.82s)]
*  That's a difficult task. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=436.5s)]
*  And I don't know how long it will take. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=441.5s)]
*  My expectation and hope is that Hamas will be able to do that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=444.5s)]
*  And I don't know how long it will take. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=451.5s)]
*  My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=454.5s)]
*  region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=460.1s)]
*  as quickly as we can. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=467.1s)]
*  I think the chances are real. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=474.1s)]
*  Well, I think that's a worthwhile thought, but I don't think if I started off with that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=475.70000000000005s)]
*  we'd ever gotten to where we are today. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=493.38s)]
*  We have to take this a piece of the time. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=495.38s)]
*  I don't trust Hamas to do anything right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=501.06s)]
*  I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=504.5s)]
*  I'm hearing a lot, but I'm not going to speak to it right now. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=515.02s)]
*  There's an overwhelming desire on the part of the region to... [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=518.02s)]
*  Let me back up. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=523.02s)]
*  I cannot prove what I'm about to say. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=524.94s)]
*  But I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew that I [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=527.58s)]
*  was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region to bring peace to the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=532.22s)]
*  region by having recognition of Israel and Israel's right to exist. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  You may recall when we did the G-20 a little while ago, I was able to get a resolution, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=543.26s)]
*  a statement passed through there saying we're going to build a railroad from Riyadh all [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=549.26s)]
*  the way through the Middle East into Saudi Arabia, Israel, et cetera, and all the way [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yhU4tihI44&t=554.26s)]
