# Fareed Zakaria: Does anyone believe in free speech anymore?
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE)
*  Hamas' terrorist attacks against Israel and Israel's military actions in Gaza have unleashed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=0.0s)]
*  a firestorm of controversy in the United States and Europe. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=5.64s)]
*  Watching it all, I do wonder, does anyone believe in free speech anymore? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=9.38s)]
*  Now, to note, I have strongly condemned the attacks of October 7th, but I think those [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=14.8s)]
*  that praise Hamas in any way are blind to the reality that it has been the principal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=20.34s)]
*  opponent of a two-state solution to the Israeli balance. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=25.68s)]
*  The question to grapple with is how to handle views that either side finds deeply offensive. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=30.72s)]
*  And, of course, speech and assembly are not the same as physical intimidation and harassment, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  which prevent civil discourse. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=43.739999999999995s)]
*  Until very recently, most concerns about free speech on college campuses were related to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=46.64s)]
*  conservative speakers from Ben Shapiro to Condoleezza Rice being protested or disinvited. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=51.8s)]
*  Conservative state legislators introduced dozens of laws to protect campus free speech. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=58.8s)]
*  In 2021, House Republicans started a campus free speech caucus to protect free expression [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  and free association. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=69.84s)]
*  In January 2021, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said, the most important legislative issue [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=71.84s)]
*  to get right in the next couple of years was the protection of controversial speech. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=78.26s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=83.9s)]
*  Late last month, DeSantis reversed course directing Florida State University's chancellor [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=85.28s)]
*  to close down campus chapters of Students for Justice and Palestine. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=90.7s)]
*  DeSantis accused the group of giving material support to terrorism, though as far as I can [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=95.58000000000001s)]
*  tell, these groups have only organized protests and rallies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  As the GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has pointed out, courts have made clear that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=103.96s)]
*  verbal support for extremist groups is very different and constitutionally protected from [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=109.11999999999999s)]
*  sending money, material or arms. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=115.36s)]
*  Other conservatives have tried to publicly identify and shame students belonging to groups [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=119.16s)]
*  that voice support for Hamas. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=124.44s)]
*  A hedge fund manager proposed circulating lists of these students to ensure that they [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  don't get jobs. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=131.34s)]
*  Many donors have demanded that universities issue statements either condemning Hamas or [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=133.16s)]
*  supporting Israel, some even insisting that certain rallies and speakers be banned. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=137.74s)]
*  Many college presidents issued follow-up statements when their original responses were not seen [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  as sufficiently strong in their support of Israel or denunciation of Hamas. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=148.46s)]
*  This is all a far cry from where universities used to be. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  In 1967, in the midst of the passions of the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=158.44s)]
*  a report by a University of Chicago committee chaired by the eminent legal scholar Harry [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Calvin eloquently argued that the mission of the university could not be fulfilled if [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=171.0s)]
*  the institution formally took positions on controversial political issues of the day. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=177.52s)]
*  The committee wrote, a university, if it's to be true to its faith in intellectual inquiry, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=183.62s)]
*  must embrace, be hospitable to, and encourage the widest diversity of views within its own [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=189.62s)]
*  community. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=196.62s)]
*  It is a community, but only for the limited or be great purposes of teaching and research. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=197.62s)]
*  It is not a club, it is not a trade association, it is not a lobby. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=203.84s)]
*  Simply put, the university is the home and sponsor of critics. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=208.7s)]
*  It is not itself the critic. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=213.46s)]
*  The basic argument for free speech, espoused by the Calvin Report, is that it is better [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=216.06s)]
*  to hear those you violently disagree with than to ban them or silence them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=220.22s)]
*  That way, debate happens out in the open, points are matched with counterpoints, the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=225.78s)]
*  alternative is to drive discourse into the shadows and gutters of political life, where [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=230.66s)]
*  it festers, turns into conspiracy theories, and often erupts into violence. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=236.14000000000001s)]
*  Growing up in India, I read with wonder about the United States' commitment to freedom of [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=242.9s)]
*  speech which was so strong that in 1977, a court ruled that a group of Nazis should be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=246.94s)]
*  allowed to march in Skokie, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=253.42000000000002s)]
*  In the 1970s, the Harvard Crimson ran editorials praising Pol Pot's takeover in Cambodia. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=257.5s)]
*  I went to college in the early 80s, an era in which it was not unusual to hear incendiary [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=264.62s)]
*  views on campus, from communist revolutionaries to the Nobel Prize winning scientist William [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=269.14s)]
*  Shockley who made crude arguments about the racial inferiority of black people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=274.62s)]
*  In this century, I recall very few colleges making official statements about the Iraq [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=280.02s)]
*  War or even the terrorist attacks of 9-11. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  We are now in a different world. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=289.06s)]
*  In recent years, the pressure on universities to take political positions has grown. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=291.5s)]
*  A turning point might have been the murder of George Floyd when many institutions decided [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=296.46s)]
*  to demonstrate their sensitivity and issue statements. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=302.82s)]
*  Once they took a stand on one political issue, it is perfectly understandable that they have [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=306.86s)]
*  been also asked to condemn Hamas' attack last month. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=311.78s)]
*  But where will it end? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=315.26s)]
*  A Pandora's box has been opened. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=316.9s)]
*  With every major political event, university administrators will have to decide whether [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=318.9s)]
*  to condemn or support it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=323.9s)]
*  Will they find some standard by which they can explain why they denounced one terrorist [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=326.38s)]
*  attack or human rights abuse, but not another? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=330.85999999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure what it signifies that many of us find the embrace of free speech outlined [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=335.38s)]
*  in the Calvin Report to be too cold in its neutrality. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=340.85999999999996s)]
*  We want our institutions to endorse our own passions and points of view. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=345.62s)]
*  But can they do that in a diverse society in which people disagree so strongly on so [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=351.22s)]
*  much? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=356.86s)]
*  I fear that far from bringing us together, the path we are on will drive us further apart. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gw8OFkD_iE&t=358.7s)]
