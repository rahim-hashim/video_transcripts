# See eyewitness account of one of the last doctors inside besieged Gaza hospital
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s)
*  In northern Gaza, only two hospitals remain open [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=0.0s)]
*  amid Israel's military offensive, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=3.36s)]
*  and they're barely functioning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=5.44s)]
*  One of the last remaining doctors has been documenting [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=7.04s)]
*  what he calls an utterly catastrophic situation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=9.44s)]
*  CNN's Jemana Karacha walks us through his eyewitness account, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=12.96s)]
*  and we want to warn our viewers some of the footage [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=16.56s)]
*  in her reports are graphic and disturbing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=18.96s)]
*  This is the story of a hospital brought to its knees [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=23.04s)]
*  and the man trying to save it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=26.32s)]
*  We're facing a new challenge, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=30.0s)]
*  and the situation is likely to be in the coming hours. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=31.6s)]
*  I'm a volunteer, so I have to be there, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=35.28s)]
*  even if it's just a child. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=37.92s)]
*  I deserve this moment, I didn't sleep with anyone. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  The operation was a terrible thing, it didn't work. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=41.44s)]
*  Some of the desperate cries for help from Dr. Hussam al-Sofia, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=50.24s)]
*  he's one of the last doctors in northern Gaza. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=54.56s)]
*  For weeks, he's been documenting the horror inside Kamal Adwan. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=57.52s)]
*  He wants us to share his account with the world. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=63.52s)]
*  Outside his hospital, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  a renewed major Israeli offensive that began in early October [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=71.12s)]
*  on what's left of northern Gaza. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  To destroy a resurgent Hamas, the military says. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=77.2s)]
*  It's ordered civilians out for their safety. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=80.80000000000001s)]
*  But Israel's been accused of besieging the civilian population. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=83.68s)]
*  Human Rights Watch says this could amount to ethnic cleansing, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=87.68s)]
*  something the military denies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  Inside Dr. Abu Safia's hospital, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=114.56s)]
*  they struggled to cope with the constant influx of casualties. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  A Palestinian journalist captured these scenes of panic in mid-October. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=121.04s)]
*  And on October 24, the Israeli military [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=139.52s)]
*  closed in on Kamal Adwan compound. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=142.32s)]
*  The next few days, this place of healing would itself become a war zone. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=149.84s)]
*  It's the third time in a year that Dr. Abu Safia, a pediatrician, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=160.72s)]
*  finds himself and his hospital surrounded and under attack. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=165.12s)]
*  They're running dangerously low on supplies, fuel and food. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=169.28s)]
*  The Israeli military says it allows aid in, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=173.76s)]
*  but the UN says it's nowhere near enough. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  This, one of the few convoys that have reached Kamal Adwan. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=179.76s)]
*  The IDF ordered civilians who'd been sheltering here to evacuate. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=189.36s)]
*  They hold up white flags and whatever they can carry. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=193.36s)]
*  Dozens were detained, including more than 40 medical personnel, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=196.72s)]
*  some seen in these photos posted to social media. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=200.24s)]
*  Dr. Abu Safia, here with his hands up in the air, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=205.2s)]
*  says he was interrogated for hours. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=208.32s)]
*  Still, Abu Safia refused to abandon his patients. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=226.56s)]
*  What followed appeared to be a brief lull. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=250.8s)]
*  That's when families began to find the bodies of loved ones in and around the hospital compound. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=253.36s)]
*  Dr. Abesafia was attending to the injured and he was called outside. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=259.56s)]
*  His 21-year-old son Ibrahim was killed in an Israeli strike at the hospital gates. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=264.56s)]
*  He tries to lead the funeral prayers but it's just too much. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=282.56s)]
*  In the hospital's makeshift graveyard he buried his boy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=290.56s)]
*  Ibrahim is still close to him in a place that's testament to this one man's struggle. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=297.56s)]
*  In a statement to CNN, the IDF did not address Ibrahim's death but said its operations in the area were quote, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=313.56s)]
*  based on precise intelligence and that dozens of terrorists were found hiding inside the hospital, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=321.56s)]
*  some of them even posing as medical staff. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=327.56s)]
*  It says this is a medic in custody and that he's admitted that Hamas is operating inside Kamal Adwan. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=331.56s)]
*  CNN cannot verify these allegations. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=338.56s)]
*  The IDF has also released these images of weapons it says it found inside the hospital. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=342.56s)]
*  Dr. Abesafia says they belong to its security guards. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=348.56s)]
*  Israeli militaries long rationalized targeting Gaza's health facilities by accusing Hamas of using them for quote, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=352.56s)]
*  terror activities. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=359.56s)]
*  Days after the IDF said its operations at Kamal Adwan concluded, its attacks did not. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=361.56s)]
*  The everyday for these medics now working under fire. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=373.56s)]
*  It's hard to believe this once was one of Gaza's top health care facilities. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=380.56s)]
*  There's so much to see. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=388.56s)]
*  The IDF is now investigating the attacks. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=391.56s)]
*  It's hard to believe this once was one of Gaza's top health care facilities. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=397.56s)]
*  There's no doubt about the kind of firepower unleashed here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=402.56s)]
*  The storage room left charred. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=408.56s)]
*  The walls of the neonatal ICU pockmarked with bullet holes. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=411.56s)]
*  Ambulances crushed. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=416.56s)]
*  Kamal Adwan, like most of Gaza's hospitals, now barely functioning. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=419.56s)]
*  This is a fight for survival and giving up is not an option for Dr. Abesafia. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=439.56s)]
*  Strikes on the hospital left him and others injured this week. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=445.56s)]
*  Paying the price for staying, abandoned and alone in this nightmare on repeat. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=449.56s)]
*  Jemana Karachi, CNN, London. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=455.56s)]
*  The Israeli military told CNN that it is unaware of the strike that injured the doctor. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=459.56s)]
*  The IDF also says it adheres to international law, only goes after military targets, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=464.56s)]
*  and that it takes all necessary measures to avoid harming civilians. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98B1xtxv9s&t=469.56s)]
