# Intense bombardment on Gaza City picks up during on-air segment. See the live pictures
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM)
*  Right now we are seeing smoke coming out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=0.0s)]
*  We're looking at these live pictures of Gaza City. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=3.84s)]
*  We're seeing smoke coming out of Gaza City at this moment. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  What do you believe could be happening right now? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=10.0s)]
*  As we are talking about this, we've seen already quite a few airstrikes occurring in Israel [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  throughout Gaza, but the vast concentration of them are in Gaza City. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=21.92s)]
*  What do you think is happening tonight? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=26.16s)]
*  The smoke that you're seeing right now, that's a result of direct F-15 and F-35, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=28.0s)]
*  Israeli Air Force selective fire. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=33.4s)]
*  There's special operations Air Force commandos, a unit called Sheldag, very elite tier one asset. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=35.36s)]
*  It's called the Kingfisher unit. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=41.32s)]
*  And they are on the ground helping to put those missiles into specific Hamas buildings [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=43.2s)]
*  to completely dismantle Hamas's infrastructure so that it mobilizes them completely. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=50.92s)]
*  That's what the smoke is from. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=56.92s)]
*  The other thing, the reason why this is happening at night, it allows clandestine operations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=58.120000000000005s)]
*  to be conducted within Gaza using deception for operatives to be able to get inside there, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=63.24s)]
*  tapping cell phones, putting down recording devices. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=69.8s)]
*  So Israel is setting an entire prerate operation here for two things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=72.36s)]
*  One, for when that counteroffensive starts, and then two, and the most important thing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  for us, be able to get those hostages back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a listen here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=85.6s)]
*  You can hear those bombs going off in the background in Gaza City. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=86.8s)]
*  We don't always hear or see at this time of night quite a lot. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=96.44s)]
*  Oh, if you're on the ground right now, you're feeling that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=102.16s)]
*  But you can... [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=103.16s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=104.16s)]
*  Can you even tell, based on listening to that, the force, the magnitude of what they are... [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=105.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, there's going to be a lot of destruction. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=109.52s)]
*  A lot of people are going to get killed and hurt. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=112.28s)]
*  It's happening on the Israeli side, on the Palestinian side. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=114.28s)]
*  So I want to make something really clear. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=116.4s)]
*  Israel has no issues with the Palestinian people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=117.4s)]
*  In fact, the Palestinian people ideally would want to be able to cross the southern border [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=119.2s)]
*  of Gaza to get into Egypt, but they can't. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=123.72s)]
*  Hamas is keeping them closed in there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=126.44s)]
*  And like what's-his-name said, that is a problem if they're starting to be used as human shields, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=128.32s)]
*  and it creates immense levels of risk to the Palestinians. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=135.16s)]
*  And so we do our best to follow international law. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=140.36s)]
*  When we look at the before and after of some of these spaces, it looks like just an enormous [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=144.04s)]
*  amount of rubble. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=150.24s)]
*  Do you see a tactical strategy in the flattening of some of these buildings? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=151.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=157.4s)]
*  All of that? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=158.4s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=159.4s)]
*  So the flattening of the structures, the artillery pieces that are going in there, they're starting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=160.4s)]
*  to open up lanes, if you will, for this massive counteroffensive that's being prepared. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=163.72s)]
*  The other thing that we're doing is we're tiring out Hamas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=170.0s)]
*  We're treating this as what we call like a pressure cooker. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=173.48s)]
*  In Hebrew we call it a sir lachatz. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=175.6s)]
*  And that pressure cooker is designed to try and slow things down so that we can collect [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=177.48s)]
*  intelligence and so that we can tire out this terror group. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=181.68s)]
*  And a tired terrorist is a better terrorist who's holding innocent women and children. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=185.6s)]
*  So taking our time and doing the best we can to collect info, trying to slow this thing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=191.76s)]
*  Opening up lanes for the Givati Brigade, which is equivalent to the U.S. Marines. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=195.84s)]
*  They're the ones who are in charge of the Southern Command. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=200.12s)]
*  And they're the ones who have been into Gaza previously in the last war in Gaza. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=203.32s)]
*  And so they're opening up parting ways, if you will, so that the Israelis will be able [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=207.32s)]
*  to move in there as safely as possible to get to the terrorists. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Is it safe to describe what we are seeing tonight and hearing tonight in the skies over [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=219.6s)]
*  Gaza as a prelude potentially to a ground invasion? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  I can tell you that a ground invasion is imminent. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=230.88s)]
*  When it's going to happen, I couldn't tell you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=235.0s)]
*  I'm not going to speculate and I don't want to give out any information that might be [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=238.48s)]
*  inaccurate. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  But the fact that 300,000 reservists have been mobilized, the fact that the Givati Brigade [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  is down there, the fact that the Israeli SEALs are already operating on that coast, you can [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=248.12s)]
*  bet that they're preparing for the inevitability of having to go in there. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  And the unfortunate part, like Anderson said very gently and eloquently, it's going to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=257.36s)]
*  be vicious. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=263.8s)]
*  You can hear the missile fire. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=264.8s)]
*  You can hear that hitting the rubble. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=267.88s)]
*  There's going to be a lot of violence of action. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=270.24s)]
*  There will be a lot of death and trauma, but we believe there could be over 150 hostages [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  in there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=280.72s)]
*  So we're looking at two multiple assaults. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=281.72s)]
*  And Aaron, I just want to emphasize for our viewers, if you've been joining us nightly, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  we do not always hear bombardment at this hour of this strength. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  This seems to be war. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=296.6s)]
*  There's intense fighting that's happening right now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=299.44s)]
*  I hear artillery pieces that are going off. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=301.8s)]
*  Again, that's to soften and open up the runways for those infantry units that will eventually [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  go in. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=311.0s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer right now also. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=312.0s)]
*  And the other thing we're hearing is that selective missile fire. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  There's potentially Israelis inside Gaza right now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=320.0s)]
*  These are special operations forces. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=321.6s)]
*  They're doing everything they can to get intelligence, to prepare for the counteroffensive. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=323.04s)]
*  And unfortunately, this is the price that Israelis pay and that Palestinians pay. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=327.92s)]
*  Let's listen for just a moment. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=334.32s)]
*  As you just said, this is the call to prayer. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=335.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=387.92s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=391.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=394.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=397.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=400.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=403.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=406.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=409.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=412.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=418.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=421.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=424.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=427.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=430.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=433.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=436.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=439.32s)]
*  I hear the call to prayer. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=442.32s)]
*  You're listening and watching. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=445.32s)]
*  These are images of Gaza City as the bombs light up the night sky there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=455.12s)]
*  We're hearing what sounds like a call to prayer, even some sirens in a few moments [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=461.02s)]
*  ago, as the bombs are dropping right now. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=465.71999999999997s)]
*  This is the population center of Gaza. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=468.4s)]
*  Almost 600,000 people live here. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=472.62s)]
*  The intensity of the bombardment seems to have picked up just in the last couple of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=475.62s)]
*  minutes as we've been speaking to you and watching these images. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=479.42s)]
*  It's a sign, according to my guest here, Aaron Cohen, that potentially this is picking up. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=483.22s)]
*  As he says, as you've said, Aaron, perhaps a sign that this ground invasion could be [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=490.82s)]
*  imminent as the Israeli Defense Forces are moving more aggressively, it seems, tonight [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=497.82000000000005s)]
*  to prepare, to soften this ground for the some 300,000 troops who are amassed along [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=503.42s)]
*  the border, get ready to go in. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=513.4200000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=515.82s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=516.82s)]
*  Gaza is an incredibly densely populated area. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=519.82s)]
*  Hamas has had years to keep building it up. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=523.02s)]
*  This is one of the most dangerous places on earth. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=526.82s)]
*  I just want to make it really clear. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=528.62s)]
*  The Israelis, as an IDF soldier, as a veteran of the IDF, we don't have an issue with the [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=531.0200000000001s)]
*  Palestinians and we want to do what we can to get Hamas away from them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=537.82s)]
*  And so we're going to use as much selectivity. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=544.12s)]
*  The difference with the footage that you were showing is that we're not going to indiscriminately [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=546.22s)]
*  hurt anybody. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=550.7800000000001s)]
*  However, lines have been crossed and decisions have been made. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=552.0200000000001s)]
*  Leadership will roll. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPjz71xR7SM&t=556.22s)]
