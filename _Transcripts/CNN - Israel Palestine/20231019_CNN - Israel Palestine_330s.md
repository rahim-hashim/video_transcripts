# Lebanese militant groups and Israel exchange fire across border
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo)
*  The Israel Defense Forces say it is seeing a significant escalation on the border with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=0.0s)]
*  Lebanon and has been striking back after some 20 rockets or so were fired toward Israel. Today, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=5.12s)]
*  the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah says it also attacked five Israeli military posts. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=10.96s)]
*  A spokesperson for the IDF says that it tells CNN that Hezbollah is trying to drag Lebanon into the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=16.64s)]
*  conflict, certainly something people in the region have been worried about. CNN's Ben Wiedemann is in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=22.72s)]
*  southern Lebanon for CNN right now. Ben, what have you been seeing as there is this concern that if [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=27.76s)]
*  Israel does, if and when, embark on this ground invasion, that the fighting could increase and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=33.2s)]
*  then Lebanon could get pulled into this war? Now, Caitlin, we're hearing a lot of this cross-border [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=37.92s)]
*  fire today. It wasn't just Hezbollah that was focusing mainly on Israeli military positions [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=45.28s)]
*  along the border, but also the military wing of Hamas got involved and they claimed to have [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  fired 30 rockets into the upper Galilee region. But it's important to keep in mind that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=57.2s)]
*  even though certainly we are seeing more cross-border fire in this area than perhaps 2006 [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  during that war back then, but Hezbollah is being very careful to keep it within certain limits to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=73.36s)]
*  avoid a full-scale war. It seems to be wanting to show that it is supporting Hamas by doing some [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=81.84s)]
*  action here without going all the way. Keep in mind that just a few months ago, the Israeli [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=89.92s)]
*  defense minister said that if Hezbollah decides to launch a war on Israel, Israel will bomb Lebanon [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=95.68s)]
*  back into the Stone Age. So there is a certain hesitance and certainly in this area where we are, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=104.16s)]
*  there is nervousness about the possibility of a full-scale war. We spoke with a shopkeeper here [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=110.72s)]
*  who told us that he has his bags packed in his car ready to go in the event that things [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=116.8s)]
*  go really south. So there is nervousness, but at the moment I think a certain level of violence [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=124.8s)]
*  without going too far is being maintained here. Caitlin? Yeah, and that's really interesting given [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=131.2s)]
*  if you see these strikes going back and forth, something you say we haven't seen in 20 years, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=140.08s)]
*  and I should note we are hearing a little bit of activity here right now in Tel Aviv, we will be [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=144.24s)]
*  monitoring that. But you are saying what Hezbollah is doing is maybe a little bit, but not enough to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=148.0s)]
*  provoke Israel. Is that the sense of what is actually happening on the ground, what their [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=153.76s)]
*  decision-making is? Yes, they are doing. What we are seeing really in terms of Hezbollah's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=158.32s)]
*  capabilities is really just the tip of the iceberg. These are very localized attacks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=166.64s)]
*  They are not lobbying missiles in the direction of large Israeli population centers. We are getting, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah is putting out videos every day. They seem to be focusing on communications, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  surveillance, and observation equipment on the Israeli side, occasionally hitting tanks and troops [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=186.64s)]
*  as well. But it's really very military in its focus, not what we are seeing, for instance, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  coming out of Gaza. This is very specific. Caitlin? Yeah, and clearly the U.S. government, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=200.4s)]
*  though, seems worried that it could go from this state of where it is right now to something bigger [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=209.84s)]
*  because this warning came out from the State Department telling Americans who are in Lebanon, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=214.88000000000002s)]
*  leave the country as soon as possible. They are worried there may not be commercial options to do [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=219.12s)]
*  so in the near stage, I guess. Have you sensed a change in how people feel? Are they going about [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=223.84s)]
*  everyday life or do you sense something different since you have been on the ground? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=230.96s)]
*  Well, certainly in this area, along the border, there is nervousness. Some people have already [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=237.6s)]
*  left. Others have left and come back because they can't afford to hang out in hotels in Beirut. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=242.4s)]
*  But certainly in general, if you're talking about Lebanon, there is nervousness. And it's not just [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=248.72s)]
*  the U.S. government. The U.K., Germany, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and others have told their nationals [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=253.84s)]
*  in Lebanon that it's a good time to leave now while there's still flights. Keep in mind that in 2006, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=262.16s)]
*  at the beginning of the war between Hezbollah and Israel, one of the first things Israel struck [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=268.88s)]
*  was the airport in Beirut. It's also important to keep in mind that when we're talking about [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=275.2s)]
*  nationals of the U.S., Australia, U.K., Germany, Canada, and whatnot, there are hundreds of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=280.96s)]
*  thousands of Lebanese who have dual passports. So it's not just tourists who are here or [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=288.16s)]
*  businessmen. There are a lot of Lebanese who hold these passports as well. And in 2006, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=294.48s)]
*  all of these countries had to send ships to take their nationals out. And so we're talking about [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=301.6s)]
*  not just a few thousand. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who, in theory, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  should leave. But many of them are obviously connected to their land, their homeland, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  and won't be leaving. But we're not talking about a small number of people. Caitlin? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=318.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. A difficult decision for a region that is certainly on edge. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG8UShiEHYo&t=325.44s)]
