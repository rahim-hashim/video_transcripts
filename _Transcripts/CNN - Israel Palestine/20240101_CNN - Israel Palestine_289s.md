# Israel's Supreme Court strikes down controversial change to judiciary
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA)
*  Now to some breaking news from Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court has struck down a controversial change [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=2.4s)]
*  to the judiciary, one that's ignited deep divisions [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=5.92s)]
*  within the nation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=9.16s)]
*  Let's get right to Elliot Gottkin in Tel Aviv for us now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Elliot, this refers specifically to a proposed amendment [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=13.92s)]
*  that would have stripped the Supreme Court of its ability [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  to declare government decisions as unreasonable. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=20.16s)]
*  It's a fascinating ruling, flies in the face of efforts [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=23.52s)]
*  by Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=26.16s)]
*  I think the big question here is, will he stand [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=27.56s)]
*  by the Supreme Court's ruling? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  Julia, that's an open question. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=34.68s)]
*  He has in the past, including to our very own Wolf Blitzer, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=36.76s)]
*  avoided directly answering that question. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=39.68s)]
*  But make no mistake, this is an unprecedented decision [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=42.96s)]
*  by the Supreme Court. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=46.0s)]
*  Never before has it struck down a basic law or an amendment [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=47.16s)]
*  to a basic law, which is the closest thing that Israel [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  has to a constitution. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=55.04s)]
*  And what Prime Minister Netanyahu's government did [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=56.36s)]
*  is it came out with this judicial overhaul, which, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  as you said, caused months of very deep divisions, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=61.68s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people on the streets protesting. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=64.76s)]
*  At one point, he sacked his defense minister [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=67.8s)]
*  for suggesting that he pause this legislation [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=70.36s)]
*  and then quietly forgot that he'd sacked him. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=73.16s)]
*  And of course, Defense Minister Yoav Galant, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=75.24s)]
*  somewhat busy right now with the war with Hamas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=77.52s)]
*  And so this is an incredibly significant decision. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=80.84s)]
*  It was a very narrow ruling, 8 to 7, against the government. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=83.4s)]
*  And what Netanyahu wanted to do was, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=86.76s)]
*  and what they did in fact do, because it's a law that's now [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=89.04s)]
*  been struck down, it did come into effect for a few months [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  and it's now been struck down. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=94.48s)]
*  Netanyahu wanted to remove the Supreme Court's ability [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  to strike down government decisions [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=99.68s)]
*  on the grounds of reasonableness. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  And I'll just give you one example [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  that was very relevant at the beginning [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=104.44s)]
*  of this government's tenure, which [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=105.68s)]
*  is its attempts to appoint a minister called Ari Ederi, who [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  is from Netanyahu's ally. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  He's one of Netanyahu's allies. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=112.12s)]
*  Ari Ederi's party, Shas, is in the governing coalition. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu wanted to make Ari Ederi a minister, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=118.64s)]
*  but he's been convicted three times, most recently [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  for tax fraud. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=123.4s)]
*  The Supreme Court said, no, it's unreasonable to make him [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=124.4s)]
*  a decision because of his convictions. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  And as a result, he wasn't made a minister. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=129.4s)]
*  So what this means in future now is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=131.76s)]
*  that the Supreme Court will continue [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=134.08s)]
*  to have the power to strike down decisions such as those [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  on the grounds of reasonableness. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=139.32s)]
*  It will be seen as a victory for opponents of Netanyahu [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=140.88s)]
*  and all those hundreds of thousands of people [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=143.92s)]
*  who are out on the streets week in, week out for months [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  on end protesting against the government's plans [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=149.4s)]
*  to weaken the Supreme Court. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=151.88s)]
*  It will, of course, also be seen as a loss [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=153.84s)]
*  on the part of Netanyahu's government's supporters. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=156.44s)]
*  We're not seeing any signs of protest right now. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=159.76s)]
*  Of course, Israel is in the middle of that war with Hamas. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=161.84s)]
*  And indeed, those divisions that this judicial overhaul created [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=165.16s)]
*  seem to have been not forgotten, but certainly [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  shunted to the side. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=171.72s)]
*  Now this decision could potentially [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=173.16s)]
*  threaten to reopen them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=175.48s)]
*  We've heard from the Justice Minister, Yeriv Levin. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  He was the architect of this judicial overhaul. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=179.92s)]
*  He's already assailed the timing of this decision, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  saying it's the opposite of the unity [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=184.76s)]
*  that Israel needs right now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  But Julia, just one note on that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  The Supreme Court had no decision [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  but to issue its ruling right now [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  because two of the Supreme Court's justices [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  have to step down this month. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=196.64s)]
*  Julia? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=198.84s)]
*  It also could have profound implications for the war, too, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  Elliot, because doesn't it also pit members [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=202.44s)]
*  of the current war cabinet against each other, too, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=204.28s)]
*  based on their views on how this should have played out [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  or shouldn't play out? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=210.8s)]
*  I think, Julia, this war cabinet, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  and we're in particular talking about one [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=215.52s)]
*  of the opposition leaders, Benny Gantz, and his party, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=217.88000000000002s)]
*  which is now in the war cabinet, the judicial overhaul [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=221.08s)]
*  is really not something that they are there to talk about [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  or to discuss. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=228.72s)]
*  It's not even really been talked about. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=229.52s)]
*  It's almost been forgotten very bizarrely. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=230.88s)]
*  It's almost been forgotten as a result of this war [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=233.12s)]
*  and Hamas' terrorist attacks of October the 7th. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=235.44s)]
*  And so, as a result, I don't think it's going to necessarily [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  sow divisions in this war cabinet. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  The country has generally been united in this war with Hamas [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  in the wake of those attacks of October the 7th. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=247.60000000000002s)]
*  And I think that the war cabinet will remain very much focused [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=249.84s)]
*  on the job at hand, which is to destroy Hamas militarily [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=252.84s)]
*  and to get the 100-plus hostages still being held in captivity [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=255.88s)]
*  by Hamas and other groups inside the Gaza Strip [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=259.64s)]
*  for some 80 days now to get them all back home. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=262.56s)]
*  Yes, this is a controversial issue, this judicial overhaul. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=265.64s)]
*  Yes, the Supreme Court ruling is also controversial. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=268.76s)]
*  But I think the war cabinet in particular [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=272.12s)]
*  will remain very much focused because this war, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=274.04s)]
*  certainly from Israel's perspective, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  is more important than this judicial overhaul. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=279.0s)]
*  Julia? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=281.72s)]
*  Yes, a message in there, I think, for the Prime Minister too. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=282.08s)]
*  Perhaps now's not the time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=284.72s)]
*  Elliot Gokin, thank you for that report there. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJe-YtQigkA&t=286.52s)]
