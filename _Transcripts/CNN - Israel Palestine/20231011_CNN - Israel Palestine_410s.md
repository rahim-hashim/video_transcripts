# Gaza's only power station runs out of fuel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E)
*  We want to go now to Gaza because right now in Gaza there is no electricity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=0.0s)]
*  The head of the power authority tells CNN that the one power station has run out of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  fuel and that it's no longer working. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=9.52s)]
*  It's part of Israel's promised siege of the Palestinian enclave. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=11.88s)]
*  And of course the death toll in Gaza as we have it above 1,000 people, injuries mounting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=15.16s)]
*  above 5,000 now, all this together making the humanitarian situation there even more [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=22.2s)]
*  dire for civilians. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=29.1s)]
*  Gaza's hospitals and morgues, we are told, are filling up. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=31.340000000000003s)]
*  CNN's Salma Abdelaziz is following the story from London. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=34.82s)]
*  Salma, tell us what you're learning from the Gaza side of the story. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=37.94s)]
*  And you've just revealed some of those numbers, more than 1,000 killed so far. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=42.22s)]
*  One in 10 Gazans, over nearly a quarter million people essentially have been displaced from [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=47.46s)]
*  their homes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=52.42s)]
*  Hospitals say that they're running on generator power but soon they'll run out of fuel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=53.660000000000004s)]
*  People are overwhelmed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  People have nowhere to go. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=59.22s)]
*  And all of this is only the beginning of a lengthy conflict. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=60.66s)]
*  You heard there from our colleague Jeremy Diamond speaking about the reservists on the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=66.38s)]
*  ground. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=69.5s)]
*  So far all you're seeing is Israel's air assault, a continuous battering of the strip. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=70.5s)]
*  You haven't yet seen a ground encourage and of course that's highly expected and would [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=75.74s)]
*  only amplify the suffering there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  It's important to know that there are about 2 million Gazans, 2 million people who are [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=82.42s)]
*  trapped in that tiny coastal strip. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=86.5s)]
*  There is, even before this conflict, a blockade that's existed there for more than 15 years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=88.69999999999999s)]
*  It imposes travel restrictions that make it nearly impossible for most average people [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=94.61999999999999s)]
*  to leave. And you have to remember that Hamas treats Gaza like it is its own backyard. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=99.38s)]
*  There have been no elections in Gaza for many, many years now since Hamas seized control [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=106.02s)]
*  in 2007. So the people there have no say in what Hamas does. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=112.06s)]
*  But they absolutely bear the brunt of the consequences of this conflict. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=116.34s)]
*  You already have rights groups ringing the alarm saying that the siege that Israel has [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=123.62s)]
*  imposed, cutting off food, cutting off fuel, cutting off water, that that is collective [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=127.66s)]
*  punishment, that it is a violation of international law. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=131.98s)]
*  But Israel is undeterred. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=135.42s)]
*  The defense minister was on the border just a few hours ago meeting with Israeli troops [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=137.3s)]
*  saying the gloves are off. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=142.14s)]
*  There are no restraints. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=143.74s)]
*  Gaza will never be the same again. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=145.5s)]
*  Of course, these words are haunting the many families right now living under bombardment. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=147.78s)]
*  Is there any sense now when we look at these strikes, is Israel still giving warning of [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=154.94s)]
*  the strikes in advance to allow for civilians to move from the buildings, their homes or [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=161.82s)]
*  elsewhere before the bombs drop? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=168.58s)]
*  I think what you're referencing is the knock on the door. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=171.66s)]
*  It's actually a form of strike that, you know, in the past has been used on homes to give [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=174.17999999999998s)]
*  them some warning. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  Actually, an Israeli official was asked about that by CNN and his response was, well, Hamas [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  did not give us a knock before they carried out their surprise attack, before they carried [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=186.26s)]
*  out their assault. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=191.01999999999998s)]
*  So the answer sort of vaguely there being no, civilians are not being given a heads [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=192.22s)]
*  up. We've also heard eyewitness accounts of the same on the ground. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=197.22s)]
*  Israeli officials have also been asked about cutting off food, cutting off fuel, cutting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=200.78s)]
*  off water. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=203.9s)]
*  Is this not collective punishment? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=204.78s)]
*  And their response has also been we cannot be expected to provide for the Gaza Strip [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=206.38s)]
*  while we are at war with the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=212.18s)]
*  And that's absolutely the problem here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=215.06s)]
*  Again, two million people trapped in this deeply impoverished enclave, absolutely caught [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=216.94s)]
*  in the middle. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  They have no say when Hamas fires a rocket, but they will get the vengeance for it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=223.10000000000002s)]
*  And Salma, we've been hearing just awful stories of people who were in Gaza who say, you know, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=228.98s)]
*  they hear from the authorities go to the south, they go to the south, and then the south is [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=233.3s)]
*  hit with airstrikes. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=236.5s)]
*  They hear from authorities go to the north and then the north. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=237.62s)]
*  And so, you know, for all of the folks that are in Gaza, more than two million people, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=239.62s)]
*  just really difficult days ahead. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=244.66s)]
*  Salma Abdulaziz, thank you, Salma. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=245.94s)]
*  And Christian, on the other side of the screen, we can see as the sun is setting in Gaza, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=247.94s)]
*  we can see just how dark it is as they main, the one and only power station in Gaza reports [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=253.42s)]
*  that the power is out and generators that are there, they will have or will soon be [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=258.74s)]
*  running out of fuel. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=264.5s)]
*  This is our first look at what power out in Gaza is going to mean. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=265.62s)]
*  And to your point about how civilians that want to get out of harm's way, want to get [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=270.38s)]
*  out of Gaza, what they're up against in doing so, there are these third-party talks about [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=275.94s)]
*  potentially getting humanitarian corridors out. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=282.1s)]
*  An IDF spokesperson was on with us earlier this earlier in the show, and I asked her [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=285.42s)]
*  where she where the IDF thinks that civilians in Gaza should go if they want to get out [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=291.58s)]
*  of the out of harm's way. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=297.18s)]
*  Let me play what she said. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=298.22s)]
*  First, I would say that if they do receive any kind of advance warning to simply put [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=301.62s)]
*  distance from where they are and go somewhere else, even within the street and beyond [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=305.42s)]
*  that, there is another border that the Gaza Strip has with Egypt. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=310.22s)]
*  And I can't speak to that to that situation at this stage. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=313.62s)]
*  Just showing kind of to your point, the lack of clarity on exactly what it's going to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=319.26000000000005s)]
*  look like going forward. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=324.5s)]
*  It's not open. The other side is not open. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=325.82000000000005s)]
*  And the people in Gaza do not have anywhere to go. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=328.98s)]
*  The Israelis have said they are going to try to warn people when they bomb. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=331.94000000000005s)]
*  But we were talking to a doctor inside Gaza last night who said the warning amounts to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=335.5s)]
*  a sort of a first tap, a quote unquote small rocket warning people. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  And hopefully they can get out in time before the big ones, the big bombs come down and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  level the the buildings, which is what's happened. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=350.94s)]
*  There are, according to the UN, some 150 or so thousand Gazans who've already taken [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=354.7s)]
*  refuge at UN facilities, including UNRWA, as it's called, schools and other such [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=360.94s)]
*  facilities. But that's only a small percentage. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=366.18s)]
*  And I think really it goes to the question that Sarah also asked, what is the endgame? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=369.18s)]
*  Because is, for instance, Hamas setting up traps for Israeli forces as has been warned? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=374.22s)]
*  Does it want to try to drag Israel into a quagmire? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=379.78s)]
*  Does it want to spark a regional conflagration by doing this? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=383.42s)]
*  And more importantly, even if Israel manages to decimate Hamas, then who takes over? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=388.78s)]
*  Does Israel reoccupy? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=394.9s)]
*  Who then? What then? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=396.61999999999995s)]
*  There's so many questions. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=397.94s)]
*  But Israel's aim right now should not be misunderstood. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=400.02s)]
*  It is to retain and regain rather the deterrence that it has lost since Saturday. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0evi5X6jK4E&t=403.09999999999997s)]
