# 85-year-old grandmother freed by Hamas describes being kidnapped
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8)
*  Morning, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to CNN This Morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=0.84s)]
*  I'm Papi Harlow with Phil Mattingly in New York, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=2.04s)]
*  Erin Burnett live with us in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=3.92s)]
*  And that is where a hostage released by Hamas yesterday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=6.08s)]
*  is now speaking. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=9.92s)]
*  She is telling her story. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=11.16s)]
*  This morning at the hospital, 85-year-old Yehevid Lifshitz [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=12.88s)]
*  told reporters how she was abducted and held [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=16.84s)]
*  captive underground for weeks. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=19.56s)]
*  The grandmother says hordes of Hamas fighters [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=21.52s)]
*  stormed her kibbutz during the massacre [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=23.76s)]
*  and took her away on a motorbike and beat her with sticks. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=25.48s)]
*  She says they took her into Hamas's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=29.2s)]
*  underground tunnel network and held her [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=30.96s)]
*  before other hostages. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=32.88s)]
*  They had guards, a doctor, and a paramedic who took care of them [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=34.64s)]
*  and gave them medicine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=37.84s)]
*  She says Hamas had a stockpile of shampoo and other toiletries [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=38.96s)]
*  for hostages to use. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  There are a huge, huge network of tunnels underneath. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=46.96s)]
*  It looks like a spider web. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=54.04s)]
*  When she first arrived, they told them that they are Muslims [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  and they're not going to hurt them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  And that they shared, they ate the same food [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  that Hamas was eating. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=67.52s)]
*  Well, Hamas has now released four hostages. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=73.88s)]
*  As Israeli troops gear up to launch an assault, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=76.12s)]
*  they say, on Gaza by ground, sea, and air. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=78.6s)]
*  The Israeli military says it struck more than 400 targets [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=82.4s)]
*  across Gaza in the past day, killing Hamas commanders [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=85.56s)]
*  and fighters. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=88.72s)]
*  This, as more than 200 hostages, are still [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=89.4s)]
*  believed to be held by Hamas inside Gaza. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  And we've learned that includes 30 children. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=95.08s)]
*  Let's go to Erin Burnett. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=97.28s)]
*  She joins us live again this hour in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=98.36s)]
*  Erin, hearing from her all of those details, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=100.4s)]
*  including, by the way, some criticism of the IDF [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=105.08s)]
*  and lack of preparedness, was remarkable this morning. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=108.64s)]
*  It was remarkable. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=114.2s)]
*  And she did have criticism for the IDF. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  And you know how they obviously weren't there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=116.96s)]
*  Also, Papi, some things stand out [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=121.08s)]
*  in the mundane necessity. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  You're talking about tunnels. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=125.2s)]
*  We know these tunnels have ventilation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  We know that they've been known to have air conditioning. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=127.92s)]
*  This has all been reporting that we've [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=129.76s)]
*  heard from the Israelis over the years. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=131.28s)]
*  But the fact that she's saying she was held underground [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=133.48s)]
*  for more than two weeks, that there was shampoo, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=136.4s)]
*  there was antibiotics, there was a guard per hostage [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=139.64s)]
*  in the experience she had, that there were [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=142.92s)]
*  medics and paramedics. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=146.16s)]
*  And obviously, she is elderly. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=147.44s)]
*  The other woman who was released also elderly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=149.0s)]
*  and had medical needs. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=151.12s)]
*  And that they had the medicine needed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=152.2s)]
*  And if not, something similar to replace it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=153.88s)]
*  It is pretty stunning because you've got to contrast that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=158.32s)]
*  with what's happening above the ground, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=160.8s)]
*  Where there isn't water, nevermind shampoo, okay? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=162.8s)]
*  They don't have water. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=166.4s)]
*  They're using toilet water. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=167.24s)]
*  There is no morphine for any kind of amputations. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=168.28s)]
*  Antibiotics, no, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  But Hamas had stockpiled all of that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  and has all of that underground. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=176.16s)]
*  And that's what we're learning from her. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=177.28s)]
*  Yeah, and to that point, Erin, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=178.92s)]
*  and I want to play the sound from her on this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  because it gets at just how prepared they were [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=181.84s)]
*  for taking hostages, including at the scale [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=185.2s)]
*  that they took them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=187.12s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  They looked very well prepared. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=190.68s)]
*  They prepared it for a long period of time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  All of the needs for female, that women needs, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=196.84s)]
*  shampoo, conditioner. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=200.88s)]
*  Did that surprise you? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=204.64s)]
*  I don't know if everyone was surprised by the scale [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=205.6s)]
*  of the actual terror attack itself, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=207.24s)]
*  but the preparations for hostage taking [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=209.16s)]
*  also seemed to be a significant piece of the plan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=211.28s)]
*  Yes, when they say prepared for things, women's needs, okay? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=216.16s)]
*  They were therefore prepared. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=219.84s)]
*  I mean, let's just go ahead. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=222.48s)]
*  I think we've been honest about it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  That means they had tampons and things, okay? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=224.92s)]
*  That is a level of preparation [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=227.44s)]
*  for what they were going to do, right? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=229.32s)]
*  And it shows that they were gonna take people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=231.52s)]
*  of all different ages, right? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=233.52s)]
*  It shows a preparation for that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=234.88s)]
*  And we saw that in the plans that we've seen taken [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=236.68s)]
*  from the bodies of Hamas militants [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  who were killed in the terrorist attack, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=242.07999999999998s)]
*  that it lays out what they were gonna do [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=244.32s)]
*  in every single kibbutz, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=245.88s)]
*  and it also laid out very explicitly [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=247.16s)]
*  in the ones that I've had a chance to read [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=249.32s)]
*  what they were gonna do with hostages. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=251.48s)]
*  Take as many as possible. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=252.8s)]
*  Here's the communal eating area in this kibbutz. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=254.12s)]
*  This is where they go. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=256.92s)]
*  This is how you get there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=257.76s)]
*  Here's the map. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=258.6s)]
*  It's circled. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=259.44s)]
*  Take the hostages there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=260.48s)]
*  So that was very much a part of the printed plan, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=262.32000000000005s)]
*  and now you see the other end of it, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=264.20000000000005s)]
*  the level of preparation that went into it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=265.92s)]
*  But again, in the mundane reality [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=268.12s)]
*  of having feminine hygiene products, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  shampoo and antibiotics, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  it is those very specifics, I think, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=274.6s)]
*  that are most striking. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=276.32000000000005s)]
*  For sure. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=277.72s)]
*  And Erin, also I wonder if we'll learn from her [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=278.56s)]
*  or some of the other hostages released [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=281.56s)]
*  how much they had, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=283.16s)]
*  which would indicate how long they had been planning [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=284.8s)]
*  or have been planning to hold the hostages. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=287.96s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  I also thought this was striking [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=290.76s)]
*  that her daughter, Sharon, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  spoke at that news conference as well. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=293.76s)]
*  And this is what she said about her dad, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=295.96s)]
*  who of course is Yehavad's husband. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=298.35999999999996s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=300.96s)]
*  My mom and my dad were separated at the very beginning. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=303.79999999999995s)]
*  And so we do not know, from my mom's story, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=308.67999999999995s)]
*  what happened to my dad. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=311.79999999999995s)]
*  We do know that he was injured. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  Injured and very likely could still be being held. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=317.96s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=324.56s)]
*  They were held in separate places. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=325.4s)]
*  So as much as Hamas is again, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=326.76s)]
*  giving this image of humane treatment to hostages, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=328.2s)]
*  you must remember again that they were hostages. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=332.12s)]
*  Remember what happened to the people [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=334.32s)]
*  who didn't get to become hostages, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=335.28s)]
*  the horrible and brutal and inhuman method [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=337.24s)]
*  of their brutal massacre and slaughter. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=339.44s)]
*  But then when they did take people hostages, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=342.67999999999995s)]
*  they would separate. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=344.24s)]
*  So a husband and wife not being together. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=345.4s)]
*  And she doesn't know where he is. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  And that of course raises the obvious point [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=349.76s)]
*  that we don't know where they're being held [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=352.6s)]
*  and are there any being held in larger groups. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=354.64s)]
*  We know Hamas has said that some of the hostages [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=356.36s)]
*  have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=358.88s)]
*  We don't know if they've been killed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=360.88s)]
*  We don't know if they were killed [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  by Israeli airstrikes or anything else. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=362.8s)]
*  But all we know at this point is what Hamas has said. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=364.48s)]
*  They've indicated 22 have been killed in strikes. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=367.36s)]
*  We just don't know if it's true. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=369.64s)]
*  Well, the Israeli forces preparing for the Gaza ground [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  invasion are getting counsel from an American military leader [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=373.44s)]
*  on the ground in Israel. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=375.91999999999996s)]
*  Marine Corps Lieutenant General James Glynn [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=377.64s)]
*  was head of the Marine Forces Special Operations Command. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=379.4s)]
*  And it is unclear though, while of course he has the experience [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=383.0s)]
*  and the resume for such a situation, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  it is unclear what his specific role is here. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=388.15999999999997s)]
*  But an official does say General Glynn of course [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=391.4s)]
*  has decades of experience and can ask what they say [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=393.28s)]
*  are the hard questions. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=396.32s)]
*  As the United States does not have a clear sense [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=397.76s)]
*  of Israel's intentions in Gaza, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=399.79999999999995s)]
*  They said they're gonna get rid of Hamas in all respects. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=402.28s)]
*  But beyond that, what that actually means, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=404.6s)]
*  they have not provided any specifics. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=406.96s)]
*  CNN's Nick Robertson is in Storot, Israel, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=408.96s)]
*  where he has been since the beginning of this war. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=411.0s)]
*  And Nick, as we have been in the midst [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=413.96s)]
*  of what is now 17 days into a war, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=416.24s)]
*  what are you seeing in terms of military movement [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  this morning in the context of what? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=421.52s)]
*  More than 300 strikes that Israel is saying [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=423.52s)]
*  they conducted in the past 24 hours in Gaza? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=426.16s)]
*  Yeah, and just to go back to what you were saying there [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=431.96s)]
*  about the former Marine General, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=435.16s)]
*  I think the other piece of context here of course [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=436.44s)]
*  is the fact that we know that there's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=438.52000000000004s)]
*  a Marine Expeditionary Unit at 2000 [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=439.92s)]
*  who've been on readiness and standby to come in [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=442.56s)]
*  and give logistics support, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=446.12s)]
*  another unspecified support to the Israeli military [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=449.32s)]
*  at a time when there are American hostages [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=453.88s)]
*  on being held by Hamas inside Gaza. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=456.72s)]
*  So it seems, you know, when you pick and choose [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=459.96000000000004s)]
*  which general to come and give what sort of advice, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  you're also picking one who will be very familiar [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=466.48s)]
*  with the sort of expertise, readiness, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  and what these Marines who are sitting just offshore [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=472.56s)]
*  have at their disposal. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=475.76000000000005s)]
*  It speaks to me as coordination as well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=477.12s)]
*  Of course, that's not what we're being told. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=480.88s)]
*  But when it comes to the readiness, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=483.56s)]
*  we heard from the Prime Minister today, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=485.92s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  when he was speaking with the French President [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=488.8s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron, who's given his support [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=490.44s)]
*  to Israel's right to strike back at Hamas, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=492.8s)]
*  the Prime Minister said it could be a long war. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=496.64s)]
*  I'm struck by the fact that he said it could be [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  because until now he's been very, very clear saying [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=502.24s)]
*  we'll go after them and we'll get the job done, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=504.92s)]
*  we'll completely get rid of Hamas. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=507.8s)]
*  But I think this is also indicative of the fact [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=509.76s)]
*  that there is no stepping back [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=512.12s)]
*  from the possibility of a ground incursion. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=514.4s)]
*  And then we're not seeing anything on the ground [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=516.52s)]
*  at the moment that would indicate that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=518.52s)]
*  We're still hearing heavy detonations [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=520.48s)]
*  coming from within Gaza. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  I've heard military helicopters in the area this morning. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=524.12s)]
*  So what we heard from the Israeli Defense Chief yesterday, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=527.08s)]
*  a general staff, head of general staff, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=532.12s)]
*  saying that they're ready, that the troops are ready, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=535.5600000000001s)]
*  that they're getting additional training. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=538.4000000000001s)]
*  But I think the posture is set for when the command comes [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=540.1600000000001s)]
*  that the troops are ready for that incursion. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=543.84s)]
*  Very clear that they're being paused, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=547.0s)]
*  very clear that that has to do with humanitarian aid, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=549.64s)]
*  has to do with hostages, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=552.72s)]
*  quite the connections we don't see. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=554.2s)]
*  But that force is there, it's ready to go. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't see anyone pulling it back at the moment, Aaron. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=558.36s)]
*  All right, Nick Robertson, thank you very much [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=562.9200000000001s)]
*  along the Gaza border in Sturrode. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=565.08s)]
*  Appreciate that. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=567.72s)]
*  And I wanna go now to the IDF spokesman, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=570.12s)]
*  Colonel, I appreciate your time. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=572.52s)]
*  I'm glad to speak with you this morning. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=573.64s)]
*  I wanna give you first a chance to respond [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=575.12s)]
*  to what we were saying was one of the things [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=577.32s)]
*  that stood out as this hostage has spoken out, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=578.92s)]
*  that Hamas was prepared for this, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=581.24s)]
*  feminine hygiene products, shampoo, antibiotics, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=584.7199999999999s)]
*  and paramedics, medical care, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=590.52s)]
*  eating the same food as the hostages ate. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=594.16s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=596.92s)]
*  Well, clearly, Aaron, they were prepared for the attack. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=601.4799999999999s)]
*  We see just the magnitude of their attacks. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=605.36s)]
*  So they had a very clear plan of action. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=607.56s)]
*  So it shouldn't be any surprise to us [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=609.88s)]
*  that this is what they had underground [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=612.3599999999999s)]
*  as they abducted over 200 people into Gaza. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=614.7199999999999s)]
*  I remind you, they did a coordinated attack [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=621.3599999999999s)]
*  with more than 20 points of breach, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=623.92s)]
*  overground, at ground, and at sea. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=626.0s)]
*  They penetrated some 30 different communities [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=630.4799999999999s)]
*  across southern Israel, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  and butchered and murdered and raped over 1,400 people. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=636.56s)]
*  So why should we be surprised [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=640.84s)]
*  if that was the level of preparation? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=642.6s)]
*  They're also taking care of the preparations required [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=644.88s)]
*  for the people that they intended to abduct. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCgI8OoeZF8&t=648.0s)]
