# Israeli teen opens up about choosing jail over military service
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4)
*  Across Israel protesters are growing louder. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=0.0s)]
*  Those frustrated by the war now grappling with how to make their voices heard. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=3.04s)]
*  CNN's Melissa Bell has more. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  In Israel too, there are those who object to their government's handling of the war [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=12.72s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=18.48s)]
*  Among them, Ben Arad, who as an 18-year-old is due to enlist this week for his mandatory [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=20.0s)]
*  military service. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=25.44s)]
*  Instead, he tells the crowd he's choosing to go to jail. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=27.360000000000003s)]
*  We caught up with him in Tel Aviv on his very last day of freedom. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=34.24s)]
*  I don't refuse because I'm afraid of being hurt or killed in military action. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=38.36s)]
*  I have a very, very deep disgust of the things that I'm seeing happening. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=45.44s)]
*  As he says, that Israeli media doesn't dwell on, but that he seeks out on international [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=52.92s)]
*  networks and online. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  I think something that really broke my heart was the flower massacre. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  So seeing people trample each other to get food, I mean, you just can't deny at that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=66.0s)]
*  point that there is a famine going on and people are hungry. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=76.48s)]
*  So on Monday, Ben will hand himself in, becoming one of only a handful of so-called refuseniks [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=80.36s)]
*  to make their decisions public since the war began. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=85.68s)]
*  In a country where military service marks the start of every Israeli's grown-up life, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=93.4s)]
*  aside from those exempt on religious grounds, the war has made avoiding it a political act. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=97.88s)]
*  I've been called a traitor. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=103.8s)]
*  I've been told that I need to be deported or I've been asked why I don't just move. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=107.36s)]
*  I mean, but it's not such terrible stuff. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=112.56s)]
*  I haven't gotten that yet. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=116.96s)]
*  Like, I'll get that when I go to jail. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=118.12s)]
*  Yet Ben says he's determined to give up his freedom in order to remain free of a war that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=121.32s)]
*  he simply doesn't believe in. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=126.92s)]
*  Now, it's difficult to overstate what a remarkable decision it is for an Israeli 18-year-old [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=128.6s)]
*  to decide not to serve, given the place that military service has in this country, but [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  especially at this time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=143.0s)]
*  I think listening to the testimonies that you were just hearing there, Breonna and Boris, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  that you just heard from that doctor, remember that international networks like CNN can't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=148.44s)]
*  get into Gaza, but do what they can to try and show what's happening to Palestinian civilians, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  that he's had to seek out that information to make his decision, I think is interesting in itself. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=158.20000000000002s)]
*  One media analyst pointing out that here in Israel, the drums of war have been beating [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=162.96s)]
*  so loudly that it's been hard for the Israeli public to get access through its own media [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=167.24s)]
*  to much of what's happening to Palestinian civilians. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  So a remarkable story at a remarkable time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=176.56s)]
*  And bear in mind that we are now in the third day of four days of protest against this war [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=178.76s)]
*  here in Jerusalem. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=183.12s)]
*  Boris and Breonna. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=184.12s)]
*  Yeah, a really fascinating perspective from that young man. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=185.4s)]
*  Melissa Bell, LiveForce in Jerusalem, thank you so much. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=188.16s)]
*  Alright, in terms of what else is happening on the ground in Gaza, what was once the enclave's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=190.56s)]
*  largest hospital, really a place of hope and healing, is now permanently out of service. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=194.24s)]
*  That's according to the acting director of the Al-Shifa Medical Complex. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=200.96s)]
*  Yeah, the hospital has turned into a makeshift graveyard one day after Israeli troops ended [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  their two-week siege there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=208.6s)]
*  The World Health Organization says Al-Shifa is in ruins and can no longer be able to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  function in any way as a hospital. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=215.08s)]
*  Now these before and after images show the extent of the destruction. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=217.44s)]
*  A WHO spokesperson says that the loss of the hospital will have devastating consequences [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=221.08s)]
*  for the people of Gaza. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=226.2s)]
*  We've had contact with the staff. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=227.6s)]
*  The directors told us that Al-Shifa hospital is gone. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=231.8s)]
*  Destroying Al-Shifa means ripping the heart out of the health system. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=235.56s)]
*  It was the tertiary care center. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=238.8s)]
*  It was a huge hospital. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=241.12s)]
*  750 beds, 25 operating theaters, 30 intensive care rooms. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  It was the place people go to for the kind of care that a really good health system provides [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=248.76s)]
*  that we in all our societies expect to have should we be in need. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=256.24s)]
*  Now Israel has described the 14-day raid as an anti-terror mission and a government spokesperson [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=263.0s)]
*  is referring to the operation as the gold standard of urban warfare. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=268.44s)]
*  I believe that the terrorist takeover of Shifa and the subsequent special forces operation [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=274.28s)]
*  to clear the hospital of terrorists will be studied by future generations of military [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  strategists at West Point and Sandhurst as the gold standard for urban warfare. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=286.88s)]
*  Our next guest says the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza has killed more children, more women, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=297.28s)]
*  doctors, aid workers and journalists than any other war in our time. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=302.64s)]
*  Jan Englund is the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=307.15999999999997s)]
*  He joins us live now from Oslo, Norway. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  Jan, I want to start obviously by talking about what happened with the World Central [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=313.32s)]
*  Kitchen aid workers, seven of them rather tragically killed. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=318.08s)]
*  Really it is part of the calculation of aid organizations when you are entering into a [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  war zone that there is some degree of risk. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=328.48s)]
*  But there are also certain things that these organizations often do to mitigate the risks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=332.12s)]
*  They coordinated with the IDF, the IDF knew their coordinates, they were in a vehicle [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=337.04s)]
*  that was clearly marked with World Central Kitchen's logo. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=342.36s)]
*  A lot of people are asking themselves how on earth could this have happened? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=346.0s)]
*  I'm not really sure what else they could have done to really mitigate the risks. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=350.48s)]
*  I just want to start by getting your reaction to what happened. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=353.92s)]
*  I think our colleagues in World Central Kitchen did everything that they could to be safe [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=357.8s)]
*  in a war zone, helping the children and the women and the innocent with food and the Israelis [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=365.44s)]
*  that deliberately targeted these vehicles. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=373.44s)]
*  We do not believe that they wanted to attack World Central Kitchen, with whom they had [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=377.84000000000003s)]
*  worked a lot in previous operations to reach people in Gaza, but they deliberately and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=383.72s)]
*  repeatedly targeted these three vehicles. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=391.48s)]
*  So it's very clear that they are again and again and again targeting without knowing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=395.48s)]
*  who's inside. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=403.16s)]
*  Therefore, it's the worst casualty of any war in recent memory in terms of women, children, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=405.04s)]
*  the innocent, the aid workers, the doctors, the nurses, the teachers, any group that have [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=417.24s)]
*  protection under international law. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=426.84000000000003s)]
*  It's not the gold standard of good warfare. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=428.72s)]
*  This is a race to the bottom, and it's happening with American, German, and other Western [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=433.76s)]
*  arms. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=441.48s)]
*  Jan, in response to this tragic strike, the Israeli Defense Minister said that Israel [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=442.48s)]
*  would open a joint situation room with international groups to enable coordination of aid distribution [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=449.52s)]
*  in Gaza with the military. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=455.56s)]
*  Now, aside from a ceasefire, which of course would require both sides to agree and for [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=458.8s)]
*  Hamas to also release hostages, do you think this is the right next step in terms of rebuilding [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=464.68s)]
*  trust and getting more aid, much more needed aid, into Gaza given the dire situation now? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=471.32s)]
*  And you have the World Central Kitchen understandably saying they're going to suspend their work [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=479.0s)]
*  there following this tragedy. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=483.44s)]
*  They will, and other groups, including my own, have said we will not send convoys north [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=486.96000000000004s)]
*  at this time because they are so often targeted by the Israeli war machine. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=492.68s)]
*  If they now will have a deconfliction system, a notification system with international staff [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  embedded in the Israeli military high command, it would be a step in the right direction. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=508.76000000000005s)]
*  I've been an aid worker in many war zones, and we had a system in Afghanistan with U.S. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  military when the U.S. was there in the Afghan military high command, and that worked pretty [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=522.56s)]
*  well. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=530.52s)]
*  We had even in the 2006 war in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, we had U.N. staff in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=531.52s)]
*  the Israeli high command. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  We haven't had that in the Gaza war, and partly therefore I think there hasn't been a deconfliction [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=540.56s)]
*  system, a notification system that has protected aid workers. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=546.68s)]
*  However, we need really more than anything else, a ceasefire so that this senseless blood [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=551.24s)]
*  shedding can stop. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  And the second thing we need is all of the border crossings, including those in the north [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  that Israel has shut down so that we cannot reach civilians in a safe way. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=569.28s)]
*  We need those border crossings to open. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhzEDGmWJV4&t=574.44s)]
