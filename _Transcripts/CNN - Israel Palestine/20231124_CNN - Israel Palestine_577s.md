# Videos show civilian hostages released by Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA)
*  The breaking news this hour, an outpouring of emotion here in Israel as Hamas releases [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=0.0s)]
*  24 hostages kidnapped back on October 7th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=5.2s)]
*  CNN's Matthew Chance has details, including a closer look at the video Hamas released [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=9.64s)]
*  of the hostage handoff inside Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=15.08s)]
*  They kidnapped and killed, but now Hamas is showing its gunmen releasing Israelis in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=19.6s)]
*  For many, these are disturbing scenes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Seven-year-old Ohad Munder being embraced as he's set free. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=29.72s)]
*  An old woman being carried by a masked man as Palestinians cheer. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=34.48s)]
*  After 49 long days of captivity in Gaza, aid workers from the Red Cross drive them through [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=41.32s)]
*  the border into Egypt and to freedom. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=49.44s)]
*  Egyptian television shows a convoy of vehicles heading to the crossing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Then the hostages, including 10 ties, a Filipino and the 13 Israeli women and children, disembarking [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=58.599999999999994s)]
*  for checks. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=65.88s)]
*  Israeli military posted this grainy video of the moment they all finally re-entered [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=68.16s)]
*  the country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=73.16s)]
*  A step, says the Israeli prime minister, towards bringing all hostages home. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=74.16s)]
*  We have just completed the return of the first of our hostages. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=82.28s)]
*  Children, their mothers and additional women. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  Each one of them is a whole world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=87.88s)]
*  But I emphasize to you, the families, and to you, citizens of Israel, we are committed [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=89.88s)]
*  to return all our hostages. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=94.16s)]
*  Most of the hostages released in this first group under the temporary truce were taken [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=99.2s)]
*  from near Oz, one of the small Israeli communities near Gaza ravaged by Hamas on October 7. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=104.28s)]
*  At least 38 people there were killed and more than 70 abducted. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  People like Danielle Aloni and her five-year-old daughter, Emilia, both freed in this latest [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=120.04s)]
*  release, but the relatives they were visiting when Hamas attacked remain unaccounted for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=125.84s)]
*  as hostages. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=132.04s)]
*  Behind every release, a poignant reminder of those left behind. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=134.0s)]
*  Take the family of Omri Almog. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=139.44s)]
*  His brother-in-law and niece killed, his sister and her three children still hostages. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=142.04s)]
*  Yet Omri is now optimistic. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=147.84s)]
*  The best is in front of us. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=150.68s)]
*  It's going to come. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=152.84s)]
*  Whatever happens, we cannot change. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=154.32s)]
*  Nadav is no longer with us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=156.6s)]
*  Siam, the beautiful girl, is not with us anymore. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=158.88s)]
*  But there's still a chance. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=163.8s)]
*  There's still a chance for your sister and her children. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=165.12s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=167.32s)]
*  We have to bring what left. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=168.32s)]
*  We need to bring back what left from this family. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=169.68s)]
*  It's a broken family. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  A broken family in a country of shattered lives. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=173.76s)]
*  Matthew Chance is joining me live here in Tel Aviv right now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=180.76s)]
*  So, first of all, Matthew, what do we know about what is expected to happen tomorrow? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=183.72s)]
*  Well, we think, Wolf, that it's going to follow a similar kind of course already. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=187.56s)]
*  The Israeli officials that we've spoken to said that Mossad and the Israeli military [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=193.44s)]
*  have received a list of potential hostage releases from Hamas via the mediators in Qatar. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=196.84s)]
*  They haven't told us who's on the list. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=203.84s)]
*  Of course, we don't even know how many names are on that list. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=205.28s)]
*  It's going to be between 10 and 13, like it was today. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=207.6s)]
*  But Israeli officials say that they've already informed the families involved so they can [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  be prepared to welcome back their loved ones. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  I think you have to remember that the events of today, the pause in the fighting, the releases [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  of the hostages and the prisons from Israeli jails, as well as the humanitarian relief, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=224.28s)]
*  it went remarkably well. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  I think the hope is that that can be repeated again and again. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  Let's hope it does get repeated and these hostages are able to come home. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=235.6s)]
*  Matthew, thank you very much. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=239.0s)]
*  Matthew Chance reporting. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  I want to go to CNN's Oren Lieberman right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  He's over at the Wolfson Medical Center here in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  Oren, I know you're at this hospital where hostages have arrived. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  Update our viewers. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=251.6s)]
*  What do we actually see? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=252.6s)]
*  Well, Wolf, this is one of several hospitals that have taken in the freed hostages over [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=256.6s)]
*  the course of the past several hours. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=261.4s)]
*  At about 9 o'clock tonight, two patients, two of the first freed hostages arrived by [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=263.12s)]
*  ambulance. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=267.76s)]
*  A couple of hours after that, take a look at this video. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=268.76s)]
*  This is three more elderly women hostages being brought in on helicopter. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=271.36s)]
*  There actually is no helipad here at the hospital itself, so they landed at a field nearby and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=276.04s)]
*  were brought in on ambulance. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  Take a look at this video of the hostages being loaded onto the ambulances. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=283.72s)]
*  The cheers, the unbridled joy, the happiness as they were loaded here in Israel and brought [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=287.6s)]
*  to the hospital for care. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=293.64s)]
*  It is that same joy that played out in the hospital itself, according to the staff here, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=296.12s)]
*  when they were brought in, when they were welcomed, and when they began to receive the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=300.76s)]
*  professional medical care of Wolfson Medical Center. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=304.12s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=307.0s)]
*  I think that there was no one in the room that could hold his feelings and stop crying [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=309.36s)]
*  because it was a very emotional and exciting event. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  They met their families and they met a very professional team here that was very good [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=321.48s)]
*  prepared to receive those hostages. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=329.28s)]
*  Now the hospital wouldn't say all that much about their condition, their well-being, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  or their mental state. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=340.76s)]
*  They said they're going to respect the privacy of the five hostages that are here. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=341.76s)]
*  They have set up a special wing of the hospital just for them and their families as they go [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=345.72s)]
*  through all of the checks, all of the medical evaluations. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=350.76s)]
*  And it's not just a question of their physical health, it's also a question of their mental [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=354.16s)]
*  health right now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=358.0s)]
*  Psychologists brought in as well as other professionals to essentially give them any [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=359.0s)]
*  type of help they might need. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=363.08000000000004s)]
*  The critical first step was reuniting them with their family. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  That happened here several hours ago. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  And crucially, it's not a one-time deal here. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=370.32s)]
*  This isn't a process that began and ended the hospital well aware that there might be [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=373.28000000000003s)]
*  more elderly freed hostages coming out of Gaza over the course of the next several days. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  And they say they are very much ready to receive them as well with the same sort of open arms [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  to begin that recovery process. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  Oren, Wolfson is not the only Israeli hospital where hostages were taken today. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=390.04s)]
*  How is that working? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=395.92s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  Wolfson will focus on the elderly, the five freed hostages who were brought here were [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  elderly women. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  But there are other hospitals that will focus on different populations or groups. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=406.04s)]
*  So Schneider Medical Center, which is in Pettah Tikva, not all that far from us, that will [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=410.12s)]
*  focus on the children who are freed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=414.66s)]
*  And they have set up essentially a special area to try to make it feel as little as possible [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=417.1s)]
*  like a hospital. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=422.38000000000005s)]
*  They want it to feel almost like a luxury hotel to make them as comfortable as possible. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=423.38000000000005s)]
*  Wolf, another example, Asafa Rofe, that is set up to receive the foreign nationals and [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=427.22s)]
*  that's part of the system here in place for the freeing of the hostages. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=431.46000000000004s)]
*  Oren Lieberman reporting from Tel Aviv. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=437.06s)]
*  Oren, thank you very much. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=438.90000000000003s)]
*  President Biden says he hopes and expects American hostages will be freed very soon, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=441.46s)]
*  even though none were released on this the first day of the truce. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=446.62s)]
*  CNN's Arlette Sines is traveling with the president in Nantucket, Massachusetts for us right now. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=450.98s)]
*  Arlette, how is the president feeling about this deal so far? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=456.06s)]
*  Well, President Biden welcomed the initial release that occurred of these hostages being [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=462.06s)]
*  held by Hamas earlier today. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=466.66s)]
*  He said that this was just a start to the process, but said that he believes that this [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=468.54s)]
*  had unfolded well. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=472.66s)]
*  But it does come as Americans were not included in that initial batch of hostages that were [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=474.58s)]
*  released. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=480.42s)]
*  So the president said that it is his hope and expectation that there will be three Americans [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=481.42s)]
*  coming out in the coming days. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=485.58000000000004s)]
*  That includes two women and also four-year-old Abigail Adon. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=487.1s)]
*  It was her birthday on Friday. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=491.42s)]
*  Her parents were killed in the October 7th attack by Hamas. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=493.46000000000004s)]
*  She has been held hostage over the course of the past seven weeks. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=497.3s)]
*  But President Biden had very few details to offer as relating to his expectation on when [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=500.90000000000003s)]
*  exactly these Americans would be getting out. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=507.06s)]
*  Take a listen to what he had to tell reporters earlier today. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=509.74s)]
*  We don't know when that will occur, but we're going to be expected to occur. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=513.58s)]
*  And we don't know what the list of all the hostages are and when they'll be released, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=517.94s)]
*  but we know the numbers are going to be released. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=522.58s)]
*  So it's my hope and expectation will be soon. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=525.26s)]
*  And of the 10 Americans that are unaccounted for, do you know all of their conditions? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=527.4599999999999s)]
*  Are they all alive? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=531.86s)]
*  We don't know all of their conditions. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=532.86s)]
*  So still a number of unanswered questions about the fate of these American hostages [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=537.06s)]
*  being held by Hamas. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=540.9399999999999s)]
*  But President Biden today also expressed some optimism that there this fight, this pause [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=542.3s)]
*  in the fighting that's currently slated for four days, he believes that that could possibly [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=548.02s)]
*  be extended to get even more than the 50 women and children that had been negotiated in this [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=552.86s)]
*  initial deal. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNPh803AUEA&t=558.1800000000001s)]
