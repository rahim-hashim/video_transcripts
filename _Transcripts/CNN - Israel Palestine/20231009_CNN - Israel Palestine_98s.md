# How Israel's Iron Dome Works
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE)
*  The only thing that we're aware of that can compromise the Iron Dome is a lack of ammunition. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=0.0s)]
*  And there's no indication that it has a lack of ammunition at the moment. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=6.4s)]
*  Generally, the stocks are high in anticipation of events like this. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=10.4s)]
*  The United States supplies more ammunition as required for Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=14.56s)]
*  I think it goes without saying at the moment that those flows of ammunition will be ready, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=18.88s)]
*  will be coming. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  That's the commitment we heard from President Biden. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  The way the system works, the system works across the country. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=27.56s)]
*  The Iron Dome's, wherever they are on the ground, like the one we saw firing out there, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=31.92s)]
*  are interlocked with other Iron Dome firing systems throughout the country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=36.56s)]
*  When missiles are fired from Gaza, the system reads, detects where the missiles are precisely [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=40.96s)]
*  coming from and where they're calculated to be going. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=47.44s)]
*  The nearest and best available Iron Dome system fires off to intercept those Hamas rockets [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=51.36s)]
*  as they come into Israeli territory. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=58.24s)]
*  That's what we're witnessing right now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=60.56s)]
*  This is the defensive missile system taking off. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=62.44s)]
*  The sirens were going off around here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  And you can see, I can see black smoke rising just to the left of the Iron Dome. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=68.68s)]
*  That's new black smoke. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=73.6s)]
*  Black smoke often indicates an impact. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=75.36s)]
*  We don't know that right now. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=77.44s)]
*  But we have seen at least several dozen of these interceptor rockets, the Iron Dome, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=79.16s)]
*  taking off here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=84.36s)]
*  The sirens have gone off. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=85.72s)]
*  I'm looking down the highway. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=87.0s)]
*  The traffic stopped here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=88.2s)]
*  Everyone is getting out of their vehicles to find a safe space to hide. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=89.48s)]
*  And you're hearing the booms there of the intercepts that are happening. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrEMJNj35VE&t=93.48s)]
