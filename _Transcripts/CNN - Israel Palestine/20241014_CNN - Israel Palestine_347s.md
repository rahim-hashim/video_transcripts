# Parents whose son was killed by Hamas describe the conditions of his captivity
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM)
*  Just before the break, we shared part of my conversation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=0.0s)]
*  with Hirsch Goldberg-Polin's parents [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=2.5s)]
*  about the grief they've been experiencing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=4.32s)]
*  since learning that Hirsch was murdered in a tunnel in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=5.98s)]
*  Here's more of our interview. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=9.22s)]
*  John, have you learned more about Hirsch's time [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=11.34s)]
*  as a hostage? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  We have. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=19.78s)]
*  So what we've learned is at least [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  towards the end of his captivity, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  and we don't know for exactly how long, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=26.94s)]
*  Hirsch and five others, Alex, Ori, Almog, Carmel, and Eden, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=29.62s)]
*  were held in a tunnel 65 feet underground, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=36.38s)]
*  a tunnel that was just over two feet wide [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=40.5s)]
*  and five and a half feet tall. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  Hirsch is six feet tall, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=45.7s)]
*  so he and most of the others could not stand in this tunnel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=47.22s)]
*  There was hardly any air, no light, no plumbing, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=51.86s)]
*  no real floor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  I mean, it was a dirt tunnel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=57.62s)]
*  The six bodies were found in a tunnel [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=60.5s)]
*  that had six narrow mattresses [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=62.58s)]
*  that we can only assume that when they were able [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=64.58s)]
*  to get any sleep, they would line them up head to toe [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=66.66s)]
*  because that's the only way they could possibly fit. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=69.74s)]
*  And we know the conditions in which these bodies were found. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=74.1s)]
*  The bodies were found on Saturday, August 31st. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=81.46s)]
*  The belief is that they were killed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=84.94s)]
*  roughly two days earlier on Thursday, August 29th. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=86.7s)]
*  All of them had multiple gunshot wounds [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=92.98s)]
*  and all had suffered severe weight loss. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  Hirsch, who, as I said, was just about six feet tall, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=98.7s)]
*  came out at 115 pounds. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=102.02000000000001s)]
*  Eden, a five foot five woman, 24 years old, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=105.14s)]
*  came out at 79 pounds. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=108.18s)]
*  And on and on and on, similar stories across all of them. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=111.22s)]
*  We also know that in the tunnel, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=114.54s)]
*  they were surrounded by bottles of urine [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=118.22000000000001s)]
*  that when they had to go to the bathroom, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=123.04s)]
*  they would go in these bottles. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=125.14s)]
*  And so there were many, many bottles of very dark urine [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=127.5s)]
*  showing how dehydrated they were. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=131.22s)]
*  We know that they were starving [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=134.34s)]
*  because they were all completely emaciated. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=136.46s)]
*  At the, toward one end of the tunnel, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=139.38s)]
*  they had put a plastic bucket for, you know, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=142.22s)]
*  some sort of privacy when they had to use the bathroom, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=146.3s)]
*  not for urine. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=149.22s)]
*  The conditions are horrifying. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=152.02s)]
*  And that is so much of, you know, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=155.26s)]
*  John was describing some of the, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  what we know about what happened to Hirsch, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=165.74s)]
*  but we have spoken extensively to forensic experts [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=168.26s)]
*  who've sort of dissected for us the report [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  of what happened specifically to Hirsch. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=177.12s)]
*  And it looks that, you know, his left hand had been, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  had been missing since he was abducted [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=184.85999999999999s)]
*  on October 7th last year. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=189.0s)]
*  But it seems that when he was being shot, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=190.57999999999998s)]
*  that he had sort of put up as a defense, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=193.29999999999998s)]
*  his both arms. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=196.6s)]
*  So a bullet went through his right hand, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=199.96s)]
*  through his shoulder actually, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=203.28s)]
*  then into his neck and then out of the side of his head. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=206.0s)]
*  It looks that then he would, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=210.32s)]
*  and supposedly he was standing crouched over, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=212.08s)]
*  because of course he couldn't stand up straight [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=215.0s)]
*  because he was too tall to stand in the five foot five tunnel. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=216.72s)]
*  They think that then he dropped to his knees [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=220.16s)]
*  and then he was shot with the gun on his head, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=222.76s)]
*  the back of his head, which exited the top of his head. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=226.92s)]
*  And he was found on his knees two days later. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=231.72s)]
*  And Eden Yerushalmi was resting, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  her head was resting kind of on his side or on his lap. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=240.28s)]
*  And she had also been shot multiple times [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=245.73999999999998s)]
*  as had all four others. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  Rachel and Johnna, is there anything else you want to say [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=251.28s)]
*  or you want people to know? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=254.12s)]
*  I mean, I think we just finished, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=259.56s)]
*  we're in the part of the Jewish calendar [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=261.78s)]
*  where we just finished very somber, serious. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=264.12s)]
*  Rosh Hashanah is judgment day. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=268.84s)]
*  And then we have a 10 day period [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=272.44s)]
*  between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=274.12s)]
*  which is the day of atonement, which was just on Saturday. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=276.6s)]
*  And we have a very big idea of how does one repent [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=280.84s)]
*  when someone feels that they have done something [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  not hitting the mark correctly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  And the way that you do that in Judaism [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  is when you find yourself in that same situation next time, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=299.44s)]
*  do you choose to do differently? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=303.62s)]
*  And we've had so many people say to us [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=306.08s)]
*  that they are so sorry and they feel so bad [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=309.84s)]
*  about what happened to Hirsch [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=313.28s)]
*  and these other five beautiful young people. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=314.84s)]
*  And we have said to everyone, don't be sorry, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=317.84s)]
*  go save the 101. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=322.64s)]
*  And so as people from all over the world, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=325.64s)]
*  people of power and influence from all different countries, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=329.52s)]
*  people in the negotiating room, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=332.88s)]
*  people adjacent to the negotiating room, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=334.52s)]
*  I would just beseech you, go and get these people. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=336.76s)]
*  Rachel Goldberg and John Pullen, thank you. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=343.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=345.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Anderson. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflH4pZz9BM&t=346.56s)]
