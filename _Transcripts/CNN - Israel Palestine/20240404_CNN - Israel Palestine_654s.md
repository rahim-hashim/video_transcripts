# Biden to Netanyahu: Protect civilians or else
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds)
*  We need to go to Secretary of State Blinken. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=0.0s)]
*  He is in Brussels. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=2.2s)]
*  Let's listen in and we'll come back to that. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=3.16s)]
*  And I made clear then the commitment of the United [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  States to Israel's security and to ensuring that October 7th [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=9.72s)]
*  could never happen again. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=16.0s)]
*  I also underscored Israel's moral, strategic, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=19.12s)]
*  and legal requirements to protect civilians [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=24.12s)]
*  and provide humanitarian assistance to those who needed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=28.8s)]
*  it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=31.64s)]
*  Now, of course, what happened after October 7th [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=33.64s)]
*  could have ended immediately if Hamas had stopped [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=38.44s)]
*  hiding behind civilians, released the hostages, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=42.96s)]
*  and put down its weapons. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=46.96s)]
*  But Israel is not Hamas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=50.64s)]
*  Israel is a democracy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=54.68s)]
*  Hamas, a terrorist organization. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=56.76s)]
*  And democracies place the highest value on human life, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=59.76s)]
*  every human life. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=63.44s)]
*  As has been said, whoever saves a life saves the entire world. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=66.8s)]
*  That's our strength. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=73.64s)]
*  It's what distinguishes us from terrorists like Hamas. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=75.6s)]
*  If we lose that reverence for human life, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=81.36s)]
*  we risk becoming indistinguishable [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=85.52s)]
*  from those we confront. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=87.92s)]
*  Here's the current reality in Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=90.92s)]
*  Despite important steps that Israel's taken [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=94.16s)]
*  to allow assistance into Gaza, the results on the ground [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=96.6s)]
*  are woefully insufficient and unacceptable. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  100% of the population in Gaza knows acute levels [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=106.75999999999999s)]
*  of food insecurity. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=111.0s)]
*  100% of the population is in need [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=112.76s)]
*  of humanitarian assistance. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=115.72s)]
*  And those working heroically to provide that assistance [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  are doing so in great peril to their own lives. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=122.64s)]
*  This week's horrific attack on the World Central Kitchen [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  was not the first such incident. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  It must be the last. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=135.4s)]
*  President Biden spoke a short while ago [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=138.84s)]
*  with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=140.44s)]
*  The leaders discussed the situation in Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=143.04s)]
*  The president emphasized that the strikes [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=146.64s)]
*  on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=148.56s)]
*  are unacceptable. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=153.12s)]
*  He made clear the need for Israel [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=155.12s)]
*  to announce a series of specific, concrete, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=157.24s)]
*  and measurable steps to address civilian harm, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=161.84s)]
*  humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=164.72s)]
*  He made clear that US policy with respect to Gaza [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=169.76s)]
*  will be determined by our assessment of Israel's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=173.44s)]
*  immediate action on these steps. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=175.92s)]
*  He underscored as well that an immediate ceasefire [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=179.39999999999998s)]
*  is essential to stabilize and improve [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=181.6s)]
*  the humanitarian situation and protect innocent civilians. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=184.0s)]
*  And he urged Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  to empower his negotiators to conclude a deal without delay [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=188.56s)]
*  to bring the hostages home. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=192.16s)]
*  The two leaders also discussed public Iranian threats [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  against Israel and the Israeli people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=198.04s)]
*  President Biden reaffirmed the United States' [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  strong support for Israel in the face of these threats [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=203.0s)]
*  and our commitment to Israel's security. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=206.72s)]
*  Right now, there is no higher priority in Gaza [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  than protecting civilians, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=214.48s)]
*  surging humanitarian assistance, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=216.6s)]
*  and ensuring the security of those who provide it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=218.84s)]
*  Israel must meet this moment. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=223.28s)]
*  We've been listening to the Secretary of State [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  Antony Blinken at NATO headquarters [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=228.04s)]
*  on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the organization. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  He's live in Brussels, Belgium. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  Some significant remarks [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=235.72s)]
*  when it comes to the conflict in Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  The Secretary of State saying that he has communicated [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=239.48s)]
*  to Israeli officials not only the US's commitment to Israel [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  and its war against Hamas, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  but also the moral obligation that Israel has [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  to protect civilians and aid workers in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=250.83999999999997s)]
*  He specifically said, and I quote, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=254.48s)]
*  if we lose reverence for human life, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=256.28s)]
*  we become indistinguishable from them, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=258.84s)]
*  from Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=261.64s)]
*  He described the efforts so far by Israel since October 7th [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=263.52s)]
*  to protect civilians and humanitarian aid workers [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=267.44s)]
*  as woefully inadequate. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=270.24s)]
*  And he laid out what we just got a readout from the call [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=272.28s)]
*  that President Biden had with the Prime Minister, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=275.0s)]
*  that the United States would consider its approach to Israel [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=277.6s)]
*  based on concrete steps to change the way [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  that Israel's handled civilians and aid workers. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=288.04s)]
*  They're expecting data from Israel, which is clear. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=288.88s)]
*  He said that they need to have concrete measurable steps [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=290.8s)]
*  to address harm to civilians, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  civilian suffering, and also to aid workers. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  And he said that US aid to Gaza [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=300.72s)]
*  may be determined by those steps. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=304.16s)]
*  That's essentially what he said. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=306.48s)]
*  And this is really significant because it comes on the heel [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  of a very close Biden ally, Senator Coons, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  talking this morning about being open [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=314.32s)]
*  to putting conditions on aid to Israel, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=316.04s)]
*  which is really the first time [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=317.76s)]
*  that we have heard the administration go so far. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=319.8s)]
*  And this is even as we're hearing [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  from a senior administration official [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=324.04s)]
*  that the policy hasn't changed, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  that the president is frustrated [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  that the policy hasn't changed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=329.16s)]
*  This is signaling a potential policy change. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=330.68s)]
*  So nonetheless, this is big. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=334.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=336.0s)]
*  Notably, the timing of the apparent accidental strike [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=337.0s)]
*  coming almost a day after the US announced [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=340.88s)]
*  this enormous deal, $18 billion [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=343.64s)]
*  to sell F-15 fighter jets to Israel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=346.52s)]
*  The question now being, is this rhetoric [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=349.32s)]
*  that actually moves the needle, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=351.84s)]
*  or do there have to be conditions on arms [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=353.12s)]
*  in order to get Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=355.79999999999995s)]
*  and some of the other Israeli officials [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=358.32s)]
*  to carry out significant change [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=360.12s)]
*  in the way that they've been conducting the war? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  We have with us retired Colonel Cedric Leighton [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  to give us some perspective. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  Colonel Leighton, from what you heard [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=369.04s)]
*  from the Secretary of State there, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=370.24s)]
*  it is a noticeable shift saying that the policy [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=372.48s)]
*  toward Israel will change, determined on the way [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  that Israel conducts its operations in Gaza. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=381.36s)]
*  Absolutely, and in essence, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  what we're talking about, Boris, here is conditioning [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=384.76000000000005s)]
*  the aid on Israeli conduct going forward. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  And I guess in this case, you can kind of say [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  the past is prologue because the past conduct [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=392.24s)]
*  of Israeli operations has not met US standards. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=395.52s)]
*  And at this point in time, it appears as if, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  it appears as if the Department of Defense [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=401.12s)]
*  and the administration are looking at changing [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=403.44s)]
*  the policy potentially, where they actually say, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=405.76s)]
*  look, you cannot use these weapons against civilian targets. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=408.68s)]
*  You cannot use these weapons against aid workers. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=412.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's the kind of thing [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=415.44s)]
*  that I think might be happening here. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=416.91999999999996s)]
*  Whether or not it does, of course, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=419.0s)]
*  is going to be borne out in the next few days, probably. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=420.88s)]
*  But you mentioned the F-15 sale to Israel. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=424.48s)]
*  That's something that's gonna take place [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  over the next four or five years [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=429.36s)]
*  in order to actually get those weapons to the Israelis. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  But the other part of this is they have already delivered [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=433.56s)]
*  in the process of delivering more 2,000 pound bombs [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=437.0s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=440.12s)]
*  That's a much more immediate thing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see whether or not [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  that delivery is stopped before they actually are put [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=444.08000000000004s)]
*  into Israeli airplanes for potential use. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=449.12s)]
*  And that's going to be a significant thing. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  There are two things that the Israelis, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=454.68s)]
*  that the US is worried about with Israel. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=456.71999999999997s)]
*  One of them is the immediate conduct in Gaza. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=458.56s)]
*  The second thing is using Israel as a buffer against Iran. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=460.96s)]
*  And that is going to be kind of the balancing act [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=464.52s)]
*  that the administration has to deal with at this point. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=467.68s)]
*  Let's listen in to Admiral Kirby. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=469.96s)]
*  And the overall humanitarian situation [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=472.0s)]
*  in Gaza are unacceptable. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=473.96s)]
*  He made clear the need for Israel to announce [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=476.68s)]
*  and to implement a series of specific, concrete, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=479.64000000000004s)]
*  and measurable steps to address civilian harm, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=482.20000000000005s)]
*  humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=485.6s)]
*  He made clear that US policy with respect to Gaza [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=489.6s)]
*  will be determined by our assessment [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=492.88000000000005s)]
*  of Israel's immediate action on these steps. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=495.44000000000005s)]
*  He underscored that an immediate ceasefire is essential [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=499.16s)]
*  to stabilize and improve the humanitarian situation [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=501.68s)]
*  and to protect innocent civilians. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=505.08000000000004s)]
*  And he urged the Prime Minister to empower his negotiators [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=506.92s)]
*  to conclude a deal without delay to bring the hostages home. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=509.68s)]
*  The two leaders also discussed public Iranian threats [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=513.52s)]
*  against Israel and the Israeli people. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=515.88s)]
*  President Biden made clear that the United States [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=518.36s)]
*  strongly supports Israel in the face of those threats. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=521.16s)]
*  That's all I have. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=524.08s)]
*  Admiral, you're not specifying what concrete steps [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=525.04s)]
*  Israel must take, exactly? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=528.8000000000001s)]
*  I gave you some, a broad sense of it. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=530.88s)]
*  We want to see more crossings opened up. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=533.92s)]
*  We want to see more trucks getting in, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=535.96s)]
*  particularly from Jordan. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=537.4s)]
*  We want to see tangible steps at the mitigation [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=539.52s)]
*  of civilian harm, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=543.52s)]
*  particularly to humanitarian aid workers, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=545.28s)]
*  but obviously all civilians. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=547.84s)]
*  But we want to see that they have moved forward [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=549.04s)]
*  on proper steps to de-conflict with aid workers [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=552.6s)]
*  as they move around, that the information flow is viable. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=556.6s)]
*  Sure, but that's language we've heard for weeks now. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=560.92s)]
*  You're not talking about sort of telling us [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=563.96s)]
*  how exactly you will measure those measurable steps, right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=566.72s)]
*  What I said was, we're going to examine our policy approaches [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=573.08s)]
*  based on our assessment of the way the Israeli side [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=580.28s)]
*  modifies their behavior, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=586.68s)]
*  modifies their policy and decision-making processes. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  And so, first of all, let's see what they say they're going to do. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=593.28s)]
*  And then let's watch and see how they execute to what they say. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of them on what they plan to say [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=601.0s)]
*  about the changes they're going to make, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=605.04s)]
*  but we'll base our policy decisions based on an assessment [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=606.8399999999999s)]
*  of how they execute to their policy decisions. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=610.28s)]
*  And you're not talking about what potential U.S. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=612.68s)]
*  policy changes are on the table. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=615.64s)]
*  Can you say whether the President shared that [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=617.64s)]
*  with the Prime Minister on this phone call? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=620.3199999999999s)]
*  The President made clear that absent changes [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=622.28s)]
*  in the protection of civilians on the ground, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=626.92s)]
*  absent changes to the volume of humanitarian assistance getting in, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=628.7199999999999s)]
*  absent any movement on a ceasefire [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=633.2399999999999s)]
*  that will allow hostages to get out and more aid to get in, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=641.96s)]
*  absent a calming down, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=646.12s)]
*  that he will have to reconsider his own policy choices [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=648.96s)]
*  with respect to Gaza. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MB9VKx-ds&t=652.44s)]
