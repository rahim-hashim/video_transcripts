# Hear Israeli president's apology to family of killed hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin at his funeral
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4)
*  At the White House, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will hold a critical meeting with the U.S. hostage negotiating team in hopes of crafting a ceasefire deal to free the people Hamas took captive during the October 7th terror attack on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=0.0s)]
*  Ninety seven hostages are still being held, including seven Americans of those Americans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=13.8s)]
*  Four are believed to still be alive. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  This weekend's discovery of six hostages killed in a Hamas tunnel underscores the sense of urgency. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=21.36s)]
*  The Israeli President calls it, quote, cold-blooded murder. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=26.96s)]
*  Minutes ago, a funeral began for the young man on your far left, Israeli-American Hirsch Goldberg-Polin. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=30.28s)]
*  Israel's president apologized to the family in his eulogy. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=36.6s)]
*  As a human being, as a father and as the president of the state of Israel, I want to say how sorry I am. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=42.32s)]
*  I'm sorry I am that we didn't protect Hirsch on that dark day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=49.84s)]
*  How sorry I am that we failed to bring him home. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=55.6s)]
*  In his life and in his death, Hirsch has touched all of humanity deeply. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  He has changed our world and woven his essence of light and love into the story of the Jewish people and into our human story forever. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=66.2s)]
*  This morning, I saw a clip of a vigil that took place in New York last night. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=77.4s)]
*  How appropriate that the crowd was singing, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  A'ni ve'ata nishane et ha'olam. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=85.84s)]
*  You and I will change the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=89.28s)]
*  The 23 years of life that we had with you were a blessing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=92.68s)]
*  We now will work to make your legacy a similar blessing. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=100.12s)]
*  You were a really great guy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=106.36s)]
*  I love you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=109.08s)]
*  For the families of the hostages, it has been nearly 11 months of torment and agonizing disappointment. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=109.76s)]
*  I want to bring in the parents of 20 year old Eden Alexander. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  He is an American member of the Israeli Defense Forces and has been held hostage since the Hamas terror attack on October 7th. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  Adi and Yael Alexander joins us now from New York. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=127.2s)]
*  How is the family holding up? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  Yael, I'll go to you first and your response to what's taking place in Israel right now. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=134.4s)]
*  Hi, good morning, Jim. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=141.24s)]
*  What happened in Israel now that everybody at the streets, there was a strike today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=143.60000000000002s)]
*  Everyone was just screaming and being with the family and just to make sure that they're going to seal the deal. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  They are going to bring our loved ones home. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=158.88s)]
*  Safety, right? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=162.24s)]
*  They're doing whatever they can just to make a noise. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=165.76s)]
*  It's not a political issue. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=168.8s)]
*  It's humanitarian issue. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=170.4s)]
*  And to see all the crowds on the streets, we are not alone. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=172.8s)]
*  You know, we are fighting this fight for 332 days. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=179.56s)]
*  It's almost 11 months that our son is not with us, is not with the family. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=183.64s)]
*  And we are going to do everything in our power to make it happen and to bring him home and to bring the other hostages home. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=189.64s)]
*  Well, I just want to say you are definitely not alone. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=199.32s)]
*  We're all thinking about you. We're all praying for their safe return. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=201.6s)]
*  I do want to play a little bit of what President Biden said just a few moments ago about all of this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=210.88s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think it's time for Prime Minister Netanyahu to do more on this issue? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=212.88s)]
*  Do you think he's doing enough? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=218.68s)]
*  No. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=220.44s)]
*  So you hear the president there saying he doesn't think the prime minister is doing enough. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  What is your thought on that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=225.64s)]
*  I think he's absolutely right. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  From the get go, the U.S. government, we in touch with the U.S. government. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=230.64s)]
*  As you know, we met Jake Sullivan yesterday for 15 times. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  And we don't see the same sense of urgency and the same dedication from the Israelis as we see from the Americans. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=239.88s)]
*  And this is devastating. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=248.08s)]
*  And it's actually very surprising. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  Do you think what work could be done? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=254.6s)]
*  First of all, Netanyahu's government, they have to stop to move the goalpost of the negotiation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=260.28s)]
*  They have to stop to undermine the negotiating team itself. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=271.32s)]
*  And they have to seal the deal. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=275.84s)]
*  Enough is enough. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  Exactly. They need to bring the hostages back home. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=279.32s)]
*  That's it. It's 11 months. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=283.0s)]
*  We don't have time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  Like we saw on Saturday, what happened. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=287.15999999999997s)]
*  They murdered them over there. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=289.2s)]
*  So they need to understand. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=291.12s)]
*  That's why we urge them since the beginning that it's. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  They don't have time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=298.8s)]
*  They live in hell. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=300.52s)]
*  And when you say that Netanyahu keeps moving the goalpost, what do you mean by that? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=302.64s)]
*  I mean by that, that to ramp up additional demand and the Philadelphia crossing as a sticking point of the negotiations, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=308.84s)]
*  this is unacceptable. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  They put a proposal back in May, end of May. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=325.79999999999995s)]
*  Just stick to this proposal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=329.35999999999996s)]
*  They need to move on and to show us that they want the hostages back. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=331.4s)]
*  Now, I like. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=335.36s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if it's going to happen. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. And I do want to share some of the essay that you both wrote for The New York Times. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=341.96s)]
*  We can show this to our viewers. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not just the fear of losing our son that now keeps us up at night. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  It's the fact that his murder is becoming the more probable outcome. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  And we have no faith in Mr. Netanyahu's will to change that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=355.88s)]
*  As a parent, reading that just breaks my heart. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=360.48s)]
*  How do you find the hope that Eden is still alive? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=364.52s)]
*  First, we have some eyewitnesses that were released back in November that he's alive. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  So we're just sticking to this hope that he's a strong kid. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=380.24s)]
*  He was a professional swimmer in high school. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  He's like. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=389.16s)]
*  We hope he's a good like he's amazing, he done. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=391.48s)]
*  And I'm hoping that he's strong and he knows that we are fighting for him and he's will come back home. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=395.48s)]
*  And we're looking at some pictures of it on now, and he just looks like a remarkable young man. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=403.44000000000005s)]
*  Tell us a little bit more about him. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=409.04s)]
*  Ah, he done. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=413.12s)]
*  He done. I don't know. He's got this beautiful smile. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=416.32s)]
*  He love like to be with friends. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=419.52000000000004s)]
*  He love to party. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=422.12s)]
*  He love to be at the beach. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=423.56s)]
*  He love to go to restaurants like this is he done. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=426.0s)]
*  You know, when we've been here in New York, we went to our shows like whatever we can to to live life like this is he done for us. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=429.92s)]
*  And I'm hoping it's going to happen soon. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  Like we can reunite the whole family and we will continue. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=442.48s)]
*  And what has it been like being a part of this community now, I suppose, of other families who are in the same situation? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=448.04s)]
*  How do you support one another, lean on one another to get try to get through this? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=456.76s)]
*  Yeah, we are all big family. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=462.44s)]
*  And with the loss of here on Saturday, we are devastating. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=464.84s)]
*  We were crying. We are broken. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=470.92s)]
*  We are. You know, we. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=473.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is really tough. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=478.44s)]
*  This is really, really tough. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=479.76s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you have to have hope in all of this. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=484.12s)]
*  Absolutely. The hope this is what holding us up. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  Hope is mandatory. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=494.64s)]
*  Hope is mandatory, like Rachel said, and. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  That's it. We don't have a choice. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=502.48s)]
*  We are going to continue fighting till they all come back. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=504.32s)]
*  And what would be your message to Prime Minister Netanyahu? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=509.56s)]
*  You've been very critical of him. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  What would be your message if you could say something, if he were watching, if his team was watching, what would you say? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=518.48s)]
*  He promised us something on the White House in front of Biden and Sullivan last July. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  You want to tell that he will proceed the deal, but our message do not delay it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  You do not delay the deal. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=538.52s)]
*  Military more military pressure brings more dead hostages. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=541.24s)]
*  Let's execute the deal and cross the finish line. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=546.28s)]
*  All right, well, Yael and Adi Alexander, parents of Yidan, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=550.52s)]
*  As I said earlier, we're all thinking about you and your family and all of the families and praying for the safe return of those hostages. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=557.04s)]
*  Thank you so much. We really appreciate it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=563.6s)]
*  Thank you for having us. Thank you. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=565.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOU0UAsJvE4&t=567.0s)]
