**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g)
*  Well, as we've been doing every night on Outfront, we have another exclusive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=0.0s)]
*  dispatch from the journalist Ibrahim Dahman. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=3.12s)]
*  He is inside Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=5.32s)]
*  Ibrahim and his family, as you know, moved from the north to the south, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=7.08s)]
*  and they were hopeful that they would finally be able to escape through Egypt. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=9.68s)]
*  Those hopes for now still hopes not yet successful. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=13.72s)]
*  Ibrahim and his wife, Rasha, and their two young sons, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=18.64s)]
*  age 11 and seven, evacuated northern Gaza when Israel told civilians to leave. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=21.32s)]
*  They complied. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=25.68s)]
*  They fled to the south and now they wait and wait. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=27.599999999999998s)]
*  Here's the update that Ibrahim shared with us today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=31.36s)]
*  We only eat what's left of our lives. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=57.56s)]
*  We spend our time watching the weather. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  And trying to fill the water tank. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=69.76s)]
*  We drink from the water of the toilets, I swear. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=72.88s)]
*  Our sons drink from the water of the toilets. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=76.12s)]
*  And because of the power cut, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  our sons can't watch the news on the internet. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  And they spend their time playing with other kids. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=87.2s)]
*  We were in the middle of the road. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  At the end of the week, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=93.28s)]
*  we received a message that we were allowed to enter the crossing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=95.16s)]
*  So we loaded our car to try to escape again. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=99.4s)]
*  On the way there, there was a lot of hope. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=105.88s)]
*  At the crossing, there was another family full of hope. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=112.12s)]
*  They tried to escape. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=115.55999999999999s)]
*  But this hope was too fast. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  We were told that it's closed now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=122.8s)]
*  And no one was able to pass. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=125.28s)]
*  We were in the crossing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=129.56s)]
*  We waited for the order to enter the Egyptian side. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=131.6s)]
*  But the crossing is closed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=135.95999999999998s)]
*  It's only open for humanitarian aid. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=138.0s)]
*  We set out to return. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=141.88s)]
*  We are in a mess. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=143.92s)]
*  We hope that the weather will be better than today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=146.64s)]
*  We hear the air raid from a distance. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=156.12s)]
*  Are you scared? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=161.12s)]
*  But I see the fear in his eyes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=165.32s)]
*  The same fear that I see. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=168.28s)]
*  That was Ibrahim Dokman, our CNN producer, who is in Gaza tonight. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=174.84s)]
*  Hoping, hoping to be able to leave. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQE8xFhee0g&t=178.88s)]
