**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA)
*  It killed and I hope they all are. Look at the news. Look at the news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=0.0s)]
*  Those five seconds have been reposted by national influencers viewed millions of times on Instagram. Watch again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=6.0s)]
*  It killed and I hope they all are. Look at the news. Look at the news. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=14.0s)]
*  The caption attached, this USC professor John Strauss threatened these students. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=19.0s)]
*  Hope you get killed and I hope they all are. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=24.0s)]
*  During a campus rally for Gaza, we call on USC to terminate this professor immediately. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=27.0s)]
*  The college paper proclaimed tenured economics professor says, I hope they all are killed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=33.0s)]
*  Walking by event mourning Palestinian deaths. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=39.0s)]
*  Is that really what he meant or even what he said? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=42.0s)]
*  Strauss, who is Jewish and avowedly pro-Israel, appeared on the campus newscast. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=46.0s)]
*  Annenberg Media spoke with a USC professor who was put on administrative leave after a confrontation at a protest for Palestinian lives. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=52.0s)]
*  I started getting emails, very, very, very nasty emails. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=60.0s)]
*  Things from, I hope you die, you fascist pig, to Palestine forever. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=65.0s)]
*  While an actual war rages thousands of miles away, this video and its fallout typify the current conflicts on so many American college campuses. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=75.0s)]
*  We have an atmosphere that's hostile to free speech is the key problem. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=86.0s)]
*  The people who are going to college are adults, but a lot of them are acting like children. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=91.0s)]
*  They want to see people punished for their speech. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=96.0s)]
*  So what actually happened that day here in LA? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=100.0s)]
*  Well, here is a longer version of that video. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=103.0s)]
*  Twenty one seconds, not five. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=106.0s)]
*  People are sick of it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=109.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=111.0s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=112.0s)]
*  Professor Strauss, I believe. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=114.0s)]
*  And that they should all die, every one of them referred, of course, to Hamas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=117.0s)]
*  The longer video of Professor Strauss was shot and posted by this student, founder of Trojans for Palestine. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=130.0s)]
*  She asked that we obscure her identity for fear of reprisals. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=136.0s)]
*  Your identity is hidden here, but you exposed the identity of Professor Strauss. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=141.0s)]
*  So how do you kind of reconcile that? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=145.0s)]
*  Professor Strauss, first of all, like he is a grown man, like I said, tenured faculty who harassed students. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=148.0s)]
*  She says Strauss stepped on the names of the dead. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=157.0s)]
*  He said that must have been an accident. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=159.0s)]
*  Emotions, she said, were high. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=161.0s)]
*  So Zionist students were waving the Israeli flag in front of us and they were filming the names and laughing at them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=164.0s)]
*  We spoke to a Jewish student who was there remembering their own dead. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=170.0s)]
*  He did film the names and he was disrespectful. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=174.0s)]
*  He apologizes for any offense caused, but told CNN he does not know for sure that all those names are innocent dead Palestinians, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=178.0s)]
*  because the source is the Gaza Health Ministry, controlled by Hamas. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=187.0s)]
*  And that's a basic problem on these campuses. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=192.0s)]
*  The two sides barely agree even on any basic facts. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=196.0s)]
*  Trojans for Palestine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=201.0s)]
*  Why did you feel moved to create that? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=202.0s)]
*  We have a very large Jewish population on campus. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=205.0s)]
*  We have obviously the Shoah Foundation. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=208.0s)]
*  I was seeing a lot of misinformation being spread. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=210.0s)]
*  And the two sides cannot even agree on the meaning of what actually comes out of mouths at the many pro-Palestinian rallies. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=213.0s)]
*  Many pro-Palestinians say it's just a call for freedom. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=221.0s)]
*  Many Jews say it's a call for genocide, for the destruction of Israel, which right now lies between the river and the sea. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=227.0s)]
*  Is there a way back from where we are right now where both sides feel similar things in terms of their voices being suppressed? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=236.0s)]
*  On a personal level, no. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=248.0s)]
*  Once I know that someone is unequivocally going to support Israel, I will cut them out of my life. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=251.0s)]
*  Nick Watt joins us now from Los Angeles. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=257.0s)]
*  What more is USC saying about this? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=260.0s)]
*  Well, that's very interesting. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=263.0s)]
*  I mean, what they're saying basically gives us the other slice of the story, which is how college administrators across this country are struggling to deal with this. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=265.0s)]
*  They're trying to mollify and assuage or try not to offend. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=274.0s)]
*  And they're making mistakes in the process, as we've seen on Capitol Hill. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=277.0s)]
*  Here at USC, they say Strauss was never placed on administrative leave. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=281.0s)]
*  He says he was on November 10th. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=285.0s)]
*  So I kept on pushing them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=287.0s)]
*  And eventually they told me, our statement discusses his status since November 13th. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=289.0s)]
*  Not exactly clear and candid. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=295.0s)]
*  They now say that, I mean, they have said all along that they are shocked by the comments attached to those videos. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=297.0s)]
*  And they now say, you know, all restrictions are lifted. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=302.0s)]
*  He's allowed back on campus. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=305.0s)]
*  Also worth noting that classes for the semester have finished. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=306.0s)]
*  They also say he has not been punished in any way. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=310.0s)]
*  Last I heard from his lawyer, he's still under investigation and still could be punished. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=312.0s)]
*  As I say, they don't appear to know how to deal with all this stuff that is going on on college campuses. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=317.0s)]
*  And it continues to happen. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHDxzn3kgUA&t=324.0s)]
