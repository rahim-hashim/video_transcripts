# Inside the network of Hamas tunnels under Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0)
*  In his televised address here earlier today, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=0.0s)]
*  said this about sending troops into Gaza, quoting now, I will not detail when, how or [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=3.9s)]
*  how many or the overall considerations that we are taking into account, most of which [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  are unknown to the public. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=12.86s)]
*  And this is how it needs to be in order to better safeguard the lives of our soldiers. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=14.64s)]
*  Whether spoken or not, one of those considerations is certainly the network of tunnels that Hamas [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=19.52s)]
*  has built under Gaza to move undetected, store weapons and now hold hostages. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=23.82s)]
*  I'm John O'Brien, from CNN's Nick Robertson. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=29.68s)]
*  This is the invisible danger awaiting Israeli troops in Gaza. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=33.12s)]
*  Hamas tunnels, miles of them, hiding the well-armed terror groups' fighters. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=38.88s)]
*  The video, Hamas propaganda, distributed by the Israel Defense Force, shows concrete reinforced [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=45.36s)]
*  subterranean passages. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  Israeli hostage, 85-year-old Yoshaved Livshitz, saw them firsthand before she was released [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=55.92s)]
*  late Monday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=61.92s)]
*  We began walking inside the tunnels with a wet ground. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=62.92s)]
*  It was moist all the time. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=67.48s)]
*  Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad had been building tunnels under Gaza for at least a [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  decade. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=74.88s)]
*  The ceiling is made out of concrete. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=76.16s)]
*  Over the years, CNN has been shown them by both the IDF after capture. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=78.32s)]
*  And by the terror groups themselves, showing off their underground advantage as propaganda, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  a place to hide weapons. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=91.92s)]
*  Estimated at dozens of miles long, they snake underneath many of Gaza's neighborhoods and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  have become known to Israelis as the Gaza Metro. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=100.6s)]
*  These new videos the IDF is sharing appear to show a progression in sophistication and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=104.24s)]
*  therefore an increase in potential danger to troops in the event of a ground incursion [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=111.08s)]
*  into Gaza. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=116.64s)]
*  Like a 21st century equivalent of World War I trenches, these deep burrows have dugouts [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=118.28s)]
*  for storing weapons and safe rooms for fighters to plan and gather. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=125.24s)]
*  Small trap doors in the desert let militants evade advancing troops, even sneak up behind [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=130.84s)]
*  them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=137.36s)]
*  The danger down here, not just to the troops above, but to Israeli civilians too. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=138.36s)]
*  Long range rockets stored on wall brackets can be rushed forward to be fired towards [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=145.4s)]
*  Tel Aviv and other cities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=150.84s)]
*  From hidden gun pits connected directly to the tunnels, making the launch sites even [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  harder for the IDF to strike back at. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=158.74s)]
*  Shortly after an incursion, can Israel expect to fully destroy the terror tunnels? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=162.4s)]
*  Absent that, the so-called Gaza Metro will outfox and endanger Israeli soldiers and civilians [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=168.28s)]
*  alike. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=176.48000000000002s)]
*  Some of these very heavy destinations that we hear from here that you can actually feel [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  sometimes, Anderson, I think these are intended to try to penetrate deep down and take out [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=182.8s)]
*  some of those tunnels. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=189.0s)]
*  But after the 2014 incursion, the IDF went in and they used bulldozers to get rid of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=190.72s)]
*  the tunnels. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  So that really shows you even with the really heavy munitions, they're not going to be able [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  to eradicate all these threats that the troops are going to face when they get in there. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=202.16s)]
*  And that is, of course, something that plays heavily on the minds of those soldiers, knowing [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  that a militant Hamas terrorist can pop up behind them when they think they've already [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=212.11999999999998s)]
*  cleared a house or a field. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  Anderson? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=219.92s)]
*  Nick Robertson, thanks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=222.28s)]
*  I want to get some perspective on the challenges those tunnels might present for the IDF should [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=223.28s)]
*  it choose to embark on a ground incursion back with the Sinai's retired Army Colonel [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  Peter Mansour. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=231.48s)]
*  He's a former top aide to General David Petraeus, currently a professor of military history [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=232.48s)]
*  at Ohio State University. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=236.04s)]
*  So I mean, it's fascinating to see these tunnels, both in IDF video that they put out and also [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=238.2s)]
*  Hamas propaganda video. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=245.16s)]
*  Can you just talk about the challenges of dealing with a network like that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=247.0s)]
*  How do you destroy them? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=251.4s)]
*  How do you fight in them? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=253.68s)]
*  Well, preferably you don't fight in them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=255.4s)]
*  In World War Two on Iwo Jima, for instance, the Japanese had an extensive tunnel network. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=260.6s)]
*  The Marines would simply find the entrances and close them off, whether with explosives [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=265.72s)]
*  or bulldozers or flamethrowers, and they would entomb the Japanese inside. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=271.56s)]
*  In Gaza, this is a problem, though, because inside those tunnels, there may be some of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=278.56s)]
*  those hostages that Hamas has taken. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  And of course, you want to free them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  But fighting inside tunnels is slow, dirty work, claustrophobic and very, very dangerous. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=288.96s)]
*  And it advantages the defender. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  So I don't think the Israeli Defense Forces really want to get into a close knockdown, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=297.64s)]
*  drag out fight inside those tunnels. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=303.16s)]
*  Even mapping or gathering information about the tunnels must be extremely difficult. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=308.64s)]
*  Yes, you might be able to, with persistent surveillance, find the entrances and exits. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=315.8s)]
*  Where the tunnels lead, how they snake around underground, almost impossible to tell from [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=322.84000000000003s)]
*  overhead reconnaissance. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  The Israelis, as they advance forward with their ground offensive, are going to have [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  to leave troops in the rear to secure their rear areas. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=334.48s)]
*  They can't assume that once they've cleared a building, for instance, that there aren't [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  hatches through which the militants can come up from the ground behind them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  And in a dense urban environment like Gaza, with obviously now lots of debris around, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=351.68s)]
*  I know they have bulldozers as well, but how vulnerable are APCs, tanks in urban combat? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=359.04s)]
*  Well, it's a misnomer that urban combat is just infantry combat. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=367.52s)]
*  The best force to use in urban combat is a combined arms team that has tanks, that has [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=373.08s)]
*  infantry fighting vehicles, but they need to be protected on the ground by dismounted [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=380.44s)]
*  infantry and overhead by air defense and air force assets. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=385.52s)]
*  So the combined arms team rules the modern battlefield, and that's as true in the urban [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=390.52s)]
*  environment as it is in the open desert. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=395.24s)]
*  And how do you think this conflict, and we've talked, you and I have talked about Mosul, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=400.32s)]
*  about the US experience there, Iraqi forces experiences there. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=407.36s)]
*  How big, or Fallujah, were the civilian populations pretty much cleared out of both of those places? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=412.36s)]
*  In Fallujah, yes. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=421.64s)]
*  The US forces and Iraqi forces surrounded Fallujah, gave them several weeks to clear [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=423.04s)]
*  out before they went in. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=428.8s)]
*  So that was a fairly clean battlefield, if you will. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=430.0s)]
*  Mosul still had some civilians, although far fewer than are in Gaza. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=434.88s)]
*  And there were civilian casualties in that fighting, but the way that the US and Iraqi [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=441.96s)]
*  forces went about clearing Mosul reduced those casualties using special forces and targeted [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=450.92s)]
*  airstrikes. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=456.56s)]
*  If you go in with a big heavy ground invasion, as the Israelis might be planning, then there's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=457.84s)]
*  going to be a lot of death and destruction in the path of the advance. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=463.36s)]
*  And if civilians are in those buildings as they're assaulted, they're going to, a lot [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  of them are going to die. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=471.52s)]
*  And so is that the idea of more limited incursion with special forces? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=475.24s)]
*  Is that something you would recommend in a situation given the number of hostages and [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=483.03999999999996s)]
*  the civilian population still there? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=488.4s)]
*  Well, there's a Marine three-star general in Israel right now who's probably recommending [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=491.04s)]
*  that course of action to the Israeli defense forces to do it the way we did it in Mosul. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=495.72s)]
*  But there's a drawback to that. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  It takes longer. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=503.24s)]
*  And there's a calculation that the Israeli government needs to make. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=504.88s)]
*  How long is the world community going to give them once they go in with ground forces? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  Can they afford a several-month-long battle versus something that will be quicker but [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  more deadly? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=519.6s)]
*  Colonel Peter Menchor, thank you. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=523.0799999999999s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndqjS_QYtU0&t=524.4s)]
