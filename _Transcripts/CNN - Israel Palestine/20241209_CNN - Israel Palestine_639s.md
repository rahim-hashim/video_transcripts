# Expert explains why track record for toppled dictators is 'not an inspiring one'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI)

*  Assad fleeing with his family to Russia, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=38.56s)]

*  This regime brutalized and tortured and killed literally [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=55.12s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of innocent Syrians for the first time ever. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=59.62s)]
*  Either Russia nor Iran or Hezbollah could defend this abhorrent [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=63.28s)]

*  This victory, my brothers, is a victory for the entire Islamic nation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=89.48s)]
*  This new triumph, my brothers, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=94.44s)]
*  marks a new chapter in the history of the region. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=96.6s)]

*  Former state department Middle East negotiator, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=113.84s)]
*  Aaron David Miller joins us now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=115.44000000000001s)]
*  He's a senior fellow now at the Carnegie endowment for international peace. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=117.0s)]
*  Sir, thanks very much for being with us this morning. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=121.28s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Casey. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  So let's start with this rebel leader Abu Mohammed Al Jolani, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  what we know about him, about the group he leads and what that means for [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=131.0s)]
*  America's interests and security. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=135.72s)]
*  Well, you know, Ahmad Sharif is his real name. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=141.0s)]
*  He's been showing up not in at least one interview in suits. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=143.56s)]
*  He's allowing the international media in, which is a very good sign. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=148.18s)]
*  He's saying and doing all the right things with respect to talking about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=152.0s)]
*  inclusion and protecting the rights of minorities. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=155.72s)]
*  The HTS is center representative to Latakia, the Aloe stronghold, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=158.88s)]
*  to assure the Aloe minority that there won't be retribution [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=163.52s)]
*  against regime supporters. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=167.84s)]
*  All of this strikes me as a as headlines, Casey. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=169.48000000000002s)]
*  The question is whether the trend lines will hold as HTS [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  and the complex and consolidated sort of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=179.52s)]
*  loose alliance of Islamist groups begin to deal not with the issue of rebelling. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=184.4s)]
*  That's hard. But governing is harder. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=190.12s)]
*  And look, the reality is the track record here for overthrowing Middle [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=192.28s)]
*  East dictators is not an inspiring one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=196.88s)]
*  In Egypt, Barak was overthrown. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=199.32000000000002s)]
*  Repressive government followed. In Libya, Gaddafi was overthrown. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=201.20000000000002s)]
*  Libya is plunged into internal chaos and division. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=204.88s)]
*  In Yemen, Abd al-Salah overthrown. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  The Houthis govern large parts of the area. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  It's in Iraq, which may be the best example. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  Saddam is overthrown. And yet Iraq, in so many respects, is dysfunctional. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=216.24s)]
*  So the real question, I think, is whether or not you can [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=220.88s)]
*  convert this extraordinary moment, which demonstrates [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=224.6s)]
*  the importance of individuals in for good or ill [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=229.0s)]
*  in the course of human events, whether or not Jalani and the movement [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=234.16s)]
*  he holds will be able to reconcile itself and its Islamic principles [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  and the tasks of nation building in a traumatized society [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=243.16s)]
*  of 23 million people, which is driven by sectarian divisions. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  That's the real key here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=252.55999999999997s)]
*  And again, headlines look pretty good. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  The question is where the trend lines going. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=257.76s)]
*  Sir, what does this say about the bigger players that are really [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=260.76s)]
*  pulling the strings behind the scenes, notably Russia and Iran? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=266.28s)]
*  The fact that this happened, where Assad has gone and what that means, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=270.8s)]
*  not just for the future of Syria, but for Iran, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=274.68s)]
*  its nuclear program, for Russia, its war in Ukraine, for all of it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=278.48s)]
*  Yeah. You know, the civil war [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=283.56s)]
*  paradoxically opened the door to foreign powers. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=286.44s)]
*  The Iranians, as you point out, the Russians, which became the key [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=290.68s)]
*  power broker in saving Assad, the Turks, who have a complex relationship [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=293.92s)]
*  with Kurds, they have three million refugees. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=298.36s)]
*  They have a liaison relationship with HTS. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=300.8s)]
*  They wanted this to happen because more refugees in Turkey will go back. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=303.28s)]
*  And the Kurds figure they'll take advantage of this in order to strike [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=307.32s)]
*  a blow at U.S. supported Kurdish forces. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  But I think now you have a situation in which Russia and Iran are playing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=314.11999999999995s)]
*  less of a role. His ball is weakened and hollowed out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=318.44s)]
*  Israelis are certainly acting for the first time in 50 plus years. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=321.35999999999996s)]
*  They entered the 1974 disengagement zone. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  Prime Minister says it's temporary. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=329.0s)]
*  We'll see about that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=333.04s)]
*  But I think the Syrians actually now have a degree of agency that they've never had [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=334.68s)]
*  before. And we can't fix Syria. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=338.72s)]
*  I think the president-elect had made it unmistakably clear that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  he wants no part of it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=347.48s)]
*  He wanted to withdraw U.S. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=349.16s)]
*  forces from Syria, the 900 that are deployed in the eastern part of the country. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=350.56s)]
*  He had to be talked out of it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  And I suspect without a compelling reason that benefits him, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=357.56s)]
*  I suspect he'll want to push the Americans deployed there through the exit. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  So the regional powers are going to continue to meddle. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=366.44s)]
*  The question is whether the Syrians can grab the opportunity that they have and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=370.24s)]
*  lead this country into a better future. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=374.04s)]
*  Unclear at this point, Casey, really unclear. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  For sure. All right, Aaron, David Miller, starting us off this morning, sir. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=379.88s)]
*  Thanks very much for your time and expertise. I appreciate it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=382.28000000000003s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has ordered the Israeli military [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=384.48s)]
*  to seize a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=387.88s)]
*  decades. It comes as Israel warned residents of the area to stay [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=392.36s)]
*  in their homes. Let's bring in CNN's Paula Hancock's in Abu Dhabi. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=396.36s)]
*  I mean, there have been various sort of movements, haven't they, involving [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=399.48s)]
*  countries outside Syria within the country? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=404.04s)]
*  This is an opportunity to, you [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=408.8s)]
*  know, make some movements around this chaos. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=413.12s)]
*  I mean, how do you how do you regard it? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=416.68s)]
*  Well, Max, I think at this point, Israel would be concerned and we've we've heard [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=423.48s)]
*  that they're concerned, as many that have a border with Syria are as to what [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=428.04s)]
*  comes next. So what we've heard from the defense minister, Israel Katz, is that he [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=433.76s)]
*  has ordered the military to station soldiers, military personnel in this buffer [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=438.08s)]
*  zone. It's a there's a sort of heightened strategic position of Mount [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=444.64s)]
*  Herman, which sits just on the border between Israel, the Golan Heights, which [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  Israel took from Syria in the 1967 war and has since since annexed Lebanon and [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=455.2s)]
*  Syria. So it's a key area which we heard from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=462.28s)]
*  Netanyahu. They decided to move into when they saw that the regime soldiers [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=467.12s)]
*  from Syria, the Assad regime soldiers, were moving out. They were concerned about [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=474.56s)]
*  a vacuum there and who might fill that vacuum. So what we're hearing from the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=480.52s)]
*  Israeli side is that they are within this area. Now, it's an area they have not [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=485.16s)]
*  been in for decades, but it is an area they believe they have to station soldiers [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=489.52s)]
*  in. Let's listen to the prime minister. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=494.72s)]
*  This is a historic day for the Middle East. The collapse of the Assad regime, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=498.24s)]
*  the tyranny in Damascus offers great opportunity, but also is fraught with [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=503.52s)]
*  significant dangers. One of them is the collapse of the Separation of Forces [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=508.32s)]
*  Agreement from 1974 between Israel and Syria. This agreement held for 50 years. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=512.72s)]
*  Last night it collapsed. The Syrian army abandoned its positions. We gave the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=518.8s)]
*  Israeli army the order to take over those positions to ensure that no hostile [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  force embeds itself right next to the border of Israel. This is a temporary [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=529.92s)]
*  defensive position until a suitable arrangement is found. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=533.68s)]
*  The IDF has issued warnings to residents of Syria in that buffer zone itself to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=540.68s)]
*  stay inside. They have also ordered the Israeli military to make sure that [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=546.32s)]
*  there is no kind of smuggling of weapons from Iran to Lebanon through Syria. So [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=553.08s)]
*  that's another key reason why the Israeli military believes it does need [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=559.6s)]
*  to be there. Now we did hear that there were airstrikes overnight in the Syrian [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=563.52s)]
*  capital of Damascus. Our CNN team on the ground reported that. It wasn't [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=569.32s)]
*  immediately clear who was responsible for that. We have heard from Reuters [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=573.24s)]
*  saying they believe it was the Israeli military, but the military not commenting [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  on that. We did see though just last Friday a rare acknowledgement from [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=584.16s)]
*  Israel that they had carried out airstrikes in Damascus. Usually they [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=589.4399999999999s)]
*  don't admit to strikes in countries outside of their domain. But it's [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=594.0s)]
*  certainly a concern for Israel. They had had this uneasy truce, if you like, on [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=601.5999999999999s)]
*  that border with Syria. Not that they were particularly supportive or liked [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=607.96s)]
*  the Assad regime, considering there was plenty of weapons smuggling that went [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=614.0400000000001s)]
*  through that area to the detriment of Israel. But it was a border they did not [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=619.24s)]
*  feel the need to guard quite so heavily. So they now have these troops in this [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=624.88s)]
*  buffer zone, which separates the Golan Heights and Syria. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj7IftfF2vI&t=630.24s)]
