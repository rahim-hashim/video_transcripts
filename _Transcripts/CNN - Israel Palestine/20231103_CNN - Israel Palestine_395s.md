# Ex-CIA director weighs in on the use of drones to locate hostages held by Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says there will be no temporary ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=0.0s)]
*  unless all hostages held by Hamas are freed. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=4.34s)]
*  That is despite Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for a pause today as he met [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=7.68s)]
*  with Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=11.64s)]
*  Meantime, in his first public remarks since the conflict began, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=13.88s)]
*  Nasrallah, praised Hamas' attacks on Israel while adding that Hezbollah's primary goal [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=18.72s)]
*  is a ceasefire. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=24.44s)]
*  He said the possibility of a larger regional conflict with Israel is a, quote, realistic [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=25.9s)]
*  option. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=30.66s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss is Leon Panetta. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=31.66s)]
*  He's a former Secretary of Defense and CIA Director in the Obama administration. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=33.62s)]
*  Sir, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=38.06s)]
*  The leader of Hezbollah making a lot of threats, not offering many specifics though. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=40.86s)]
*  How precarious do you think the situation is right now along Israel's northern border? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=46.379999999999995s)]
*  I don't think there's any question, but the situation remains precarious. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=53.78s)]
*  We're in the middle of the war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=60.42s)]
*  Israel is proceeding to go after Hamas if they're right, and they have in fact taken [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  out Hamas leaders and are continuing to do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=69.9s)]
*  If Hamas feels that their back is against the wall, there's no question in my mind [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=75.1s)]
*  that they're going to ask for help. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=81.74s)]
*  And they'll turn to Iran, obviously turn to Hezbollah, all of Iran's proxies in the region, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=84.82s)]
*  from Iraq down to Yemen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  And so I think the potential for a possible expansion of this war is real. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=94.66s)]
*  Secretary, CNN has learned that the U.S. military is sending surveillance drones to fly over [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=100.5s)]
*  Gaza to try to help the IDF locate hostages. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=106.89999999999999s)]
*  Can you tell us about the capabilities of those drones, especially in a situation where [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=110.66000000000001s)]
*  the hostages are likely being held in tunnels underground? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=114.98s)]
*  Well, I think it's very important. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=121.78s)]
*  If you're going to do the kind of targeting that I think is necessary to be able to go [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=124.14s)]
*  after Hamas, you're going to have to not only use drones, you're going to have to use human [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=128.86s)]
*  intelligence as well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=136.78s)]
*  That's pretty much what we did in going after al-Qaeda after 9-11. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=139.42s)]
*  And we could not have been able to establish those targets without the help of drones, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=146.22s)]
*  but also without the help of human intelligence, people on the ground. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=152.7s)]
*  So I'm hoping they can get that kind of combination working with them, because that is the most [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=157.5s)]
*  effective way to make sure that you are accurate in going after Hamas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=163.22s)]
*  President Biden and his administration has been urging Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=170.38s)]
*  Netanyahu to consider pausing its operation in Gaza for a series of different humanitarian [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=176.06s)]
*  objectives. Netanyahu is determined to press ahead and not have any kind of cessation of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=182.1s)]
*  hostilities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=188.74s)]
*  What's the correct course of action, you think, from both a political and a military [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  perspective, if you were advising the prime minister? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'm glad that Secretary Blinken went to the area and asked for that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=201.3s)]
*  kind of humanitarian pause. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=208.42000000000002s)]
*  I think it's very important for the United States at the highest level to stay in touch [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=210.38s)]
*  with the leadership, not just in Israel, but in the countries that adjoin Israel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=214.78s)]
*  Look, this is a situation where the issue is going to be, is the price right for Netanyahu? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=222.94s)]
*  He obviously is in the middle of a war. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=234.06s)]
*  His tanks are there. His troops are there. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=237.82s)]
*  They're going after Hamas. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=241.06s)]
*  He's not particularly interested in slowing that process down. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=243.42s)]
*  We all understand that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  On the other side, Hamas is holding these hostages and very frankly, they don't care a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=249.94s)]
*  lot about the human side of these hostages. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=255.26s)]
*  The question is going to be what kind of price do they get if they're going to release the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=259.65999999999997s)]
*  hostages? So right now, I don't know that the price is right on either side. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=264.02s)]
*  What could possibly help is to be able to develop an approach where you want Hamas to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=269.98s)]
*  release the hostages, but in return, they're going to get the release of Palestinian [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=276.5s)]
*  prisoners. That could, I think, be possibly the kind of price that might result in that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  kind of deal being fulfilled. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=288.86s)]
*  As those negotiations, those conversations are ongoing specifically to get hostages out, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm wondering what you make of that apparent disagreement between the United States and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=298.54s)]
*  Israel over the correct course of action to take on a pause. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=304.54s)]
*  Well, you know, I think the president's been right to urge a pause. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=312.46s)]
*  There is a pause that is necessary in order to be able to provide the humanitarian relief [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=316.58s)]
*  that is critical for the Palestinians and it's critical for others that obviously have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=323.53999999999996s)]
*  been injured in this war. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=329.34s)]
*  So it's the right thing to do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=331.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think, you know, from my own experience, I think the key is to continue to pressure the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=334.41999999999996s)]
*  Israelis to be able to provide not only a pause, but to make it possible to get [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=341.46s)]
*  humanitarian aid into Gaza so that we can provide the food and the care that is [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=352.06s)]
*  essential to deal with those that have been injured. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=361.7s)]
*  I think if Israel needs to know that while there is a lot of support, obviously, for their [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=365.18s)]
*  ability to defend their country and go after Hamas, that in order for them to be able to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=371.7s)]
*  maintain their credibility, they also have to keep an eye on how to provide humanitarian [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=378.94s)]
*  relief to those that have been hurt. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=384.46s)]
*  Secretary Leon Panetta, thanks so much for sharing your time and perspective with us. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=387.62s)]
*  Good to be with you. Of course. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRkHKa3I5bg&t=393.14s)]
