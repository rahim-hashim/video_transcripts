# US believes Iran is preparing to imminently launch attack against Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g)
*  This is CNN breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=0.0s)]
*  Alright, we do have breaking news, perhaps very important breaking news. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=3.6s)]
*  Stemming from the tension, the conflict in the Middle East right now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=8.2s)]
*  Israel launched ground incursions into Lebanon overnight, targeting Hezbollah, the terror [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  group that operates inside Lebanon. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=17.56s)]
*  We are getting a sense this morning that Hezbollah, which is a client of Iran, may be about to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=20.14s)]
*  get assistance from Iran itself. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=26.42s)]
*  I believe CNN's Arlette signs is ready at the White House for us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=29.56s)]
*  Arlette, the White House has new concerns about what Iran may be about to do. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=33.36s)]
*  What are you learning? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=38.16s)]
*  Yes, John, a senior White House official is telling us that the U.S. believes that Iran [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=39.16s)]
*  may imminently launch a ballistic missile against Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=44.92s)]
*  I want to read you a quote that we have from a senior White House official who says the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=49.44s)]
*  United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=53.56s)]
*  missile attack against Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=57.68s)]
*  We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=59.6s)]
*  A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=64.56s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=70.76s)]
*  Now, this comes as U.S. officials had had some concern that Iran might try to launch [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=71.76s)]
*  some type of a retaliatory attack against Israel in the wake of Israel's killing of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on Friday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=82.84s)]
*  The U.S. has been in close coordination with Israel over the past few days, particularly [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=86.64s)]
*  zeroing in on their joint defense efforts. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  And various statements from the Pentagon have made clear that the U.S. would be ready to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  protect the interests of U.S. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=100.6s)]
*  personnel as well as U.S. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=102.72s)]
*  allies and partners if Iran or any of its proxies were to take steps to try to launch [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=105.0s)]
*  this type of attack against Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=111.84s)]
*  So we will see what exactly the U.S. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  is preparing to do in this moment. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  The Pentagon has stressed that they have significant capabilities in the region, including a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  carrier strike group. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. has also made moves to try to increase the force readiness posture in the region [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=126.0s)]
*  to activate potentially if needed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=131.6s)]
*  But it does come as U.S. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  officials have been watching the situation with great concern and the possibility of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=134.84s)]
*  an attack by Iran. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=140.16s)]
*  Now, you'll remember that back in April, the U.S. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=141.56s)]
*  actually led a multinational effort to try to defend Israel in the wake or in anticipation [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=144.0s)]
*  of some attacks from Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=151.2s)]
*  So we will see if there is a similar type of mobilization that goes into effect to try [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=153.32s)]
*  to intercept any type of missile that could be coming Israel's way. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=157.48s)]
*  But this morning we are receiving word from a senior White House official that the U.S. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=161.32s)]
*  is preparing for the possibility of an imminent ballistic missile attack by Iran against Israel [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=165.84s)]
*  at any time. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=172.16s)]
*  All right, stand by for a second here. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=173.16s)]
*  Just need people a sense of the geography about what we're talking about here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=174.68s)]
*  Israel right here launched these ground incursions into Lebanon overnight, focusing and targeting [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  on Hezbollah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  What we're concerned about now, the White House is not return fire from Hezbollah and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=184.8s)]
*  Lebanon but this turning into a more regional conflict. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=188.88s)]
*  Iran launching ballistic missiles into Israel. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=193.36s)]
*  Now, as Arlette noted, this did happen once before. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  There was this exchange, frankly, between Iran and Israel where Israel launched into [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=200.12s)]
*  where Iran launched into Israel. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=206.36s)]
*  Then the United States with the Israelis, the Jordanians, the British were able to repel [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  almost all of those launches. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=212.12s)]
*  Israel retaliated. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  Again, that was seen a little bit as a show. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  Arlette, if you're still with me, any sense whether the United States has concern this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=220.72s)]
*  time that what Iran will try to do here is perhaps a more intense strike or a strike [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=229.2s)]
*  with the intention to target Israeli cities, maybe even Tel Aviv? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=235.6s)]
*  It's not exactly clear what the U.S. is expecting in this moment. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=240.92s)]
*  All that we know is that they are saying that they believe that Iran will be imminently [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=244.92s)]
*  planning a ballistic missile attack against Israel. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, it does come, as you have heard U.S. officials really across the board stress their [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=254.44s)]
*  belief that there needed to be some preparations for the possibility of an Iranian attack against [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=260.24s)]
*  Israel in the wake of the killing of Nasrallah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=267.28s)]
*  You have seen the Pentagon talk about some of the capabilities that they have on hand [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=270.64000000000004s)]
*  to potentially respond or deter any type of attack. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=275.88s)]
*  But it has just come, as U.S. officials have been watching with this closely, they haven't [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  detailed exactly what or where this Iranian missile attack might be heading. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=284.12s)]
*  But it will be something that they will be trying to work with the Israelis to try to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=290.68s)]
*  prevent if they can. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=293.68s)]
*  And to be clear, Arlette, the United States has had a presence in the region. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=295.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, carrier fleets that have been operating both in the Mediterranean that at times down [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  here or at times even in the Red Sea. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=303.36s)]
*  There has been an effort by the Biden administration to position military assets in case something [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  like this would happen, correct? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=312.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and that is something that the Pentagon has been stressing over the past two days. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=314.68s)]
*  They've said that they have significant capabilities in the region, specifically pointing out that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=319.44000000000005s)]
*  they do have that carrier strike group. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=324.16s)]
*  You also had just yesterday, they said that an unspecified number of troops from the U.S. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=326.56s)]
*  have been preparing to potentially deploy if needed. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=332.52s)]
*  So this is something where the U.S. could try to utilize some of their defense capabilities [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=336.76s)]
*  to try to help Israel defend themselves in this moment. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=341.4s)]
*  Arlette, stand by as we get more information from the White House. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=344.44s)]
*  I want to go back to Tel Aviv. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  CNN's Chief National Security Analyst Jim Sciutto is with us now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=348.84s)]
*  And Jim, the breaking news, new reporting that the White House has intelligence that [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=352.36s)]
*  Iran could be preparing a ballistic missile strike on Israel. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=357.44s)]
*  The significance of that, what it means for the place that you're standing right now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=361.6s)]
*  Listen, it's enormously significant. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=368.36s)]
*  This is just the outcome, a direct conflict between Iran and Israel that frankly President [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=370.32s)]
*  Biden and other U.S. officials had been hoping to avoid. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=376.32s)]
*  It's not unprecedented. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=379.48s)]
*  Of course, you'll remember that in April, Iran launched dozens of missiles and drones [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=380.72s)]
*  towards Israel, which we should note, the vast majority of which were shot down not [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=385.72s)]
*  just by Israel, but by U.S. forces as well as other partners in the region, including [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=391.48s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=396.0s)]
*  So we have been here before. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=397.32s)]
*  But for this to happen in the midst of what has become a multi-front war for Israel now, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  not just in Gaza, of course, you now have Israeli boots on the ground in southern Lebanon [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  and you had a strike just in the last couple of days by Israel 1,500 miles away against [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=409.16s)]
*  Houthi rebels in Yemen as well. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=415.04s)]
*  To add another front to that, it's really, it's extremely volatile, it's dangerous. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=417.68s)]
*  And of course, why I'm standing here would be a likely target. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=424.6s)]
*  Now we should note that Tel Aviv has its own formidable missile defenses at several levels. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=427.16s)]
*  Of course, you talk about the Iron Dome, but you also have ones at higher altitudes intended [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=433.04s)]
*  for ballistic missiles, including what's known as David's sling. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  So they have capabilities to defend. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=441.04s)]
*  But the risk, the danger, the fear, John, is that Iran might attempt to overwhelm those [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  defenses by firing a large number of missiles at the same time so that Israel could not [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=448.92s)]
*  shoot them all down or Israel and its allies. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  It's a significant, it would be a significant escalation. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=456.32s)]
*  And I think it's notable for the White House to say this so publicly right now. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=459.12s)]
*  So Jim, obviously this is in response to what's happening inside Lebanon. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=463.04s)]
*  Israel, of course, has conducted all these operations against Hezbollah leaders there [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=467.48s)]
*  over the last few weeks, ground incursions overnight. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=471.04s)]
*  Hezbollah is a client of Iran. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=473.64s)]
*  You have done significant reporting, not just in Israel where you are right now, but also [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=476.2s)]
*  here in Iran. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=480.8s)]
*  What pressures do you think the new Iranian leadership is facing to respond to what's [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=482.48s)]
*  happening in Lebanon? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=488.56s)]
*  Listen, you know, these proxy fighters, when you talk of Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthi rebels, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=489.56s)]
*  these were built deliberately by Iran over many years to be means of projecting force [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJI4eJEAC8g&t=498.68s)]
