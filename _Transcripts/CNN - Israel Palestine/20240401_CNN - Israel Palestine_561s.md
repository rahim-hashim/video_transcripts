# See protests in Jerusalem calling for Netanyahu to resign
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto)
*  Well, as Netanyahu was speaking on Sunday, thousands were again taking to the streets [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=0.0s)]
*  of Jerusalem and other Israeli cities, calling for his resignation and the release of all [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=4.8s)]
*  hostages in Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Now, the protests are still ongoing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=11.72s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister met with the family of one of the hostages on Sunday. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=14.72s)]
*  The father of 19-year-old Naama Levi told Israel's army radio that they left the meeting, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  quote, disturbed and with no good news. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=27.64s)]
*  Nadav Salzberger from the Change Generation Movement is leading the Tel Aviv protests. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=33.08s)]
*  And he told the UK's Telegraph newspaper on Sunday that the protests over the weekend [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=39.24s)]
*  were, quote, an eruption of underground currents that have reached the boiling point. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=44.3s)]
*  And he joins us now live from Jerusalem. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=51.08s)]
*  Great to see you, Nadav. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time today. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=55.6s)]
*  Look, over the weekend, we saw an eruption of anti-government protests across many parts [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=58.24s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=66.64s)]
*  But your specific movement is calling for something very specific. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=67.64s)]
*  I want you to take me through what you and your members want. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=72.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  So first of all, I want to start by mentioning the 134 hostages still held captive in Gaza [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  including women, elderly, and children. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  We are fighting and praying for their immediate release. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  We are a movement called the Change Generation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=92.64s)]
*  After October 7th, we realized that Netanyahu and his coalition have no intent of taking [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=95.92s)]
*  responsibility over the worst disaster in Israel's history. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=100.72s)]
*  So we have taken to the streets and we formed a young movement comprised of young Israelis, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  reservists, and students with the goal of replacing the current government with a responsible [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=110.84s)]
*  government, one deserving of the Israeli people. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=115.76s)]
*  That is our goal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=119.2s)]
*  So you're calling for elections and a change in governments essentially? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=122.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=126.4s)]
*  Yeah, we're calling for elections. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=127.4s)]
*  Over and above, of course, importantly, and the release of hostages, which is important. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=130.4s)]
*  But you've also said something interesting and just reading up about what your movement [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=135.08s)]
*  is about, that Netanyahu hasn't prioritized hostages. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=138.12s)]
*  So what do you think he has prioritized instead? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  I think that Netanyahu has prioritized the survival of his own political survival and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=147.68s)]
*  the survival of his coalition. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=154.2s)]
*  I think that while many people, including politicians, are doing their best to try and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=156.72s)]
*  bring back the hostages, it simply isn't enough. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=162.2s)]
*  I think that we as the young generation who grew up under Netanyahu have witnessed rotten [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  leadership and it's time for us to step up and demand better leadership for all Israelis. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  So Netanyahu has rejected calls for elections saying that it's going to dismantle the talks [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=180.96s)]
*  that are currently underway, specifically for hostage release. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=187.96s)]
*  We also know that Hamas has said that all hostages will be released if there's a sustained [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=192.04s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  So what are your views on the current negotiations and importantly on a ceasefire? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=198.68s)]
*  We believe that the war against Hamas is a just war. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=206.72s)]
*  We believe that Hamas is a threat not only to Israelis but also to Palestinians and that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=210.84s)]
*  Israel must triumph over Hamas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=216.0s)]
*  That is why we are not calling for a ceasefire. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=219.02s)]
*  We believe that the war needs to be fought until the end, but we also believe that we [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  should prioritize bringing back the hostages even if it means pausing the same way we paused [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=226.5s)]
*  a couple of months ago to bring back hostages. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=233.18s)]
*  And we also believe that declaring a schedule for elections a couple of months from now [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=236.82000000000002s)]
*  will not hurt or damage neither the war efforts or the efforts to bring back the hostages, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=244.04s)]
*  but rather allow the current government to act without being dependent on politics or [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=249.6s)]
*  its own survival. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=258.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and of course, families of hostages, we've heard just harrowing stories of, you [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=260.04s)]
*  know, the uncertainty that they're experiencing. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=267.56s)]
*  I want to turn now to the UN Security Council resolution that within it, it said that famine [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=271.0s)]
*  is setting in in Gaza right now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=276.11999999999995s)]
*  You know, from what we've been seeing and Netanyahu's policies essentially of not allowing [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=279.03999999999996s)]
*  enough aid into Gaza has gotten a lot of criticism from aid organizations. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=283.76s)]
*  They're describing dire realities. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=288.08s)]
*  From your perspective, how are you viewing this? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=290.4s)]
*  And does this worry you and your members importantly? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  Again, I think we are worried for our future in Israel, for the future of the region. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=298.28s)]
*  I think that what we have seen yesterday in Jerusalem are hundreds of thousands of patriots [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=304.76s)]
*  going to the streets and demanding a better future. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=310.96s)]
*  I think we are done waiting for politicians to make things better. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=315.11999999999995s)]
*  I think that we need to make them better and that we, the young people in Israel, are the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=318.96s)]
*  generation that will bring change to the region and to Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=324.72s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that I don't think I know that we plan on continuing our approach. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=331.92s)]
*  All right, Nadev Salzburger, great to have you on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=340.48s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=342.72s)]
*  CNN is also learning that senior U.S. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=344.24s)]
*  and Israeli officials will meet virtually today to discuss Israel's proposed ground [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  offensive in Raffa. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=352.36s)]
*  A U.S. official says the two sides are still working towards an in-person meeting on the issue. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=353.8s)]
*  Face-to-face talks were abruptly called off last week by the Israeli prime minister after [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=359.8s)]
*  Washington refused to block a U.N. resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=364.96s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu says U.S. pressure will not stop an Israeli ground operation in Raffa. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=370.64s)]
*  We will go into Raffa and eliminate Hamas battalions there for one simple reason. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=378.76s)]
*  There is no victory without entering Raffa and there is no victory without eliminating Hamas battalions there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=383.36s)]
*  All right, well, talk's back on and I want to head to Washington now and bring in CNN's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=391.36s)]
*  Natasha Bertrand. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=395.92s)]
*  Natasha, I want to get into what the U.S. has repeatedly said and it's warned Israel [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=397.92s)]
*  about a siege into Raffa. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=404.36s)]
*  In this virtual meeting aimed at Netanyahu, do you think that he's going to be able to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=406.44s)]
*  convince the U.S. that they have a workable plan? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=412.26s)]
*  Can the U.S. be convinced of a Raffa operation? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=416.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, the answer is that it really depends because as of right now the U.S. is extremely [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  skeptical and they have been urging Israeli officials, including in talks with the Israeli [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=424.94s)]
*  defense minister last week, to come up with an alternative plan, one that is not what [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=429.14s)]
*  the Israelis have been planning, such as a large-scale ground operation into Raffa that [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=434.74s)]
*  could endanger the over one million Palestinians that have sought shelter there over the last [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=439.14s)]
*  few months. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=443.46s)]
*  And what the Israelis are saying is that, look, we need a way to eliminate these remaining [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=444.46s)]
*  Hamas battalions. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=448.94s)]
*  And the U.S. is responding, well, you know, you could go after them with a more targeted [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=449.94s)]
*  approach, something that targets more senior figures in Hamas rather than going in and [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  doing an all-out assault. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=459.3s)]
*  And so I think what the U.S. is still waiting to see from the Israelis is a concrete plan [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  to move those civilians out of the area. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=465.97999999999996s)]
*  And that is something that Israel has not been able to provide them with yet. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=468.86s)]
*  And until they do, until they provide some kind of blueprint for how they're going to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=472.34000000000003s)]
*  get those people out of that area, perhaps allowing them to move back north, then the [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=476.86s)]
*  U.S. is really not going to be on board with this. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=481.1s)]
*  Now, among the proposals the U.S. has given to the Israelis is to ramp up talks with the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=483.38s)]
*  Egyptians to try to seal that border so that Israel can conduct these more precision operations [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=488.7s)]
*  targeting these senior Hamas leaders without the possibility that they're just going to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=494.38s)]
*  then escape, of course, across the border into Egypt. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=498.74s)]
*  Of course, another aspect of this is that really targeted operation that the U.S. says [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=501.94s)]
*  that the Israelis should try. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=508.14s)]
*  And that's something that they have been pushing them to do for months and months instead of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  doing these large-scale operations that really do endanger the civilians there. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=512.9399999999999s)]
*  But the Israelis are going to do what they're going to do. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=517.06s)]
*  And that is the message that we got last week in talks with Israeli officials, is that they [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=520.1s)]
*  are going to do what they believe is best for eliminating the remaining Hamas battalions [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=524.14s)]
*  in that area. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=529.9s)]
*  Now, whether there are any consequences for the Israelis ignoring the Americans' advice, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=530.9s)]
*  that remains to be seen because we have seen that the U.S. has continued to provide them [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=536.62s)]
*  with weapons, with intelligence to help them prosecute this war against Hamas. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=541.22s)]
*  And so the question now is, are there any red lines here? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=546.1800000000001s)]
*  If the Israelis do move forward with this operation in Ra'afah, how is the U.S. going [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=548.7s)]
*  to respond, especially if it's in a way that the U.S. has explicitly advised against? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=552.02s)]
*  Alini. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=557.02s)]
*  All right, Natasha Bertrain, great to have you on. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=558.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRKIfnQnWto&t=560.94s)]
