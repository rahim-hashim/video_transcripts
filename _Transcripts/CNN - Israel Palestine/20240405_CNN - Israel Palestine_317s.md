# Israeli journalist says Netanyahu is Israelâ€™s worst prime minister
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs)
*  President Biden is not alone in expressing his frustration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=0.0s)]
*  over how Netanyahu is conducting this war. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=3.44s)]
*  Many Israelis are also angry and voicing their outrage, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=5.92s)]
*  holding nightly protests, demanding not only [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=8.52s)]
*  that the Netanyahu government focus more on a deal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=10.48s)]
*  to bring home the remaining hostages, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=12.98s)]
*  but also many of them calling for Israel's longest-serving [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=14.98s)]
*  prime minister in history to resign. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=17.92s)]
*  My next guest says, quote, Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=20.72s)]
*  is Israel's worst prime minister ever, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=23.64s)]
*  and that Netanyahu's obsession with his own destiny [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=26.1s)]
*  as Israel's protector has caused his country [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=28.3s)]
*  grievous damage. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=31.1s)]
*  And Anshel Pfeffer joins us now from Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=34.2s)]
*  Anshel, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=36.18s)]
*  In your article, you write that Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  had he accepted defeat in 2021, perhaps today [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=40.3s)]
*  he would have been remembered as one of Israel's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=43.86s)]
*  most successful prime ministers. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  Instead, you write, quote, he has brought far-right [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=47.44s)]
*  extremists into the mainstream of government [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=50.540000000000006s)]
*  and made himself and the country beholden to them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=52.46s)]
*  His corruption is flamboyant, and he has made [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  terrible security decisions that brought existential [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=57.2s)]
*  danger to the country he pledged to lead and protect. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=59.52s)]
*  Above all, his selfishness is without parallel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  He has put his own interests ahead of Israel's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=64.58s)]
*  at every turn, unquote. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=67.44s)]
*  Do you think that Netanyahu is dragging this war out [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=69.92s)]
*  longer than it needs to be for his own political survival? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=73.48s)]
*  I think that's very clear by now that the way the war [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=79.62s)]
*  is going, which on one side Netanyahu is talking about [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=82.48s)]
*  a total victory and the need to press on to do [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=86.24s)]
*  the operation in Rakhach and the way that he's conditioning [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  a hostage agreement or a hostage release agreement [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=95.41999999999999s)]
*  for a temporary ceasefire with some kind of bigger [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=97.96s)]
*  military push, while at the same time we're seeing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=102.72s)]
*  on the ground that the military isn't carrying out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=104.91999999999999s)]
*  that push and they're scaling down with Israeli forces. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=107.88s)]
*  It looks like a recipe for a much longer war, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=111.16s)]
*  and the main reason for that happening is that Netanyahu [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=114.98s)]
*  feels that as long as this war is, as long as he can say [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=117.98s)]
*  that Israel's at war, it'll be much more difficult [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=121.54s)]
*  for his political opponents to demand an early election, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=124.26s)]
*  which will probably remove him. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=127.42s)]
*  So it's just a factual matter that Netanyahu's survival [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=129.66s)]
*  as prime minister depends on some anti-Arab zealots [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=133.46s)]
*  in his cabinet, Ben-Gabir and Smotrich primarily. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=139.02s)]
*  He needs their support to stay in power if he alienates [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=141.86s)]
*  them, they can leave and there'll be a new election, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=144.78s)]
*  he'll not have support to be prime minister. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=147.46s)]
*  How much do you think that's the reason that not enough [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=149.82s)]
*  humanitarian aid is getting into Gaza? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=152.98s)]
*  I don't think that's the main reason. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=157.9s)]
*  I think the reason that not enough humanitarian aid [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=159.38s)]
*  got into Gaza is a combination of reasons which partly [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=162.08s)]
*  is the trauma that Israelis were feeling in the aftermath [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  of October 7, partly it's the way that Israeli media [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=169.62s)]
*  was focused on the military campaign and didn't think [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=174.78s)]
*  that the humanitarian side of it was something that they, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=179.06s)]
*  as the army, needed to prioritize. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=182.46s)]
*  And yes, the third element I think is this political [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=185.58s)]
*  paralysis at the heart of Netanyahu's cabinet. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=190.1s)]
*  He can't make any major decision because he's scared [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=193.14s)]
*  of angering either the far right wing of his government [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=196.38s)]
*  without whom he doesn't have a majority [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=201.94s)]
*  or the pragmatic wing and of course the Biden administration. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=203.66s)]
*  That leads to indecision and what we're seeing now [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=207.98s)]
*  is that there needed to be some kind of proactive tape [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=211.82s)]
*  on the humanitarian front and that has been absent [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=215.26s)]
*  from Israel's decision making and Netanyahu [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=218.72s)]
*  is the manager responsible for that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=222.26s)]
*  So President Biden had a tough conversation with Netanyahu [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=224.26s)]
*  in which he said it was gonna be tough for the United States [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  to continue to support Israel if Gaza keeps going [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  the way it is, the campaign. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=233.46s)]
*  What do you think Netanyahu's gonna do? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=235.26000000000002s)]
*  A friend of Iraq, Ravid, is reporting that Biden said [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=241.10000000000002s)]
*  out and out, if he doesn't change it, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  it's gonna be tough to support you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=246.58s)]
*  Well, that's also what the White House readout said [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  and we saw already what Netanyahu did immediately [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=253.58s)]
*  after his very tough phone call with the president. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=256.98s)]
*  He rushed to the Israeli cabinet [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=262.02000000000004s)]
*  and immediately passed a decision to open up [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=264.34000000000003s)]
*  the main routes through Israel for supplies to Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=267.3s)]
*  This is something that for six months [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=270.62s)]
*  the Israeli government hasn't done. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=272.62s)]
*  Netanyahu did this literally within minutes [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=273.94s)]
*  after speaking to Biden so we can see [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  that this call had a major effect on Netanyahu. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=279.02000000000004s)]
*  But it's interesting that Netanyahu rushed to have the vote [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=284.1s)]
*  at the beginning of the cabinet meeting. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=286.82s)]
*  Now, votes usually take place after a debate is held. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=288.54s)]
*  In this case, Netanyahu was so scared [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=293.34s)]
*  of one of his far right ministers, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=295.94s)]
*  Avitamar Ben-Gur who had been delayed [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=297.7s)]
*  and wasn't yet at the cabinet meeting [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=299.78s)]
*  that he rushed to have the vote before Ben-Gur came. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=301.98s)]
*  So on the one hand, he hopes appease Biden [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=305.26s)]
*  by making those decisions and the other hand, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=309.38s)]
*  avoid a confrontation with one of his partners. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=311.7s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=315.22s)]
*  Anshul Pheffer, thank you so much. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=316.06s)]
*  Come back. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pFYovnPcs&t=317.22s)]
