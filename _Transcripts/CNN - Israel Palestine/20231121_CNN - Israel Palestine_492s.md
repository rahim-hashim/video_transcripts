# Israel and Hamas on brink of hostage deal
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc)
*  A major breakthrough on hostage negotiations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's war cabinet is meeting right now [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  on a deal with Hamas to free about 50 of the 237 people [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=6.08s)]
*  being held captive. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=11.32s)]
*  It's been 45 days since hostages, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=13.08s)]
*  mostly innocent civilians were taken by Hamas [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=15.52s)]
*  on the Jewish Sabbath. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=18.88s)]
*  Taken during an attack on Israel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=20.84s)]
*  when terrorists raped women and murdered families. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  More than a thousand people that day. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=26.36s)]
*  For each spared that fate and instead taken hostage, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  the unknown and the wait is excruciating [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=32.16s)]
*  for their families. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=35.0s)]
*  Now we are told an announcement of a deal [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=35.9s)]
*  that will allow some of those hostages to come home [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=38.92s)]
*  could be imminent. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=41.56s)]
*  President Biden addressed that moments ago. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=42.96s)]
*  We're now very close, very close. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  We could bring some of these hostages home very soon, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  but I don't wanna get into the details of things [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=54.36s)]
*  because nothing is done until it's done. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=57.04s)]
*  And we have more to say, we will, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=59.92s)]
*  but things are looking good. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=62.96s)]
*  CNN is covering the story from all angles. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=66.24s)]
*  Oren Lieberman is in Tel Aviv, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=68.36s)]
*  MJ Lee is here in Washington at the White House. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=70.24s)]
*  MJ, I wanna start with you. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=72.96s)]
*  That was a pretty remarkable moment [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=75.12s)]
*  from the president of the United States [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=79.0s)]
*  to lean that far into where he thinks [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=81.0s)]
*  that this negotiation is right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=84.7s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=87.42s)]
*  You heard the president saying [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=88.26s)]
*  that we are very close to a deal [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=89.38s)]
*  and that very much echoes what sources [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=91.86s)]
*  have been telling CNN all morning [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=93.86s)]
*  that the US, Israel and Hamas are on the cusp [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  of announcing this deal and it could come as early as today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=99.22s)]
*  I was in the room when the president made those remarks [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=102.58s)]
*  and I did try to ask him at the end [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=105.02000000000001s)]
*  how many Americans he believes [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=107.16s)]
*  may be among the 50 hostages initially released. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=109.18s)]
*  And he said, I'll have plenty of time [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=111.82000000000001s)]
*  to talk about the hostages, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  but not now, basically declining [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=115.54s)]
*  to go into any of the details. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=116.78s)]
*  And I'll let Oren speak to the details [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=118.72s)]
*  of sort of the contours of this potential deal. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  But at least for the Biden administration, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  this of course data has been an urgent priority [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=125.22s)]
*  trying to get these hostages out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  because they have said all along [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=129.94s)]
*  that they believe there are at least a handful [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=131.32s)]
*  of American citizens in the mix in Gaza being held by Hamas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=133.78s)]
*  And now what US officials are saying [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=138.38s)]
*  is that they are hopeful [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  that three-year-old American citizen, Abigail Adan, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=141.73999999999998s)]
*  will be among the 50 hostages that are initially released. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=145.01999999999998s)]
*  She is the youngest known American hostage. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  Her parents were killed by Hamas. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=150.5s)]
*  So this is a very tenuous situation, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  but hopefully we are, US officials are saying [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=154.64s)]
*  this three-year-old American toddler [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=157.61999999999998s)]
*  will be in the mix of the 50 hostages. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=159.26s)]
*  We've of course, seen US officials working around the clock [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=162.22s)]
*  to try to secure this deal over the last few weeks. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=165.82s)]
*  The president of course has been on the phone [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=168.26s)]
*  with prime minister Netanyahu, the mayor of Qatar, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=170.17999999999998s)]
*  president of Egypt and other top US officials [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=172.61999999999998s)]
*  have been traveling in the region as well. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=175.17999999999998s)]
*  But Dana, it's important to underscore [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  if this deal were to come to fruition, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=179.14s)]
*  this is not only significant [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=181.16s)]
*  because of the release of hostages, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=182.76s)]
*  but because this would mark the first sustained pause [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=184.77999999999997s)]
*  in fighting and the first major de-escalatory step [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  that Israel will be taking really since the war first began. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=192.16s)]
*  MJ, thank you so much for that reporting [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=196.33999999999997s)]
*  and let's get more specific about what sources [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=198.1s)]
*  are telling us this deal may include [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=201.22s)]
*  the release of 50 women and children [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=204.18s)]
*  and in exchange there would be a four or five day pause [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=206.82s)]
*  in fighting as MJ just alluded to. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=210.7s)]
*  Now three Palestinian prisoners would be swapped [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=213.18s)]
*  for each civilian Israeli hostage or other hostage [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=216.2s)]
*  being released by Hamas. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=221.14s)]
*  Israel would stop flying surveillance drones over Gaza [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=223.18s)]
*  for at least six hours each day. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=227.02s)]
*  Oren, I'm gonna go to you now about what is happening [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  in Israel as we speak, the government is meeting, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=234.02s)]
*  what are you hearing about how that meeting is going [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=237.06s)]
*  and whether or not they will approve this deal? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  So this is all part of a legal and political process [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=243.34s)]
*  that is required to approve such a deal [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=245.54000000000002s)]
*  and that is required for a critical part of this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=247.82000000000002s)]
*  and that is to approve the release [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=249.78s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners, women and children. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=251.58s)]
*  So the first part of that is the war cabinet is meeting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=254.34s)]
*  and that's a very small group of people [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=257.62s)]
*  including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=258.58s)]
*  that will lead straight into a meeting [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  of the security cabinet, again that's a slightly larger [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=262.62s)]
*  group and then the full cabinet itself, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  that is the government and it needs to be approved [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=267.82s)]
*  at each one of those stages for this deal to go through. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=269.86s)]
*  Now that's critical because two partners [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=273.26s)]
*  in Netanyahu's governing coalition, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=275.46s)]
*  two far right partners I should say, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=277.46s)]
*  have already put out statements saying [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=279.3s)]
*  they will oppose this deal and that could of course [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=280.62s)]
*  scuttle it and if they wanted to go to the extreme [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=283.9s)]
*  they could theoretically topple Netanyahu's government [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=285.94s)]
*  but having spoken to one of the families [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=288.78s)]
*  of the hostages a short time ago, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=290.42s)]
*  they say they received an assurance from one [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=292.3s)]
*  of the other critical members of Netanyahu's government [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=294.42s)]
*  that if this deal is put forward it will get approved [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=297.06s)]
*  and that gives them a critical bit of confidence [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=300.18s)]
*  that having gotten to this point where we see the process [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=302.74s)]
*  in Israel begin to approve a hostage deal in an exchange [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=305.82s)]
*  and an agreement with Hamas that would see them free, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  Israeli and other hostages potentially, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=312.1s)]
*  that it will get over the line [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=314.54s)]
*  and that's what they're looking to now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  And that's important because these families [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=317.94s)]
*  have heard the word imminent before [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=319.54s)]
*  and have heard reports and rumors [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  that something is about to happen [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=323.3s)]
*  but if you speak with them they believe [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=325.02000000000004s)]
*  there's something far more tangible here, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=326.82000000000005s)]
*  something far more palpable and real [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  even if they haven't gotten an official word [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=331.42s)]
*  from the government at this point. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=333.18s)]
*  Now these three votes and meetings [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=334.82000000000005s)]
*  that are expected tonight are not the end of the process. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=336.3s)]
*  There is then a 24 hour window in which there can be appeals [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=338.66s)]
*  that the Supreme Court filed against this. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=342.38s)]
*  That too will take its time as that runs its course [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=344.58s)]
*  but from the indications we're seeing here [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=347.46s)]
*  the government, Netanyahu, feeling confident [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=348.94s)]
*  as this moves forward through the evening [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=351.29999999999995s)]
*  and we will certainly keep you posted, Dana, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=353.06s)]
*  as it moves into the subsequent meetings. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=354.85999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so that's the process which is important. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=357.26s)]
*  The politics there obviously are critically important [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=359.46s)]
*  and now let's talk about the people, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=362.78s)]
*  the people who are being held. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=364.09999999999997s)]
*  Do we know anything about the condition of these hostages? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=365.85999999999996s)]
*  All of them but even specifically the women and children [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=370.18s)]
*  on that list of 50 who are hopefully going to be released. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=373.86s)]
*  The answer is we simply don't. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  We know so little about the nearly 240 hostages [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=381.98s)]
*  held in Gaza and that has been [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=385.22s)]
*  an incredible source of frustration. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=386.86s)]
*  In fact, the little information we do know [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=388.54s)]
*  has only come out from the Israeli military [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=390.82s)]
*  when it says it has found the bodies [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=392.58s)]
*  of two Israeli hostages killed in Gaza and brought them out. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=394.74s)]
*  There were several hostages released very early on [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=398.46000000000004s)]
*  but that was weeks ago, if not more than a month ago. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=400.82s)]
*  In terms of who is coming out, the 50 women and children, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=403.58000000000004s)]
*  we know at this point almost nothing except that little bit. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=406.90000000000003s)]
*  On the flip side of that, we also don't know anything [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=410.42s)]
*  about the 150 Palestinian women and children [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=413.66s)]
*  who are set to be released as part of this exchange. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=415.70000000000005s)]
*  So in terms of the details of how this plays out, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=418.46000000000004s)]
*  really the nitty gritty of this, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=421.74s)]
*  we are still waiting for that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=423.66s)]
*  and of course the families of the hostages [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=425.14s)]
*  are still waiting to find out [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=426.90000000000003s)]
*  if their loved ones are on that list. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=428.02000000000004s)]
*  Orin, thank you so much for that reporting [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=430.58000000000004s)]
*  and this potential breakthrough [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=432.66s)]
*  in these hostage negotiations comes [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=434.26s)]
*  a day after the families of hostages met in Israel [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=436.94s)]
*  with the war cabinet there, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=440.62s)]
*  emotional calls to bring the hostages home. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=442.7s)]
*  That's what happened in those meetings. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=445.66s)]
*  Now we heard similar emotion from one of the family members [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=447.14s)]
*  of a young girl that MJ was talking about, Abigail Adan. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  She's three years old, she's being held in Gaza. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=455.98s)]
*  This is her great aunt speaking to CNN this morning. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=459.54s)]
*  These people have been in the dark for 45 days. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  Abigail is a beautiful child who wants to run around [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=467.38s)]
*  and play soccer with her older brother and sister. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=470.3s)]
*  And she hasn't been able to run around in 45 days. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=472.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't know where she is, we don't know. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=476.5s)]
*  She should be home with her family [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=478.5s)]
*  and with her sister and brother and she isn't right now. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=480.5s)]
*  I'm not a politician, I'm not a diplomat. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=484.3s)]
*  I will believe it when I see them walk out, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=486.42s)]
*  be driven out and they are free. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6inrhxXGc&t=489.34000000000003s)]
