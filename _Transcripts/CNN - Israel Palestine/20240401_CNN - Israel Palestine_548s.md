# Iran accuses Israel of killing top commander in airstrike
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50)
*  We are tracking breaking news out of the Middle East, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=0.0s)]
*  an attack on Iran's consulate building in Syria. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=3.12s)]
*  Iran's ambassador was not hurt, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  but he told reporters in Damascus [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=8.96s)]
*  at least five people were killed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  and blamed Israeli warplanes for the strike. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Now, CNN cannot independently verify those claims. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Our Nick Robinson, though, is here [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=20.52s)]
*  and is following all the breaking news story on this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=22.16s)]
*  And, Nick, this is a significant target. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=25.0s)]
*  What more are you learning about this attack? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=27.0s)]
*  Well, the ambassador says he was an eyewitness to it [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  because the embassy is right next to the consular building. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=32.28s)]
*  The consular building destroyed. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=34.68s)]
*  He says at least five people were killed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  One of them, according to Iranian state media, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=39.28s)]
*  was Brigadier General Mohammed Reza Zahidi, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=41.64s)]
*  who is a very, very senior IRGC top military commander. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  He's commanded the IRGC Army ground forces before, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=49.72s)]
*  the air forces before, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=53.72s)]
*  and it is believed at this time [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=55.56s)]
*  that he is the most senior IRGC figure to be killed [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=57.16s)]
*  since the Quds Force commander, Qassem Soleimani, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=60.44s)]
*  was killed by the United States in a drone strike early 2020. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=63.0s)]
*  Take that with the fact [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  that this was a diplomatic building that was hit. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=69.4s)]
*  That hasn't happened before. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Now, the ambassador, Syrian media, Iranian media [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=73.64s)]
*  are blaming Israel, typically in these situations, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=77.6s)]
*  because there have been situations like this before [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=80.2s)]
*  where Israel has been blamed [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=82.68s)]
*  and has actually accepted responsibility [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=84.16s)]
*  for some strikes against Iranian targets inside of Syria. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=86.72s)]
*  Typically, the Israeli government at the moment [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=90.48s)]
*  is saying that we don't comment on what foreign media is saying, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=93.48s)]
*  the Iranians and the Syrian media. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=97.52s)]
*  So, this is a sort of a statement [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=99.92s)]
*  that we can expect Israel to give, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  but the indications are that this would be a target [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=106.08s)]
*  of high value to Israel, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=110.16s)]
*  and the ambassador said that it was, as you mentioned, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=112.72s)]
*  Israeli fighter jet F-35 that fired six missiles. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=116.24s)]
*  I mean, broadening this out, then, if it is Israel, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=119.56s)]
*  and we don't know at this stage, if it is Israel, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=122.6s)]
*  the implications here for a region that already is on the edge, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=126.0s)]
*  what will this mean? How will Iran react to this? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=131.32s)]
*  To set the scene from Israel's side for a moment, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=136.24s)]
*  they've been talking about the northern border, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=140.68s)]
*  their northern border, the southern border of Lebanon, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=144.0s)]
*  as being a place that needs a diplomatic solution [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=146.96s)]
*  in their tensions with Hezbollah that's a proxy of Iran, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  and they've been saying that window of opportunity [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  has been closing, and they've been saying [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=155.36s)]
*  that the window of opportunity is going to be closing soon, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=157.16s)]
*  and the discussion has been about mid-April. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=159.88s)]
*  So, Israel at the moment is really on the front foot [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=162.68s)]
*  in terms of wanting to have powerful strikes against Hezbollah. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  If they are responsible for this strike [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=173.72s)]
*  on such a significant Iranian target, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=176.12s)]
*  and the ambassador said that there would be a decisive response, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=179.08s)]
*  the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=182.68s)]
*  according to Iranian media, is saying that they have a right [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  to take a response. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  The Iranian Foreign Minister is saying [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  the international community should do something. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=190.88s)]
*  This potentially stokes up the tensions between Iran and Israel, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  and in that context, Israel would anticipate [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=199.84s)]
*  that that response could very likely come from Hezbollah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=203.64s)]
*  And if it did, then that would give Israel a rationale [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=207.72s)]
*  to strike Hezbollah harder, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=212.67999999999998s)]
*  and this is what the United States fears. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=214.72s)]
*  This is what European Union officials fear. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=216.88s)]
*  This is why Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting tomorrow [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=219.48s)]
*  with the French president in Paris, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=222.16s)]
*  and they will discuss this issue of Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Iran. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=224.6s)]
*  It's in this context. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=230.27999999999997s)]
*  The tensions on it are very, very high right now. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=231.44s)]
*  Yeah, the risk of escalation here clearly very high, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  and this is something, like you said, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=237.6s)]
*  that Secretary Blinken has been going to the region, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=238.8s)]
*  I don't know how it tripped, number five, six, I can't remember, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=240.8s)]
*  trying to keep a lid on this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=243.96s)]
*  So we're looking... I mean, what is the US saying at this juncture, then? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=246.8s)]
*  I haven't heard what they've said so far, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=250.44s)]
*  and it's not clear. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=254.6s)]
*  If Israel was to take responsibility for it, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=256.92s)]
*  then I think we could expect to hear something publicly [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=264.0s)]
*  If you go back to just after Christmas, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=266.72s)]
*  there was a senior IRGC figure, not anywhere near as senior as this one, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=268.24s)]
*  an adviser to Syrian forces, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=272.44s)]
*  who was killed by a strike in and around Damascus [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=275.76s)]
*  just after Christmas. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  Again, Israel at that time said they weren't responsible, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=281.92s)]
*  but later on, Israeli officials admitted [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  that they were responsible for that strike. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=287.24s)]
*  The United States is trying its best to de-escalate those tensions. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=291.32s)]
*  It wants the ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=295.08s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel's got 100,000 people [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=298.08s)]
*  who can't go home along the northern border [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=300.44s)]
*  because it's too dangerous, because of the escalation in tensions. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=302.52s)]
*  And there is some in the military and political establishment in Israel [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=305.44s)]
*  who believe that this is a necessary time [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=310.08s)]
*  to take out Hezbollah's military capability. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=312.64s)]
*  It's coming... [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=317.68s)]
*  Is this a spark to set off the Tinder box? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=319.84s)]
*  Everything we've seen so far, Israel has calculated... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=322.32s)]
*  And I was just looking at an interview I did [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=326.32s)]
*  with the former head of Israeli military intelligence [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=328.32s)]
*  a few months ago, and he said, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  so far everything Israel has done has been within a red line [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=333.0s)]
*  not to cause Iran to escalate, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=336.36s)]
*  because Iran knows it has a lot at stake at the moment. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=338.64s)]
*  Is this another calculation by Israel, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=342.32s)]
*  taking it right to the wire? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=346.16s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=348.64s)]
*  And what is Iran's response going to be? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=349.64s)]
*  It was a very big response when Qassem Soleimani was killed. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=352.36s)]
*  Let's start with a conversation about the breaking news. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=356.16s)]
*  We led the hour with the apparent strike [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=359.0s)]
*  on the Iranian consulate building in Damascus, Syria. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=362.96s)]
*  The Iranian ambassador pointing the finger at Israel. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=366.8s)]
*  Israel says it doesn't comment on foreign media reports. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=369.64s)]
*  What do you make of the attack [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=373.96s)]
*  and the likelihood that this was potentially the IDF? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=375.12s)]
*  Well, it seems that's the highest likelihood [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=379.28s)]
*  that it was the IDF. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=381.64s)]
*  Not a certainty. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  It's a fascinating and in some ways risky move. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=386.2s)]
*  You're going to now bet about how the Iranians will respond. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=391.84s)]
*  The Israelis until now have taken the position [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=397.68s)]
*  that they will go after Iranian commanders or anyone else [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  who they believe are masterminds behind the attacks [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=407.12s)]
*  on Israelis from Lebanon and all that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=411.15999999999997s)]
*  But the problem is here [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=415.88s)]
*  that they are still deeply engaged in Gaza. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  And the whole effort has been to keep this war [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  from spreading to the north. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=424.52s)]
*  And this may well give the Iranians an excuse to do that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  Until now, as you've heard from Natasha Bertrand, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=431.36s)]
*  we've seen something of a calming down [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=435.56s)]
*  and this could undo all of that [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=438.32s)]
*  and inflame the situation pretty quickly. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=441.2s)]
*  David, put that into context for us [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=443.96s)]
*  in the prism of where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=446.76s)]
*  is right now, because he is at a point of vulnerability [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=451.0s)]
*  as we've watched these protests escalate over recent days [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=454.48s)]
*  and especially into the weekend, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=457.8s)]
*  as we saw with Melissa Bell with tents being set up [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=460.16s)]
*  outside the Israeli parliament. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=463.2s)]
*  What is the significance of the timing here? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=465.56s)]
*  Well, there are two possibilities [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=470.0s)]
*  that come immediately to mind. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=472.4s)]
*  One is the timing was merely a military moment [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=473.6s)]
*  of opportunity where they knew where these commanders were [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=478.72s)]
*  and they had an open shot at them [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  and one where they thought they might be able [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=484.48s)]
*  to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=487.2s)]
*  Although right now we don't know [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=489.0s)]
*  what those casualties may have been. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=490.64s)]
*  The other is that Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=493.36s)]
*  sees the risk of an expanded war [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=496.56s)]
*  as politically beneficial potentially to him. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=500.2s)]
*  That his entire reason for staying in office [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=503.24s)]
*  has been to defend Israel [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=509.4s)]
*  in the wake of the October 7 attacks [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=511.92s)]
*  and of course the American concern [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=514.92s)]
*  is that he has done this in the hardest possible way, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=517.56s)]
*  in a way that has cost at least 30,000 lives so far [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=522.4799999999999s)]
*  and those protests that you saw [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=526.5999999999999s)]
*  marked sort of the end of that period of grace [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  that Netanyahu had where the Israelis sort of took the view [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=532.68s)]
*  that even if he was not their preferred leader, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=538.56s)]
*  he was their wartime leader [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=541.56s)]
*  and you're now seeing that fracture. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=543.3599999999999s)]
*  He may see some benefit in the war revving up. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX-_To2fh50&t=544.88s)]
