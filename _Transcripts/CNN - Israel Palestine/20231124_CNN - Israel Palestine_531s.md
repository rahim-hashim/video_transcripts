# Cheers erupt as Red Cross convoy passes through Rafah crossing
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4)
*  Just to speak to the significance, John, of what it means here in Israel, everywhere you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=0.0s)]
*  go, you see the flyers of these hostages, the ones that you see in the U.S. and London [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  and other countries. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=10.88s)]
*  And you can see there, that is the convoy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=12.6s)]
*  We don't know who's inside this convoy, but you can see, John, that convoy making its [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=14.8s)]
*  way through the Ra'afah crossing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=18.26s)]
*  That is the crossing between Gaza and Egypt right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=20.34s)]
*  You can hear cheers and horns honking. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=23.5s)]
*  Again, we're looking at pictures right now from the Ra'afah crossing of a convoy moving [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=27.5s)]
*  with beeping and honking. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=56.92s)]
*  It's a Red Cross convoy. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=58.2s)]
*  We cannot know for certain who is part of that convoy right now, if the hostages are [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=59.7s)]
*  part of it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=65.9s)]
*  But you did hear some honking, some celebration there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=66.9s)]
*  Unclear to me exactly where that celebration would be coming from, if it was the Red Cross [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=69.86s)]
*  convoy carrying those hostages. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  But we are seeing that activity at Ra'afah right here, which will be a key transit point, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=76.86s)]
*  Caitlin, for these hostages as they move through. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=81.5s)]
*  And you brought up another point here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=84.5s)]
*  One of the things that developments, the twists today is not only has a number of hostages [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=86.26s)]
*  been turned over from Hamas to the Red Cross, believed to be Israeli hostages, but several [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=92.66s)]
*  Thai hostages, people from Thailand who had been held, we understand they've been turned [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=98.1s)]
*  over as well. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=103.34s)]
*  And it's not completely clear if those two groups are traveling together or separate [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=104.34s)]
*  at this point, Caitlin. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=108.86s)]
*  Yeah, that is still something that we're trying to figure out. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=110.9s)]
*  This is a really fast moving process. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=114.16s)]
*  I mean, it's taking time for them to get from place to place. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=116.52s)]
*  But there are several different layers of government involved here, different governments [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=119.64s)]
*  that are involved in this process. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=123.36s)]
*  This had been something that as we were hearing as Israel and Hamas were getting closer to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=125.4s)]
*  this deal, which was being negotiated by Qatar, that there were also questions of other governments [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=129.2s)]
*  also negotiating for their foreign nationals who were being held by Hamas in Gaza to also [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=134.28s)]
*  be released. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=139.28s)]
*  A lot of these that we had heard of that had been taken into Gaza, the point of this and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=140.44s)]
*  what we were hearing as we were talking about this from the ideological perspective is a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=145.96s)]
*  lot of these were laborers who were at the kibbutzim. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=149.96s)]
*  And that is something that we heard when I went to Kibbutz Kisafim, they talked about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=152.84s)]
*  the laborers who had just been working there at that particular kibbutz and the fact that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=156.24s)]
*  they had also been taken hostage. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=161.56s)]
*  Some of these are people who they're not Jewish, they're not Israeli, yet they were also taken [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=163.88s)]
*  by Hamas into Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=167.76s)]
*  So that is something we're watching with the numbers here because that has been another [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=169.64s)]
*  critical part of this is that ultimately we're told it's 50 hostages that are being released. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=172.72s)]
*  We got this additional information just a short time ago from Egyptian officials that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=178.04s)]
*  these Thai nationals are also part of this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=182.76s)]
*  It is still a question of whether or not they are moving in this group together, whether [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=185.44s)]
*  all of them were in that convoy that we saw just pass through the Ra'afah crossing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=189.32s)]
*  Those are things that we'll have better clarity on once they've made it through. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=193.72s)]
*  We do know Israel expects to publish a list of who has made it into Israel once those [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=197.5s)]
*  hostages have made it here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=202.38s)]
*  They said they will not do so beforehand. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=203.54000000000002s)]
*  And so that is something that we're watching very closely. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=205.9s)]
*  I know CNN's international anchor, Becky Anderson, also tracking this closely. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  And Becky, you've been checking in with sources about the Thai nationals who are also being [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=212.34s)]
*  released by Hamas today. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  What else are you hearing about not just that, but also what we just saw happen, that convoy, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=218.78s)]
*  the Red Cross convoy passing through the Ra'afah crossing? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=224.02s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=228.26000000000002s)]
*  They've just left Gaza through that crossing and they will be making their way through [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=228.78s)]
*  that crossing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=233.62s)]
*  If you were doing that as a normal individual, it would take some time to get through that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=234.62s)]
*  crossing, but clearly that Red Cross convoy will move very quickly through that crossing [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=238.34s)]
*  and into Egypt. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=243.06s)]
*  As we understand it, this group of Israeli hostages are travelling in the same convoy [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  as these Thai nationals. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=250.22s)]
*  Their release was a separate and unconditional deal struck separately from the hostage deal [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=252.9s)]
*  Hamas-Israel that was baked into this wider humanitarian pause. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=263.34000000000003s)]
*  I did put this question about whether there was any separate tracks being negotiated by [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=268.86s)]
*  the Qatari mediators to the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs just yesterday. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  And he described this without answering the question specifically, he described this as [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=283.02s)]
*  a humanitarian effort. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=288.26s)]
*  So I think what we can understand from that is that the Thai minister who was here in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=291.38s)]
*  Doha a week or so ago had successfully worked with the Qatari mediation team with support [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=296.85999999999996s)]
*  from the Egyptians and others, including the United States of course, who's been very, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=304.58000000000004s)]
*  very, very involved in what has been going on between Israel and Hamas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  The Thais have been able to pull off a separate and unconditional deal to ensure that some [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=313.66s)]
*  of those Thai nationals who got caught up in this, workers at these kibbutzim, have [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=320.90000000000003s)]
*  also been released. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=328.06s)]
*  Now I think we have to be very clear that we are not absolutely sure of the numbers. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=329.5s)]
*  As we understood it, we were looking at 12 Thai nationals to be released into ICRC hands [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=335.26s)]
*  today and of course as we understood it, there will be 13 Israeli hostages released by Hamas [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=343.82s)]
*  as part of the main deal to be released into the hands of the ICRC. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=351.14s)]
*  I think what we need to do now is just wait to see who is in those convoys as they leave [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=355.38s)]
*  Egypt and then make their way into Israel, if indeed that is what the Thais are doing. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=363.78s)]
*  One, probably make a sort of a loose assumption that everybody will be travelling together [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=370.06s)]
*  now into Israel, into the hands of the IDF and we've been reporting all morning, haven't [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=374.74s)]
*  we, about the sensitivities with which the IDF will be dealing with those Israeli hostages [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=381.74s)]
*  specifically. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=387.74s)]
*  And we have to assume that they've got, we know that they've got specific instructions [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=390.22s)]
*  about how to deal with the kids who've been through this traumatic ordeal. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=394.26s)]
*  One can't even imagine it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=400.86s)]
*  I mean I'm a mum but you don't have to be a mum to try and imagine what it is that everybody's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=401.86s)]
*  been through, not least these little ones. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=408.5s)]
*  We don't know who's being released specifically. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=411.22s)]
*  The Thai authorities do know who is released today in their group but what we do know is [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=413.9s)]
*  that they are all travelling together in that convoy you've just seen go through the Rafah [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=420.9s)]
*  crossing from the Gaza side, travelling into the Egypt side and then into Israel. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=425.82s)]
*  That's as things stand at the moment. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=432.3s)]
*  We've been saying this all morning. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=434.14s)]
*  We're nearly two hours after what was the scheduled release of these hostages. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=435.65999999999997s)]
*  This has happened a lot quicker I think than perhaps many people had anticipated. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=441.54s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=447.94s)]
*  Obviously now we just have to wait to see what happens when we get some sort of eyesight [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=450.06s)]
*  on these hostages as they are delivered to the IDF and then obviously into the care of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=455.1s)]
*  psychologists, hospital workers, medics. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=462.6s)]
*  Some are going to need treatment. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=466.04s)]
*  We don't know whom. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=467.04s)]
*  We don't know how they are at this stage but this is at least just seeing those scenes [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  of that Red Cross convoy to cheers going through that border crossing just suggests where we [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=473.20000000000005s)]
*  are at. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=479.94s)]
*  This is the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since this conflict began. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=480.94s)]
*  Let's remember just a couple of weeks ago the UN Security Council finally got a resolution [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=485.0s)]
*  through asking, pushing for not just one but multiple humanitarian pauses. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=490.22s)]
*  At this stage we have this one. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=496.18s)]
*  It's four days plus an extension if Hamas are prepared to release more hostages. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=499.0s)]
*  But let's just see how this goes today, whether all 25 hostages are indeed in that convoy, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=504.62s)]
*  whether those numbers are sufficient to suggest that Hamas has fulfilled its obligations. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=511.02000000000004s)]
*  We don't know that because we can't see who's in those convoys but we do know that it was [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=518.22s)]
*  expected that there would be 13 Israeli hostages and 12 ties. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=522.82s)]
*  At this point it is not clear how many people are in those cars. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2lBOesLO4&t=527.1600000000001s)]
