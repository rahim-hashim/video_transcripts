# Drone footage shows strikes on what Israel says are more Hamas fighters
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo)
*  All right, we've got new details about a devastating strike in northern Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=0.0s)]
*  Health officials there say at least 87 people were killed and 40 injured in an Israeli airstrike. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=4.36s)]
*  Israel says it is also reviewing reports that a shell struck a team of water engineers working [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=10.24s)]
*  in southern Gaza, killing them. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=16.32s)]
*  In Lebanon, airstrikes are hitting Beirut's southern suburbs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=19.3s)]
*  That's according to Lebanon's state media. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=22.72s)]
*  And it comes shortly after Israel issued evacuation warnings and said it would target [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=25.16s)]
*  Hezbollah financial sites. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=29.72s)]
*  And the U.S. says it is investigating the leak of highly classified intelligence. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=32.0s)]
*  The information included intelligence on Israel's planned response to Iran's recent missile [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=37.08s)]
*  attack. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=42.56s)]
*  Let's bring in now Matthew Chance in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=43.56s)]
*  Matthew, what do we know about Israel's latest military operation in Gaza? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=45.84s)]
*  Well, it seems to be continuing because, as you just mentioned, over the course of today, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=51.64s)]
*  Palestinian health officials say that at least 87 people in the Gaza Strip have been [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=58.36s)]
*  killed in a single Israeli airstrike. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=63.84s)]
*  This is Israeli forces press deeper than they have done for a long time into Lebanon, the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=66.64s)]
*  neighboring country there, amid growing concerns that Israel is also poised to strike out at [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=73.32s)]
*  Iran in a conflict that seems to be intensifying and widening. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=80.68s)]
*  A quick warning, Fredrika, our report has some disturbing images. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=85.52s)]
*  Israeli forces patrolling the labyrinth of narrow streets in the central Gaza Strip. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=92.32s)]
*  These are the latest images from the Israeli military. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  What they say is their continued activity amid the devastation to dismantle Hamas. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=102.72s)]
*  To the south in Rafah, where the Hamas leader was recently killed, drone footage of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  strikes and what Israel says are more Hamas fighters and infrastructure. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=115.44s)]
*  While across Gaza, civilians are paying a heavy price. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=122.96s)]
*  At this hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip, an influx of casualties from a new [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=127.28s)]
*  Israeli strike at Bet Lahou. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=132.2s)]
*  Palestinian health officials say dozens of people, including women and children, were [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=134.68s)]
*  killed. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=140.44s)]
*  Among the shrouded bodies of her family, this woman calls her father to grieve their loss. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=142.44s)]
*  I swear, Dad, nobody is left, she sobs. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=148.76s)]
*  Israel says the casualty figures are exaggerated and that they operate against Hamas in a precise [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=155.76s)]
*  and targeted manner. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=161.8s)]
*  But eyewitnesses at the scene say the Israeli airstrikes felt like an earthquake. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=163.16s)]
*  It was just Wednesday when an Israeli drone captured the final moments of the Hamas leader [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  Yahya Sinwa's life. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=176.42s)]
*  His killing fuelling hopes of a hostage release, even a ceasefire in Gaza and beyond. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=178.42s)]
*  In fact, the region seems to be plunging further into chaos, with Israel stepping up strikes, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=184.48s)]
*  pressing deeper into neighbouring Lebanon, hitting what it says are strongholds of Iranian-backed [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=195.96s)]
*  Hezbollah, like here, the town of Nabatea in southern Lebanon. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=201.96s)]
*  Back in Israel, Hezbollah rockets have been striking the country's north, one drone even [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=208.0s)]
*  hitting near the Israeli Prime Minister's private house in the coastal town of Caesarea. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=213.2s)]
*  He called it an assassination attempt by agents of Iran, vowing to press ahead with military [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=218.28s)]
*  action. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  Iran denies involvement and Hezbollah has not claimed responsibility. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  We're going to win this war. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  So will Samin deter you? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=233.12s)]
*  No. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=235.12s)]
*  Amid fears of an even wider escalating war, all sides seem bent on pressing ahead. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=236.12s)]
*  Well, well, Fredericka, tonight, the Israeli military has issued warnings for people across [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=247.76s)]
*  southern Lebanon and the Lebanese capital Beirut to evacuate certain areas of that nation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=255.36s)]
*  This as reports on Lebanese media say that airstrikes have already been underway in the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=262.64s)]
*  Lebanese capital in Beirut, as this sort of conflict in the region seems to worsen by [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=269.2s)]
*  the hour. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=275.8s)]
*  All right, Matthew Chance. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=277.48s)]
*  Thank you so much in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=278.48s)]
*  All right, let's get more analysis now on these developments. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=280.48s)]
*  Bob Beir is a former CIA officer who served in Middle East countries. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=283.64s)]
*  Good to see you, Bob. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=288.56s)]
*  So first I want to ask you about this intelligence leak. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=289.56s)]
*  How does such highly classified information, intelligence like this, go public? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=293.24s)]
*  Well, right now it looks like it came out of somebody at the Pentagon, possibly at a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=300.12s)]
*  senior level, because what the Pentagon does not want to happen is have Israel, with the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=305.52s)]
*  situation, draw us into a war with Iran. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=311.76s)]
*  We're not prepared for it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=314.28s)]
*  But what it also tells me, Fred, is that we're very interested in what Netanyahu is going [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=316.44s)]
*  to do next, and he's not confiding us. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=322.88s)]
*  Because as a matter of course, we don't spy on Israel only when Israel, well, we don't [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=326.12s)]
*  But when Israel is out on its own making its own decisions and not consulting the White [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  House, that's why they've turned these assets loose on Israel to watch what they're doing. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=337.28s)]
*  One thing that has been signposted out loud is that Israel has been attacking what it [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  says are Hezbollah financial targets in Lebanon today. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=348.84s)]
*  Previously Israel has attacked Hezbollah leadership. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  And of course, we saw what just happened with the Hamas leadership as well. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=357.88s)]
*  But in your view, what is the goal here and what might happen on the other end after these [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=363.52s)]
*  financial targets are taken? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=369.76s)]
*  Well, Hezbollah does not have financial assets. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=374.24s)]
*  It uses banks in Lebanon. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=378.0s)]
*  It launders money. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=380.44s)]
*  They don't have any buildings that they necessarily bank in. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=382.44s)]
*  So I don't know what the Israelis are talking about. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  But I think what's happening, the Israelis have decided to go ahead and just degrade [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  Hezbollah until it looks like Gaza. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=392.08s)]
*  And that would mean taking out the southern suburbs and villages like Nabata, which Hezbollah [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=396.44s)]
*  is concentrated in. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=402.4s)]
*  And also, let's not forget they don't have all the tunnels that Hezbollah uses. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=404.28s)]
*  And the last thing that Israel needs right now is to declare a truce and pull its troops [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  back and then have Hezbollah fire more rockets into northern Israel. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=413.88s)]
*  It would be a catastrophe for Netanyahu. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=419.0s)]
*  And what do you anticipate now that Hamas's leader, Sinwar, has been taken out? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=423.12s)]
*  What does Hamas do? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=429.8s)]
*  How does it reorganize? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=431.68s)]
*  I mean, what is the infrastructure already in place for his eventual demise or potential [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  demise? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=439.68s)]
*  Well, look at it this way. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=442.24s)]
*  And this is reductive. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=443.71999999999997s)]
*  Hamas is a death cult. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=445.0s)]
*  It is heavily involved in suicide bombings. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=447.8s)]
*  And they're looking at Sinwar's death. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=451.12s)]
*  He's a martyr now. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=453.32s)]
*  And he's going to be looked up to. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=454.76s)]
*  And the command for Hamas is very flexible. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=456.36s)]
*  And it's devolved to secondary leaders, which are going to be much more difficult to get [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=459.91999999999996s)]
*  at. But the Israelis are still taking major losses in Gaza with their soldiers dying [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=464.84s)]
*  even commanders. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=472.12s)]
*  So this war is by no means over. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=473.12s)]
*  All right, Bob Bear, thanks so much. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XSZJb2rIIo&t=479.2s)]
