# ‘You decided to still drop a bomb’: Wolf presses IDF spokesman on Israeli airstrike on refugee camp
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM)
*  Back now to our breaking news here in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=0.0s)]
*  A massive explosion at the largest refugee camp in Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=3.0s)]
*  Joining us now is Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=8.0s)]
*  He's the international spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=10.0s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=14.0s)]
*  I want to ask you first about this massive blast that we all just saw, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=15.0s)]
*  we saw the video, at the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=19.0s)]
*  Is there anything more you could first of all tell us about how this explosion happened? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=23.0s)]
*  Hi Will, thanks for having me. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=29.0s)]
*  So we'll be coming out in the next hopefully hour with more data, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=31.0s)]
*  but I can update you now that there was a very senior Hamas commander in that area. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=35.0s)]
*  Sadly he was hiding again as they do behind the, within civilians. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=42.0s)]
*  And that's all I can say at this point. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=48.0s)]
*  We're looking into it and we'll be coming out with more data as we learn what happened there. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=50.0s)]
*  So can you confirm it was an Israeli attack that destroyed a big chunk of that Jabalia refugee camp? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=54.0s)]
*  Yes I can. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=62.0s)]
*  We were focused again on a target, a senior commander wolf. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=65.0s)]
*  And we'll be updating you with more data as the hour moves ahead. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=72.0s)]
*  But even if that Hamas commander was there amidst all those Palestinian refugees who were in that Jabalia refugee camp, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=78.0s)]
*  Israel still went ahead and dropped a bomb there attempting to kill this Hamas commander [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=86.0s)]
*  knowing that a lot of innocent civilians, men, women and children presumably would be killed. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=93.0s)]
*  Is that what I'm hearing? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=98.0s)]
*  That's not what you're hearing, Will. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=102.0s)]
*  We again were focused on this commander again who you'll get more data who this man was. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=103.0s)]
*  It killed many, many Israelis. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=108.0s)]
*  We're doing everything we can. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=111.0s)]
*  It's a very complicated battle space. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=113.0s)]
*  There could be infrastructure there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=116.0s)]
*  There could be tunnels there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=118.0s)]
*  We're still looking into it and we'll give you more data as the hour moves ahead. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=120.0s)]
*  But you know that there are a lot of refugees, a lot of innocent civilians. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=124.0s)]
*  Men, women and children in that refugee camp as well, right? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=128.0s)]
*  This is the tragedy of war, Wolf. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=133.0s)]
*  I mean, we, as you know, we've been saying for days, move south. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=135.0s)]
*  The villains are not involved with Hamas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=139.0s)]
*  Please move south. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=141.0s)]
*  I'm just trying to get a little bit more information. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=143.0s)]
*  You knew there were civilians there. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=145.0s)]
*  You knew there were refugees, all sorts of refugees. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=147.0s)]
*  But you decided to still drop a bomb on that refugee camp. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=150.0s)]
*  By the way, was he killed? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=154.0s)]
*  I can't confirm yet. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=157.0s)]
*  There will be more updated. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=159.0s)]
*  Yes, we know that he was killed. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=161.0s)]
*  About the civilians there, we're doing everything we can to minimize. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=163.0s)]
*  I'll say it again. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=167.0s)]
*  Sadly, they are hiding themselves within civilian population. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=169.0s)]
*  And again, we are doing this stage by stage. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=173.0s)]
*  And we're going to go after every single one of them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyqFFsRifFM&t=175.0s)]
