# Iran deploys naval destroyer to Red Sea
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8)
*  back as tensions soar in the Middle East, the Iranian Navy has deployed a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=0.0s)]
*  warship to the Red Sea. This movement comes just a few days after the U. S. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=3.52s)]
*  military sink three boats belonging to the Houthis. The Houthis are an Iranian [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  backed group from Yemen who've been targeting commercial vessels in the Red [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=11.96s)]
*  Sea. Let's bring in scene is Natasha Bertrand, who was following all of this [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=15.72s)]
*  for us from the Pentagon. So Natasha, how is the Pentagon responding to this? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=19.06s)]
*  Well, we're hell, a defense official tells us that they are monitoring the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=24.28s)]
*  situation closely, of course, because it comes amid all of the rising tensions [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=27.0s)]
*  in the Red Sea with the Houthis, which are an Iran backed group. Iran does [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=31.04s)]
*  provide support and intelligence to the Houthis, according to the White House. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=34.84s)]
*  And so the U. S. Is monitoring this very closely. However, it is important to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=39.16s)]
*  note that this is not the first time that Iran has deployed assets to the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=43.08s)]
*  Red Sea. They operate there pretty regularly. But the U. S. Of course, is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=46.44s)]
*  eyeing this because of the fact that they say that Iran has been providing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=51.28s)]
*  the Houthis with the kind of maritime intelligence that they need to select [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=55.44s)]
*  targets in the Red Sea as they hit commercial vessels there. There have been [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  over 100 attacks by these Iran backed Houthi militants on commercial vessels in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=65.56s)]
*  the Red Sea since really in the last month, month and a half. And so the uptick [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=69.84s)]
*  that we have seen is really remarkable, and it has really ensnared international [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=75.8s)]
*  shipping and commerce. The fact that Iran is now there just a day or two after [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=79.52s)]
*  the U. S. Shot, fired on a small boat that contained Houthi militants, sinking [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=84.28s)]
*  them and killing all of those Houthi militants on board could be seen as a [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=90.16s)]
*  sign that Iran is trying to present a show of force to the Americans, of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  course, who are operating in the area. Because if you'll recall, the U. S. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=98.36s)]
*  Also set up a multinational maritime task force to bolster security in the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=102.16s)]
*  Red Sea to try to prevent the Houthis from launching these attacks into [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=106.64s)]
*  escort vessels that are transiting the area so that they feel safe going up and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  through the Suez Canal so that international shipping can kind of get back on [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=115.76s)]
*  track here. So this is not right now being seen by the Pentagon as a direct [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=118.88s)]
*  threat to the U. S. Or any of its allies. Instead, they're watching it very [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=123.28s)]
*  closely. They do not necessarily think that Iran is going to conduct any kind [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=127.2s)]
*  of provocations here, but both sides obviously trying to send a message to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=131.12s)]
*  the other there that they're in the region. They can respond if and when they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=134.84s)]
*  deem it is necessary for help. Yeah, with huge implications that that region [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=138.4s)]
*  is that channels an area of 12% of global commerce travels through. So there's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  huge implications. Natasha Bertrand live force there at the Pentagon. Natasha, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=146.12s)]
*  thank you. Right. Joining us now seated military analyst, former NATO Supreme [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=149.76s)]
*  ally Commander General Wesley Clark General. This is the Iranian naval [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=154.08s)]
*  vessel that is being deployed. I can show you where it's going. It's going in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  the Red Sea, particularly down in this area right here, where there's been a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=161.46s)]
*  lot of activity the last several days. What is the presence of this Iranian [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=165.28s)]
*  vessel change? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=169.68s)]
*  So it is first of all, it's going to collect intelligence on U. S. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  activities in the area. It's going to serve as a deterrent or they believe [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=176.22s)]
*  it'll deter U. S. Actions against the hoodies. It will certainly inhibit us in [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  the sense of maneuvering. It's one more factor for us to consider. It raises [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=187.88s)]
*  tensions in the region. It shows Iran's hegemonial aspirations, demonstrates [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=194.72s)]
*  those and we'll just have to see where this goes. John, if the hoodies say, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=200.16s)]
*  okay, we got the Iranians here now, we're not gonna interfere with the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=205.76s)]
*  shipping. Fine. If the hoodies say now we got the Iranians here, we can do [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=208.36s)]
*  more to interdict the shipping. Iran has got to get its destroyer out of the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=213.52s)]
*  way as we protect the shipping. If that destroyer gets in the way, if it [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=218.88s)]
*  interferes with the shipping, if it supports the hoodies, then that is a [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=223.32s)]
*  challenge that will have to be met by the United States militarily. We'll have [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=227.48s)]
*  to watch this develop over the next several days. Let's talk about what's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=233.08s)]
*  happening in Ukraine because Russia has continued its air assault on this [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=235.96s)]
*  nation, including the capital of Kyiv, where we have seen destruction inside [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=240.6s)]
*  the capital city. Now it's believed that these attacks carried out with a [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=245.52s)]
*  number of different types of weapons. But one thing that the Russians are [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=248.72s)]
*  using are these airborne hypersonic missiles, which can deliver quite a [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=252.72s)]
*  blow certainly to civilian areas here. Talk to us about what these weapons and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=258.24s)]
*  the fact that Russia's using them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=263.8s)]
*  Well, first of all, these weapons can be shot down by patriot missiles, but the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=267.12s)]
*  Russians are using them in combination with other devices with ballistic [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=273.68s)]
*  missiles, with the Iranian supplied drones and other things. And they're [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=278.88s)]
*  coming at such a way from such directions as to basically overwhelm the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  Ukrainians defense management system. If you could get the Patriots in the right [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=287.79999999999995s)]
*  position, if you could cue them at the right time, they could stop these [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  missiles. But there aren't enough Patriots to handle all of the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=296.2s)]
*  requirements there. So this is an ongoing struggle. It's going to cause a [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  lot of pain and grief in Ukraine. And the United States in the West have [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=304.68s)]
*  got to provide the assets, more assets to enable Ukraine to handle this. And [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  that's very difficult because we're not producing and we don't have any excess [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=314.12s)]
*  patriot batteries right now. As long as we're talking about air power, we've [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=318.2s)]
*  learned now that since this latest round of air attacks from Russia began, the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=322.88s)]
*  polls has said in Poland, they've said that some of the missiles have flown [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=327.8s)]
*  over Polish airspace and now Poland says it's going to deploy some of its war [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=331.6s)]
*  planes over its country in its own defense. Is this posturing general? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=336.92s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=342.44s)]
*  I think it is posturing. I think it's a political move by the government in [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=345.1s)]
*  Warsaw. I don't think that the Russians intend to strike Poland. That's an [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=348.8s)]
*  entirely different scenario if they were to do that. But on the other hand, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  Poland is showing its concern and it's showing its concern not only to its [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=359.68s)]
*  domestic population, but to the other members of NATO and particularly to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=363.0s)]
*  Germany, France and the United States. It's part of Europe asking the United [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=367.59999999999997s)]
*  States to lead, do more, get reinforcement equipment to Ukraine, help [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=372.24s)]
*  Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine. It's all part of the diplomatic signaling [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=378.2s)]
*  going on right now. General Wesley Clark, as always, we appreciate your time. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=384.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us today. Happy New Year. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vta0CkM8xW8&t=388.48s)]
