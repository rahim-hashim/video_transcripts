# Deadly strike in Golan Heights raises fears of major escalation
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc)
*  We have breaking news tonight out of the Middle East where Israeli officials are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=0.0s)]
*  vowing to respond after a deadly strike in the Golan Heights. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=3.36s)]
*  Hey, hey, where are you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=11.88s)]
*  Responders saying at least 11 people were killed, including children. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=16.0s)]
*  When rockets fired from Lebanon hit a football field, we spoke with former [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=19.84s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Naphtali Bennett last hour. He said both Hezbollah and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Lebanon have effectively declared war on Israel, and Israel must now respond [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  accordingly. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=32.64s)]
*  The state of Lebanon essentially shot a rocket made in Iran. We know the name [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=35.56s)]
*  of the guy who shot it. His name is Ali Mahmoud. Yeah, these rockets were made [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=41.64s)]
*  in Iran, Iranian rockets, 50 kilograms of warhead. And it's time that we hit [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=48.0s)]
*  back. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=54.76s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond is on the ground for us where this strike hit. Jeremy, we see [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=56.36s)]
*  it behind you there. What are you hearing about all of this? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  You know, Jessica, we arrived on the scene and the mood is very, very heavy [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=66.72s)]
*  here. The Israeli military now says that 12 people were killed, and these are [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  all Children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 20. Several dozen [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=74.84s)]
*  more were injured, some of them in very serious condition at local hospitals. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=80.08s)]
*  But this is the deadliest incident since October 7th on civilians since the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=86.2s)]
*  beginning of this conflict, according to the Israeli military. And there are [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  now very real concerns that this could trigger a broader escalation in this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=96.6s)]
*  conflict. But before we get to that, I do want to bring in Tamar here, who [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  actually lives right across from this soccer field where this strike [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=106.16s)]
*  actually happened. Timur, you were nearby. You heard the sirens and you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=111.72s)]
*  actually saw this rocket hit right here. Yeah, I did. I live about 50 meters [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=117.56s)]
*  across from the playground on the fourth floor. So I have a direct view of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=123.36s)]
*  what happened here. I was just sitting on my desk. I got my notification. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=126.36s)]
*  Uh, and like two seconds later, maybe less. I heard the sirens. I just rushed [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=131.56s)]
*  to the window and not even 4 to 5 milliseconds. I opened the window. I was [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=136.48s)]
*  just looking straight. I saw it hit. I thought I saw the kids banicking, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=140.95999999999998s)]
*  running around, and that happened around 6 18 B.m. Something like that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  And I just rushed straight here. I got here like two minutes later, and that's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=150.76s)]
*  when I arrived to the scene and I had like a clear vision of the impact and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=155.64s)]
*  of the crater zone. So that's what I saw. And so you heard the warning [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=160.04s)]
*  sirens telling you that rockets were coming in, but it was just seconds. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=165.12s)]
*  No, there's not enough time. It's impossible if someone tells you otherwise. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=168.88s)]
*  It's impossible. Even the possible to get to 45 seconds. What can you do [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=171.68s)]
*  in 45 seconds? You can do nothing. It's like it's like I'm saying five [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=176.12s)]
*  seconds. Maybe I'm just it's too long. I think it's four seconds, maybe less [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=180.6s)]
*  like the sirens were still going on. That's when we heard I heard them back [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=185.48s)]
*  and I saw it and I saw the kids like, you know, you're talking about kids [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=188.76s)]
*  and children here. There's also they have reaction time. They're banicking. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=192.44s)]
*  They're going to stress. They need much more time than that. Even if you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  have five seconds and you're completely aware of the situation, you wouldn't [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=199.44s)]
*  have enough time to react to this. And so once you saw that rocket actually [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=202.92s)]
*  hit, you came here. You came to the scene. Yeah, I did. And what what did [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=208.44s)]
*  you see? Well, at first I saw the injured, injured Children running around. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=213.72s)]
*  I saw blood. They didn't respond to us. They were panicking. I saw a lot of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=218.84s)]
*  guys gathering here. Most of them didn't go down. I went down here and I [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=223.44s)]
*  saw a lot of things that are way too gruesome to mention out of respect for [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=228.8s)]
*  the families. And we tried to help, but it was beyond our help. There's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=232.4s)]
*  nothing we can do. There were injuries that you saw that were too gruesome, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=237.76s)]
*  too critical for any medical attention. There's nothing you can do. No, I'm not [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=242.4s)]
*  going to details, but there's nothing you can do. And this this area around [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=246.84s)]
*  six p.m. You know, it's summer. It must be summer. Kids are playing and we [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  kind of got used to the situation because it's been going on for a while. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=256.88s)]
*  We heard sirens all the time and we just we just got used to it. Nothing [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=260.04s)]
*  like this ever happened before. And tell me about this this community. I mean, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=263.8s)]
*  when we came out here, everyone is around. Everyone is still up. It's very [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  late at night. It's two in the morning, but everyone is still up. Everybody [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=271.2s)]
*  must feel very impacted. It's a very close knit community. Of course. I mean, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=274.64s)]
*  if you look around, everybody is helping trying to prepare for the ceremony for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=277.92s)]
*  the funeral tomorrow. And because everybody knows everybody and everybody [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=281.96s)]
*  is related to someone and we know the kids, we know the Children, all the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=285.64s)]
*  families is well connected. And so we stand together in good or in bad. And [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=288.84s)]
*  this is what's happening right now. It's a dark day for our town. It's a tragedy [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=294.28s)]
*  that hit us all. And this day will be remembered for generations to come. And [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  we'll go down in history. This is the most and not just in our town in the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=302.67999999999995s)]
*  whole of the country. As you said, it's the deadly attacks since the seventh of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=307.08s)]
*  October. And it happened in the in our small village. So what is what is the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=310.35999999999996s)]
*  feeling around here? Obviously, there's sadness. Is there anger as well with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=315.12s)]
*  that? And and and where is that anger being directed? I don't know where that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=319.23999999999995s)]
*  I mean, this anger is directed at the war in general, because, you know, in [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=324.76s)]
*  war, there is no one is winning. We're all losing. And the longer it goes on, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  the more we're gonna lose. And we're helpless. There's nothing not much that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  we can do. But I think there should be a response for what happened here today. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=336.04s)]
*  And we will not go quiet until we get a response for what happened here, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=340.0s)]
*  because these are our Children. These are our Children, you know, and what [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=343.16s)]
*  happened here is unforgettable. Like, just look at it. They're just kids [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=346.76s)]
*  playing soccer, playing football here. And they didn't even look at the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=350.56s)]
*  shelter. It's only like a few meters away. But I'm quite sure they didn't [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  have enough time to get there, even if they were. They acted like instantly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  There was not enough time. Yeah. Thank you so much, Tim. Or Jessica. I do. I [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=361.32s)]
*  do want to bring you closer to the scene here, because this is where you [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=365.12s)]
*  can see this crater right here is where that rocket actually struck. The [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=370.0s)]
*  Israeli military says that this was an Iranian made rocket that they say is [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=373.48s)]
*  only in Hasbulla's arsenal. Hasbulla has denied responsibility for this [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=377.56s)]
*  attack. But the Israeli military says that they are clear that this was [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=383.14s)]
*  Hasbulla that carried out this attack. They say that the rocket was fired [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=386.76s)]
*  from a village in southern Lebanon, and you can they say that this was an [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  Iranian war miss a rocket. Forgive me that had a 50 kilo warhead attached to [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=395.68s)]
*  it. You can also see behind here there are bicycles. This scene is [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=403.4s)]
*  effectively frozen in time from the moment when this strike happened. And [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=408.2s)]
*  just to bring you over to this, I'd have my cameraman Huff set pan around. You [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=413.47999999999996s)]
*  can see how close this is that cinder block building right there is a safe [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  space. That is where you rush to when you hear those sirens. And so just so [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=423.28s)]
*  devastating to see how close these Children were to that shelter. But [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=429.04s)]
*  obviously with just a few seconds to be able to try and rush into there once [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=433.56s)]
*  they heard those sirens was simply simply not enough. And the results now [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=438.48s)]
*  12 people, according to the Israeli military who are dead between the ages [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=443.66s)]
*  of 10 and 20 and an entire community here that is absolutely devastated. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=447.52000000000004s)]
*  Jessica, it is truly, truly devastating news, Jeremy and clearly just so [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=452.56s)]
*  heartbreaking for that whole community and these Children who are just playing [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=458.2s)]
*  soccer to be targeted in that way. We know that Prime Minister Prime [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=461.12s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was still in the U. S. When this happened, he [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=465.96s)]
*  cut his trip short. He's now headed back. We're told he'll be convening with [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=469.4s)]
*  his war cabinet upon his arrival. What are you hearing about how the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=473.24s)]
*  government might be responding to this? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=477.96s)]
*  Well, there was a very swift response from a number of government officials, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  all of them making very clear that there will be a response for this attack, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=486.56s)]
*  a very serious response at that. The Israeli prime minister himself said I [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  can say that the state of Israel will not be silent about this. We will not [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=494.76s)]
*  put this off the agenda. Benny Gantz, former member of the war cabinet, a [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=498.76s)]
*  member of the opposition. Now he came to much del Shams this evening to meet [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=503.52s)]
*  with community leaders, and he was also making very clear that not only will [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=507.79999999999995s)]
*  there be a response, but that the Israeli government will have his support [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=512.16s)]
*  as a member of the opposition for a decisive response in Lebanon. And that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=516.36s)]
*  really is now the big question. There have been fears not only in Israel, but [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  also in the U. S. Government that an incident like this, one with so many [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  casualties, notably civilian casualties and in this case, many of them being [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=530.1999999999999s)]
*  Children that an incident like this could potentially set off a very [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=535.48s)]
*  dangerous escalation, potentially lead to war. And that is certainly the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=539.3199999999999s)]
*  question now is whether or not the escalation, the response from Israel [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=544.88s)]
*  will be so severe that it could lead to that all out conflict with Hezbollah [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeDri9zeCgc&t=549.3199999999999s)]
