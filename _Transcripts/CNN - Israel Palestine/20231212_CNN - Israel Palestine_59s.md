# Bidenâ€™s warning to Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8)
*  these comments that we saw today from President Biden in speaking to donors are really the most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=0.0s)]
*  pointed that he has made against Netanyahu and the Netanyahu government since this war began. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=4.4s)]
*  He told these donors that Netanyahu needs to change, but that that is very difficult because [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=8.88s)]
*  of the far-right government that he is in control of. He went on to say that Israel is very quickly [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=14.32s)]
*  losing global support because of what he called the indiscriminate bombing that is taking place [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=20.16s)]
*  in Gaza. When talking about this most conservative government in Israel's history, as he called it, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=26.24s)]
*  he said that they don't want to see anything remotely approaching a two-state solution. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=34.0s)]
*  Instead, Wolf, he says that ministers within the Netanyahu government want to see retribution [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=39.44s)]
*  against all Palestinians. So of course, that is very, very strong language. The U.S. has repeatedly [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=44.0s)]
*  throughout this war continued to push for a two-state solution, but Wolf, we should note that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=50.56s)]
*  there's no indication that that is something that Netanyahu himself is interested in. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxBz2BwPo8&t=54.8s)]
