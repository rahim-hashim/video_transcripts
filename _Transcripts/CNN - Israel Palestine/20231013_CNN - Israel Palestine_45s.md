# Israel warns half of Gaza to evacuate
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ)
*  The order is to evacuate immediately, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and I would highly recommend that people adhere [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=1.96s)]
*  to that instruction. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=4.68s)]
*  We're looking at thousands of leaflets [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=5.68s)]
*  being dropped over Gaza City this morning. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=7.88s)]
*  Moss militants are urging people to defy the order [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=10.08s)]
*  and stay in their homes, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=12.8s)]
*  but we're seeing some Palestinians heeding the warning. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=13.68s)]
*  Families with small children heading south, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=16.4s)]
*  carrying whatever they can. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=18.44s)]
*  Is that possible for a million-plus people [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=20.04s)]
*  to immediately leave the north and go south? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=23.8s)]
*  The UN says it is not without catastrophic consequences. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=26.48s)]
*  It's not possible to do it in a reasonable amount of time. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=30.0s)]
*  In fact, the UN, the word they used is impossible. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=32.68s)]
*  You're talking about 1.1 million people [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=36.04s)]
*  going from the northern part, the area around Gaza City, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=39.52s)]
*  which is quite large, to the south. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGo5-FEKjkQ&t=42.52s)]
