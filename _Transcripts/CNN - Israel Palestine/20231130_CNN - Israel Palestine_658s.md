# NYT reporter says Israel knew Hamas's attack plan over a year ago
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo)
*  Talk about what your team learned about this blueprint [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=0.0s)]
*  and the length of time that Israel had to review these plans [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=3.2s)]
*  and why it wasn't listened to. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=6.4s)]
*  So somewhere around, along 2022, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=10.88s)]
*  Israeli intelligence was able to get the plan [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=14.6s)]
*  for the Hamas attack. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=18.12s)]
*  It code name, it was codenamed by Israeli intelligence, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=20.8s)]
*  the wall of Jericho, the Jericho wall. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=24.44s)]
*  And it details in many, many, many different details [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  how the attack is going to take place, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=32.08s)]
*  exactly as it took place more than a year after. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=34.64s)]
*  This could be an intelligence victory for Israel, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=39.04s)]
*  but Israeli analysts, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=45.04s)]
*  some of the seniors of Israeli intelligence [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  saw the plan as more of, they call it as a compass [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=52.16s)]
*  for the building of the forces, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=55.72s)]
*  where Hamas wants to be, but not where Hamas is. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=58.44s)]
*  So while having that plan, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=61.96s)]
*  they saw this as something that Hamas [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=64.4s)]
*  is far from being capable of doing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=67.08s)]
*  They believe that Hamas has, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=70.8s)]
*  doesn't have the ability to conduct such a massive operation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=74.52s)]
*  We are talking about, according to that plan, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=78.28s)]
*  to break the fence between Gaza and Israel [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=80.72s)]
*  in 60 different places. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=83.28s)]
*  Israel believed they could do that maybe in two places. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=86.16s)]
*  They'd called for the bombing and destruction [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=90.64s)]
*  of the cameras instantly, the same simultaneously, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  the beginning of the attack of the cameras, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=97.84s)]
*  the automatic guns, the communication centers, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=99.92s)]
*  and then the ramping of the division headquarters, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=103.0s)]
*  the Gaza division headquarters [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=106.64s)]
*  that is in charge of protecting the front. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=107.96s)]
*  The, in July of this year, so a year after, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=111.0s)]
*  an analyst that was reviewing intercepts [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=117.08000000000001s)]
*  about Hamas military exercises, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=121.12s)]
*  wrote a letter, an email, an exchange of email, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  encrypted email. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=128.32s)]
*  She comes from 8200, the Israeli NSA, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=129.96s)]
*  the equivalent to the American NSA, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=132.88s)]
*  and she described that drill, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=136.16s)]
*  and she said that she believes that Hamas [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=138.8s)]
*  is narrowing the gap between the wall of Jericho plan [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=142.0s)]
*  and its real capabilities. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=147.8s)]
*  And there was a pushback from senior, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=150.52s)]
*  more senior intelligence officer said, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=155.0s)]
*  that told her, this is an imaginary plan. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=157.8s)]
*  They cannot do that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=161.56s)]
*  And so here is the tragedy for Israeli intelligence [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=164.0s)]
*  for Israeli public. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=167.08s)]
*  Instead of positioning, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=170.24s)]
*  it's not just an intelligence debate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  If Israel, if the Israeli defense forces [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=175.88000000000002s)]
*  would adopt this plan as something that Hamas can do, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=178.44s)]
*  even without any connection to the intention of Hamas, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  the decision to execute, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  this is something that the analyst couldn't say. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  She did not push back on the Israeli wisdom at that time, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  meaning three, four months ago, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  that Hamas doesn't want to go to Olingwon. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=199.39999999999998s)]
*  But if Israeli defense establishment had the knowledge [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=202.56s)]
*  that Hamas is capable of launching such an attack, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=206.2s)]
*  that would put a total different size of forces [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=210.12s)]
*  on the border, the outcome could be very different. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=213.32s)]
*  Also, according to your reporting, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  this analyst, this woman analyst, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  saw an exercise that Hamas undertook, a trial run, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=223.28s)]
*  and raised red flags again, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  saying this looks very much like the wall of Jericho plan [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=232.0s)]
*  that we had discussed before. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=236.64s)]
*  And again, would seem to have been dismissed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=239.4s)]
*  Not just that, she even has, she says, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=243.44s)]
*  here's an interesting bit of information. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=246.24s)]
*  The same quote from the Quran, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=249.96s)]
*  Surah Al-Ma'idah, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=253.88s)]
*  that begins with which this detailed plan for action, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=255.52s)]
*  this detailed plan for attack starts with. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=260.40000000000003s)]
*  It's called for, this is something about Moses, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=263.36s)]
*  but it's about the surprise entry through a gate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  I think it's not a coincidence Hamas picked this up. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=271.92s)]
*  The people participating, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=274.76s)]
*  the Hamas gunmen participating in that drill [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=276.36s)]
*  were using the same quote. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=279.28s)]
*  The same quote is now part of the emblem of Hamas [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  used in all Hamas publications, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  statement and videos since the attack. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=287.64s)]
*  As you know, the Israeli government posted online [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=290.47999999999996s)]
*  on X last month, quote, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=293.08s)]
*  contrary to the false claims under no circumstances, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=294.47999999999996s)]
*  and at no stage was Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=297.11999999999995s)]
*  warned of Hamas's war intentions. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=299.23999999999995s)]
*  They went on to say at no point was a warning given [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=301.64s)]
*  to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Hamas's intention [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=303.88s)]
*  to start a war. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=306.08s)]
*  On the contrary, all the defense officials, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=307.2s)]
*  including the heads of the intelligence directorate [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=309.0s)]
*  and the Shin Bet, assessed that Hamas was deterred. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=311.12s)]
*  Do you know if the Prime Minister was in fact informed? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=314.8s)]
*  Because it sounds like from your reporting [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=317.72s)]
*  that this document was widely disseminated [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=319.28s)]
*  in intelligence and military circles. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=323.16s)]
*  Yeah, so we don't know if Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=326.44s)]
*  was presented with this document. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=333.0s)]
*  We do know, and this comes from previous reporting, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=335.4s)]
*  that he was warned again and again and again and again. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=339.08s)]
*  And in details, at least in four different letters [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=342.76s)]
*  throughout the last year, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=345.4s)]
*  that the members of the so-called axis of resistance, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, see Israeli weakness [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=352.88s)]
*  and they might decide to use what they believe [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=356.56s)]
*  a window of opportunity to attack. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=360.28s)]
*  This document was sent to many, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=363.08s)]
*  and I think this is a good point for further reporting [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=365.68s)]
*  about who saw and who decided to continue [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=368.88s)]
*  with this so-called conception, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=373.28s)]
*  the ability to believe that Hamas is contained. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  Ronan Bergman, it's incredible reporting, thank you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=378.96s)]
*  More now on the forces at play tonight, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=381.24s)]
*  joining us in is Alex Marquardt and Orin Lieberman, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=383.24s)]
*  also OXIOS reporter and CNN political [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=385.32s)]
*  and foreign policy analyst, Barack Ravid, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=387.24s)]
*  and CNN military analyst, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=389.44s)]
*  retired Army Lieutenant General Mark Hurling. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=390.64s)]
*  Barack, first of all, how damning is this report [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  for the Israeli government? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=395.08s)]
*  Well, I think this is part of a series of stories [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=398.64s)]
*  that appeared in the Israeli press [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=403.96s)]
*  over the last week or two weeks [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=405.8s)]
*  that what happens behind them is a fight [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=409.0s)]
*  between the Israeli intelligence community or parts of it, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=412.52s)]
*  especially the military intelligence, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=416.03999999999996s)]
*  and the political echelon. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=418.0s)]
*  With each side leaking stuff that are more comfortable to him [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=419.72s)]
*  when it comes to everything that happened in the year [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=424.92s)]
*  before the war. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=427.92s)]
*  And a lot of people in Israel think that the reason [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=429.16s)]
*  that now we hear about those documents [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=434.2s)]
*  is because it's very comfortable [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=437.88s)]
*  for Benjamin Netanyahu and his people, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=439.8s)]
*  and they're trying to put those things out [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=442.0s)]
*  in order to build a case for the inquiry committee [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=444.12s)]
*  that most likely is gonna be formed [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=447.8s)]
*  on the day after the war. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=449.6s)]
*  I mean, Barack, as you know, intelligence officials, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=451.44s)]
*  military officials have accepted responsibility. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=456.24s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has not in any form [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=459.68s)]
*  accepted any responsibility for the attack on October 7th. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=461.88s)]
*  He had very early on, right before the operation in Gaza, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=465.76s)]
*  he had tweeted out a criticism [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=472.0s)]
*  of the heads of the military and intelligence, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=474.08000000000004s)]
*  and then quickly withdrew that tweet [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=476.56s)]
*  and apologized for that. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=478.68s)]
*  But it certainly seems like this is something [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=481.6s)]
*  he wants out there. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=485.16s)]
*  No doubt, by the way, there was a huge intelligence failure. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=488.68s)]
*  It's not that it's not true. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=492.64s)]
*  There was a huge intelligence failure. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=494.6s)]
*  Just, you know, in one of the emails, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=496.36s)]
*  this analyst from Israel Signals Intelligence Agency, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=498.4s)]
*  8200, one of the headlines of one of her emails [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=501.96s)]
*  that was warning from this plan, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=506.0s)]
*  the headline was Death in the Kibbutz. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=508.32s)]
*  Okay, how symbolic is that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  Several months ago, Death in the Kibbutz, she wrote. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=514.36s)]
*  So there was a huge intelligence failure, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=517.56s)]
*  not at her level, but at the higher level [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=519.92s)]
*  of the people who are actually making the decisions [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=522.04s)]
*  and that their job is to actually warn [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=524.12s)]
*  the political echelon of what was going on. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=526.6s)]
*  But at the same time, Netanyahu did get a lot [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=528.92s)]
*  of other warnings that had to do also with [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=532.56s)]
*  the general situation where Israel's enemies [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=536.72s)]
*  were planning to gang up on it [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=539.24s)]
*  because of the domestic crisis over Netanyahu's [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=542.84s)]
*  judicial overall in the months before the war. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=546.84s)]
*  Alex, what do you make of this report? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=549.4s)]
*  How are US officials likely to react? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=551.4s)]
*  Well, Anderson, I really do think it goes to this theme [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=553.76s)]
*  that we've been reporting on for quite some time [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=556.32s)]
*  of the underestimation of what Hamas was capable of doing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  and certainly what they intended to do. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=561.76s)]
*  You and I have talked about intelligence reports [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=564.28s)]
*  and assessments both on the Israeli and the American side [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=566.88s)]
*  in the days leading up to October 7th [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=570.36s)]
*  that indicated that Hamas might do something. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=572.6s)]
*  Now, what that something was expected to be [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=576.24s)]
*  was what we had seen before in previous rounds of fighting [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=578.92s)]
*  that were frankly rather inconsequential for Israel. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=582.6s)]
*  And that would have been rockets being fired [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=585.12s)]
*  across the border, which then likely would have been [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=587.44s)]
*  intercepted by the Iron Dome, which is exactly [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=589.64s)]
*  what we're seeing on our screen right there. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=591.48s)]
*  But there was no sense that Hamas would be able [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=593.36s)]
*  to break through the fence and carry out [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=596.88s)]
*  the types of massacres that they did. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=599.04s)]
*  There is acknowledgement and public acknowledgement [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=602.16s)]
*  here in the US from intelligence officials [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=606.44s)]
*  and Biden administration officials [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  that this was purely an Israeli intelligence failure. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=610.52s)]
*  American intelligence officials are not taking [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=614.76s)]
*  any responsibility for this. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=616.76s)]
*  They are laying it at the feet of the intelligence apparatus [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=618.24s)]
*  and security apparatus in Israel. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  Essentially, the US has been so focused on China [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=624.36s)]
*  and on Russia and Ukraine that they just don't spend [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=627.24s)]
*  a lot of time thinking about Hamas [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=629.76s)]
*  and other Palestinian militant groups. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=632.64s)]
*  Now, will that change going forward? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=634.24s)]
*  That remains to be seen. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=635.84s)]
*  We've certainly seen US intelligence playing [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=636.76s)]
*  a much bigger role during this conflict with drones [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=638.76s)]
*  and other kinds of signals intelligence gathering. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=641.92s)]
*  But in their minds, this isn't an Israeli [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=644.36s)]
*  intelligence failure. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=646.4399999999999s)]
*  I think most will tell you that Netanyahu [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=648.28s)]
*  is not expected to survive this, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=650.52s)]
*  but there's also an expectation that the heads [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=651.84s)]
*  of the intelligence agencies will also roll. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu4Txxw9bOo&t=654.76s)]
