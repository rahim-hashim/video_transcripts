# IDF: Ground operation in Gaza expanding
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ)
*  What we have heard and seen perhaps indicates some activity on the ground. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And when I say activity, military activity and possibly troops in combat on the ground. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  We've seen a couple of flares coming up that typically soldiers would use in the battlefield [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=9.6s)]
*  to illuminate the area ahead of them to perhaps flush out the enemy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=14.9s)]
*  So we've seen a couple of those flares. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  We don't know specifically why they're being used here right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=21.2s)]
*  We've also heard heavy bursts of machine gunfire. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=24.3s)]
*  And sometimes when we hear the heavy machine gunfire, it is those very brief bursts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=27.3s)]
*  This was a very sustained firing of a heavy machine gun for a period of time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=31.3s)]
*  And we've heard that on a couple of occasions, which again, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=36.2s)]
*  perhaps indicates that troops are engaged in some level of firefight on the ground inside of Gaza right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=38.6s)]
*  We can't define it. We can't know it for sure. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=47.5s)]
*  What it is and the sounds and what we're seeing, it's all indicative of what the IDF has been speaking about. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kdjzeeymQ&t=50.0s)]
