# Israeli security cabinet approves ceasefire and hostage deal
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20)
*  The security cabinet approving the deal. What more can you tell us about what was worked out? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, the Israeli security cabinet did indeed just vote in favor of this agreement, voting that the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=8.96s)]
*  full government, meaning the full cabinet of the Israeli prime minister's government, vote to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=14.08s)]
*  approve this deal and put it in motion. And so we expect that that will be the next stage of the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=19.68s)]
*  process here. In the next hour or two, most likely, we will see the Israeli government likely [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=26.08s)]
*  approve this agreement. That will then set in motion this process where the Israeli Supreme [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  Court will hear petitions from Israelis who have been impacted or who are victims of the crimes of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=36.0s)]
*  these Palestinian prisoners who are set to be released. But that is largely a pro forma [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=43.76s)]
*  process. The Israeli prime minister has enormous leeway to release those prisoners in a deal such [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=50.16s)]
*  as this. And so it does appear, Fred, that everything is now on track for this ceasefire [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=55.92s)]
*  agreement to go into effect on Sunday. We don't know exactly what time the ceasefire will start [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=62.0s)]
*  or what time those first hostages, three female civilian hostages, we expect to be released on [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=68.88s)]
*  Sunday. We don't know exactly what time that will happen. But it does appear as if finally, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=76.72s)]
*  after quite a bit of uncertainty yesterday about the fate of this ceasefire agreement here in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=82.24s)]
*  Israel with a lot of political wrangling happening between the Israeli prime minister and his right [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  wing governing coalition partners, it does appear that at least now everything is back on track, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  that this ceasefire agreement is likely to be implemented on Sunday, and that we are on the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=98.56s)]
*  way for a six-week ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, one that will see the release of 33 hostages, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails, the entry of much-needed humanitarian [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=111.44s)]
*  aid. But it is important to note that until that moment, when that ceasefire goes into effect on [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=116.48s)]
*  Sunday, the war is very much still continuing in Gaza. The Israeli military is continuing to drop [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=122.32s)]
*  bombs and missiles inside of the Gaza Strip. People are continuing to be killed. More than [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  100 Palestinians have been killed since this ceasefire agreement was announced. And so that is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=132.56s)]
*  the tragedy of the moment. Even as we are on our way towards better days and towards a moment of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=139.92s)]
*  calm, six weeks of calm inside of the Gaza Strip, right now people are still dying, and the final [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  victims of this war until that ceasefire goes into place likely have not yet happened yet. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=153.76s)]
*  Fred? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=158.79999999999998s)]
*  And so, Jeremy, you mentioned there's been a lot of political wrangling for the prime minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  If this indeed goes through, gets the full support of the full body, the full cabinet, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=164.24s)]
*  does this fortify his position or does this still reveal vulnerabilities for him? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=171.44s)]
*  It certainly does still reveal vulnerabilities. Itamar Benkir, the national security minister, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=179.84s)]
*  held a press conference last night where he said that he will indeed resign from the government [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=184.96s)]
*  alongside altogether six seats that he and his party hold in the Israeli Knesset, the Israeli [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=189.92s)]
*  parliament, if this ceasefire agreement is approved. And that is indeed what is happening [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=195.83999999999997s)]
*  right now. That means that Prime Minister Netanyahu's margin of majority in the Knesset [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=201.27999999999997s)]
*  is going to drop from eight seats to just two seats of majority. And then there's the question [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=208.72s)]
*  still of what is the finance minister, Betzelal Smotrich, going to do. He and his party, who hold [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=215.36s)]
*  seven seats in the Knesset, have made clear that they will leave the government unless the prime [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=221.12s)]
*  minister provides them with assurances that Israel will go back to fighting the war in Gaza [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=228.24s)]
*  once the first phase of this agreement, meaning that six-week ceasefire, concludes. And we don't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=233.84s)]
*  yet know the extent of the assurances that the prime minister has provided Smotrich, whether in [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=239.44s)]
*  fact he will wait until the end of that six-week period to decide whether or not to leave the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=244.32s)]
*  government. But certainly, if the prime minister is listening to Smotrich and to his right-wing [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=249.44s)]
*  political allies, then that will short-circuit a process that is supposed to begin on the 16th day [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=255.04s)]
*  of the ceasefire, and that is negotiations to extend that ceasefire and to ultimately bring [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=260.88s)]
*  about a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. We know that that was the intention of the Biden [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=267.28s)]
*  administration to start this with a six-week ceasefire, but that ultimately the hope being [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=274.0s)]
*  that negotiations could ultimately lead to a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and an end [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=279.12s)]
*  to the war as we know it today. That is very, very much uncertain at this stage given the political [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=284.16s)]
*  dynamics here in Israel. All right, Jeremy Dimon, thank you so, so much. So once again, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=290.96s)]
*  the deal has been approved by the security cabinet in Israel. Now it goes to the full [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=296.72s)]
*  cabinet for a vote. We do expect them to meet later on this hour, and we're going to have much [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=301.52s)]
*  more on this later on in our program. All right, both President Biden and President-elect Trump [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=306.4s)]
*  are taking credit for this ceasefire deal. Take a listen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=312.32s)]
*  I told them what I was doing, what I thought could happen. But what we did, we brought in the people [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=318.0s)]
*  or his, going to be his national security people. We brought them in closer to tell them what was [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  happening as we hand this off. We're so ungracious of Biden to say, oh, he did it. He didn't do [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=330.0s)]
*  anything. If I didn't do this, if we didn't get involved, the hostages would never be out. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=334.64s)]
*  They would have never come out. All right, let's bring in Margaret Taleb, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=339.36s)]
*  a senior contributor for Axio. She's also the director of Institute for Democracy, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=344.16s)]
*  Journalism and Citizenship at Syracuse University and has joined us now from Washington, D.C. Great [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=348.96s)]
*  to see you. So, all right, so at least the Israeli Security Council has agreed on this deal. And now [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=353.44s)]
*  we're looking at this out loud kind of clarification of who helped get the deal this far, Biden or [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=360.48s)]
*  Trump. Biden did say that this deal was one that he offered last May. Trump's envoy was at the table. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=366.4s)]
*  We heard Biden say they invited them to help collaborate. So, I mean, I guess it's safe to say [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=374.88s)]
*  this is a unique transitional move. Is it important, you know, who kind of gets the upper hand on credit? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=382.4s)]
*  If you are a hostage and you are going to get your freedom back, it matters zero percent. If you are [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden or Donald Trump, it apparently matters a lot. And so I think, you know, Fred, what we're [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=400.56s)]
*  seeing here is sort of maybe not the best of politics, but the way politics should work, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=404.64s)]
*  which is that public servants in both parties come together to get something over the finish [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=409.68s)]
*  line. And that's what we've seen with Brett McGurk, who is President Biden's longtime negotiator in the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=415.36s)]
*  region. And with Steve Whitkoff, he's a real estate developer, deeply involved in Donald Trump's [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=422.0s)]
*  inaugural, but also has been tapped as President-elect Trump's incoming envoy for the Middle East. And we [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  saw McGurk and Whitkoff kind of divide and conquer, take different meetings, McGurk sticking with the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=435.2s)]
*  parameters of the deal that the Biden administration had been laying out and developing for months, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=441.2s)]
*  and Whitkoff using his and Donald Trump's relationship with Bibi Netanyahu to be in the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=445.92s)]
*  room while McGurk was on the phone. OK, that's all fine. And guess what? It seems to have worked. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=451.84s)]
*  But Trump saying he should get all the credit, Biden bristling over that, then Trump bristling [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=458.64s)]
*  because Biden bristled. That's all politics. It's a lot of politics. And it's happening at this moment [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=464.72s)]
*  of transition. We were talking a moment ago about the politics for Netanyahu in Israel, but in the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  United States, obviously, this is a big political moment, the inauguration of Donald Trump on Monday. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  And there are some echoes. It's definitely not an exact parallel, but some echoes of that transition [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  from Carter to Reagan. Oh, yeah, I can't help but think of that. Yeah. And the end of the Iran [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=490.16s)]
*  hostage crisis. And it was a little bit different in that case. But again, you know, it's clear [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=495.44s)]
*  both presidents would like to take some credit for this. And I think the truth is that it's not [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  clear whether this deal would have gotten done on this timetable, if not for the timing of the start [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=507.92s)]
*  of Trump's presidency. But it's also true that Biden's team absolutely spent months working on [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=517.2s)]
*  the details of this. And more broadly, it's true that this is not a United States war. This is a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=524.72s)]
*  war between two other nations or governing groups. And there are many other factors at play that made [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  a deal elusive and that are putting pressure for the deal now. So it's sort of typical U.S. political [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  egotism to make it seem like it's all about these two presidents and either one of them can claim [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=546.8s)]
*  the mantle. But the bottom line is in a few days, this is going to be Donald Trump's situation, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=551.28s)]
*  the U.S.'s situation under the Trump administration to manage. And President Biden will be former [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=557.92s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyaJfl08w20&t=564.4799999999999s)]
