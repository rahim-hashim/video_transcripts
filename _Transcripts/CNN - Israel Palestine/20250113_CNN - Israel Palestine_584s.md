**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU)
*  According to a Hamas official, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=0.0s)]
*  a ceasefire and hostage release [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=1.76s)]
*  steer in Gaza is quote very close, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  but sticking points remain. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=6.12s)]
*  Talks are ongoing in Qatar. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=8.28s)]
*  President Biden and Israeli Prime [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=9.8s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  been discussing the negotiations [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=12.6s)]
*  by phone that happened on Sunday, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=13.92s)]
*  their first publicly confirmed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=15.84s)]
*  conversation since October. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=17.44s)]
*  CNN's Jeremy Diamond live for us [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  in Jerusalem this morning. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=20.96s)]
*  Jeremy, what can you tell us about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=22.96s)]
*  the state of these talks and why [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=24.84s)]
*  they seem to be accelerating here? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=27.0s)]
*  Well Casey, it's clear that these [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=30.12s)]
*  parties are nearing the final [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=31.8s)]
*  stages of negotiations for a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=33.08s)]
*  comprehensive ceasefire and hostage [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=34.56s)]
*  deal, but the question still remains [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=35.84s)]
*  as to whether or not they will get [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=37.6s)]
*  this deal across the finish line. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=39.8s)]
*  A Hamas official telling us that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=41.44s)]
*  several sticking points still [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=43.16s)]
*  remain in these talks, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=44.32s)]
*  including over a proposed Israeli [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  buffer zone inside the Gaza Strip, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=47.08s)]
*  where Israeli troops would remain [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=48.96s)]
*  and details concerning the release [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners among several [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=52.68s)]
*  other sticking points as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=54.64s)]
*  But over the weekend we did see [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=56.32s)]
*  some really concrete movement in [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=58.72s)]
*  the right direction towards a deal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  First of all, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=62.92s)]
*  with the Israeli Prime Minister [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=63.88s)]
*  agreeing to dispatch the Mossad [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=65.44s)]
*  director David Barnea, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=67.16s)]
*  who has led the Israeli negotiating [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=68.36s)]
*  team at key junctures in these talks [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=70.28s)]
*  in the past, he was only supposed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=72.68s)]
*  to travel to Doha, Qatar. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=74.88s)]
*  If indeed there had been significant [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  progress, so that was the first point. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=78.56s)]
*  We also saw President-elect Trump's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=80.84s)]
*  incoming special envoy for the Middle [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=82.68s)]
*  East meeting with the Israeli [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  prime minister conveying very clearly [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  not only the Biden administration's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=88.6s)]
*  pressure to get a deal before January 20th, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=90.64s)]
*  but the incoming Trump administration's [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=93.0s)]
*  position agreeing with exactly that, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=95.0s)]
*  trying to get a deal before [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=97.8s)]
*  President-elect Trump is indeed [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=99.44s)]
*  inaugurated one week from today. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=101.64s)]
*  And now we are seeing all of these [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=104.6s)]
*  parties kind of rowing in the same [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=106.96s)]
*  direction trying to get a deal in Doha, Qatar. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=108.36s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that a deal is [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=111.32s)]
*  assured. All of the sources that I [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=113.12s)]
*  have been speaking to today have made [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=115.4s)]
*  clear that while things are very, very [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=117.28s)]
*  close here, they simply cannot guarantee [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  an outcome at this point. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  And part of that stems from uncertainty [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=123.28s)]
*  over whether or not Hamas and Israel [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  will have the political will to get a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=127.76s)]
*  deal across the table. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  And of course, here in Israel, there is [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=131.24s)]
*  this question of politics still being [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=133.72s)]
*  at play. The Israeli prime minister over [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=135.84s)]
*  the weekend meeting last night, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=137.56s)]
*  in fact, with Betulal Smotrich, that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=139.8s)]
*  far right finance minister who in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  past has threatened to pull the rug out [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=143.72s)]
*  from underneath this coalition [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=145.88s)]
*  government if indeed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=147.68s)]
*  the Israeli prime minister reaches out [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=149.92s)]
*  and agrees to a deal. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=151.8s)]
*  Today, in less than 24 hours [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=153.8s)]
*  after Smotrich met with Netanyahu, he [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=156.4s)]
*  took to Twitter to lambast [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=158.56s)]
*  this draft agreement that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=160.96s)]
*  appears to be nearing potential conclusion, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=163.88s)]
*  calling this deal on the table a, quote, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=167.12s)]
*  catastrophe, describing it as a surrender [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=169.32s)]
*  deal and urging the Israeli government [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=172.6s)]
*  to continue fighting in Gaza until [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=174.96s)]
*  Hamas fully surrenders [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=177.16s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=179.72s)]
*  So a lot still at play here, Casey, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=181.44s)]
*  certainly some positive momentum, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=183.76s)]
*  but uncertainty still remaining as always. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  And of course, looming over all of it, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=188.32s)]
*  the inauguration of President-elect [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=190.08s)]
*  Donald Trump set for a week [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=192.32s)]
*  from today. Jeremy Dimon, thanks very much [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=194.44s)]
*  for that report. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  President Biden will deliver what is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=197.4s)]
*  expected to be his final foreign policy [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=199.12s)]
*  speech as president. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=201.24s)]
*  A senior administration official says [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=202.76000000000002s)]
*  the president will argue he is giving [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=204.36s)]
*  President-elect Donald Trump a stronger [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=206.16s)]
*  hand than he inherited. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=208.08s)]
*  With us now is Principal Deputy National [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=210.56s)]
*  Security Advisor John Finer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  John, thanks so much for being with us. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=214.0s)]
*  Before I get to this speech, I do want to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  ask you about the negotiations [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=216.68s)]
*  for a hostage and ceasefire deal [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=218.96s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=220.8s)]
*  There are officials with Hamas saying [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=222.28s)]
*  they're close. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  So what's the status this morning? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=225.36s)]
*  So while this has fallen out of the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=226.76s)]
*  headlines a bit, the United States has [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=228.48s)]
*  remained deeply engaged in trying to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=230.48s)]
*  seek a deal that would first and foremost [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  bring the hostages home, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=234.92s)]
*  but also halt the fighting, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  enable massive influx of humanitarian [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=238.56s)]
*  assistance to Gaza. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=240.76s)]
*  We have been focused on that deal for months, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=242.04s)]
*  including day in, day out. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=244.48s)]
*  In recent weeks, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=246.56s)]
*  there has been significant progress made. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=247.95999999999998s)]
*  I am not going to sit here and make [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=249.88s)]
*  predictions. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=251.48s)]
*  This has been a long time coming. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=252.04s)]
*  We've been working with the United States [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=255.72s)]
*  We think a deal has been on the table [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=256.72s)]
*  that the parties should be able to agree [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=259.0s)]
*  to for quite some time. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=260.92s)]
*  Hamas up till now has been resistant [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=262.12s)]
*  and reluctant to actually take that deal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=264.88s)]
*  Some of the gaps have narrowed and we [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=267.52s)]
*  very much hope that this does come [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=269.6s)]
*  together and we're going to stay on top [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=270.88s)]
*  of it, but I'm not going to sit here and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=272.24s)]
*  predict exactly when it or where it'll [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=273.36s)]
*  come together. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=276.04s)]
*  No predictions, but are these talks in a [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=276.84s)]
*  different place today than they were a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=278.84s)]
*  few days ago? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=281.28s)]
*  Fundamentally, we believe there is progress [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=282.88s)]
*  being made. There is a deal on the table [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=284.88s)]
*  that Hamas should accept that could do [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=286.88s)]
*  all the things I just laid out again. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=288.88s)]
*  Bring the hostages home, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=290.88s)]

*  increase humanitarian assistance, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=293.16s)]
*  and that some of the outstanding issues [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=294.16s)]
*  that were present in recent weeks have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=296.16s)]
*  been resolved or narrowed and we will see [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=298.16s)]
*  what happens over the course of the coming [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=300.16s)]
*  days. The flip side of that CNN does have [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=302.16s)]
*  some reporting from someone familiar [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=304.16s)]
*  with these talks who says that the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=306.16s)]
*  incentive fee for the humanitarian [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=308.16s)]
*  assistance is Trump. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  Our reporting is that Netanyahu wants to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  get this done because of Trump wants to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  curry favor with Donald Trump. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  How accurate is that assessment? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=317.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, to be honest, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  we're not focused on the politics of this. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  We are actually gratified by the fact [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  that everybody who is speaking out on [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  this topic is saying that they want to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  deal in the near term. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  Fundamentally, that's our policy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  We're not going to be able to do that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  We're not going to be able to do that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  We're not going to be able to do that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  Fundamentally, that's our position. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=339.4s)]
*  And that's a good thing. We believe the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=341.4s)]
*  sooner that this could happen, the better. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=343.4s)]
*  First and foremost, because these hostages [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=345.4s)]
*  have been in a situation of just [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=347.4s)]
*  extreme peril now for well over a year. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=349.4s)]
*  And it's overdue for them to come home [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=351.4s)]
*  and be reunited with their families. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=353.4s)]
*  It is overdue for the fighting in Gaza [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=355.4s)]
*  to be halted. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=357.4s)]
*  And the people there who are facing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=359.4s)]
*  just an egregious humanitarian situation [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=361.4s)]
*  to get more relief. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=363.4s)]
*  This has been our position for quite some time [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=365.4s)]
*  and we are not focused on exactly [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=367.52s)]
*  who or why this may be coming together. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=369.52s)]
*  We just want to make sure that it does come [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=371.52s)]
*  together if we can bring that about. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=373.52s)]
*  Talk to us about the speech today [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=375.52s)]
*  from President Biden. What is the chief message? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=377.52s)]
*  Well, I think you'll hear the president [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=382.52s)]
*  say that through the work of this [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=384.52s)]
*  administration, the United States is now [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=386.52s)]
*  stronger at home than we were [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=388.52s)]
*  when he took office. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=390.52s)]
*  Stronger economically, a stronger industrial base, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=392.52s)]
*  a greater lead over the rest of the world [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=394.52s)]
*  in the development of the sensitive [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=396.64s)]
*  technologies that will define the future [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=398.64s)]
*  of the global economy and of our national [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=400.64s)]
*  security. And that's because of the investments [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=402.64s)]
*  the president and frankly the congress made [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=404.64s)]
*  early in this administration [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=406.64s)]
*  to strengthen our hand. Second, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=408.64s)]
*  he will say that we inherited, in addition to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=410.64s)]
*  a flagging economy, relationships [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=412.64s)]
*  around the world that were in tatters [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=414.64s)]
*  and that we went about not only repairing those [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=416.64s)]
*  relationships but enhancing them to [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=418.64s)]
*  historic levels, particularly in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=420.64s)]
*  strategically consequential parts of the world [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=422.64s)]
*  like the Indo-Pacific and like [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=424.76s)]
*  Europe. And so when these crises [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=426.76s)]
*  came that get all the attention [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=428.76s)]
*  in foreign affairs, obviously the Russian [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=430.76s)]
*  invasion of Ukraine, which was unconscionable, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=432.76s)]
*  the Hamas attack on [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=434.76s)]
*  Israel, which was outrageous, the United States [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=436.76s)]
*  was able, with our partners and allies, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=438.76s)]
*  to address those crises from [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=440.76s)]
*  a position of much greater strength. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=442.76s)]
*  And as a result, our adversaries [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=444.76s)]
*  in those crises, the Russians [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=446.76s)]
*  and the Iranians first and foremost, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=448.76s)]
*  are on the back foot and weaker than they were [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=450.76s)]
*  when this president took office. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=452.88s)]
*  The Chinese, who the United States [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=454.88s)]
*  has declared as our key strategic [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=456.88s)]
*  competitor, people were saying [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=458.88s)]
*  that they were ascendant when President Biden took office. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=460.88s)]
*  They would surpass the U.S. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=462.88s)]
*  economically, that they would outpace us [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=464.88s)]
*  technologically. Nobody is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=466.88s)]
*  saying those things with the same degree of [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=468.88s)]
*  confidence anymore if they're saying them at all, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=470.88s)]
*  in part because the performance of this [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=472.88s)]
*  administration led by the president. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=474.88s)]
*  And so we believe that he is leaving a very [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=476.88s)]
*  strong hand, as you say, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=478.88s)]
*  to our successors, a strong hand in Europe, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=481.0s)]
*  a strong hand in the Indo-Pacific, a strong [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=483.0s)]
*  hand in the Middle East, and it will be up [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=485.0s)]
*  to them to take that work forward. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=487.0s)]
*  One of the things you mentioned was [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=489.0s)]
*  NATO, a stronger [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=491.0s)]
*  NATO. What are you [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=493.0s)]
*  hearing from your counterparts in Europe [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=495.0s)]
*  about how they feel [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=497.0s)]
*  the U.S. commitment will be to NATO [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=499.0s)]
*  in the months ahead? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=501.0s)]
*  Well, I'll let them speak for their own [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=505.0s)]
*  predictions, their own relationships. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=507.0s)]
*  But I think one of the things that is undeniable [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=509.12s)]
*  is that when this administration [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=511.12s)]
*  took office, if you had asked [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=513.12s)]
*  analysts, experts on NATO, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=515.12s)]
*  if there is a major security crisis [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=517.12s)]
*  in Europe, how well is the alliance [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=519.12s)]
*  likely to hold together? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=521.12s)]
*  Will it end up more divided or strengthened [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=523.12s)]
*  and unified as a result of that [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=525.12s)]
*  crisis? I think you would have had predictions all [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=527.12s)]
*  over the map. So the fact that when [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=529.12s)]
*  the crisis came, when Russia invaded Ukraine [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=531.12s)]
*  in an unprecedented way, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=533.12s)]
*  which, by the way, we predicted when around the world [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=535.12s)]
*  saying was going to happen, when NATO [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=537.24s)]
*  emerged not only larger because of the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=539.24s)]
*  addition of Finland and Sweden, which [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=541.24s)]
*  gives an extra thousand miles to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=543.24s)]
*  NATO's border with Russia that Russia has to worry [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=545.24s)]
*  about, but also stronger [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=547.24s)]
*  with many more countries, almost three times [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=549.24s)]
*  as many countries spending at least 2% [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=551.24s)]
*  of their GDP on defense, and [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=553.24s)]
*  also more unified despite [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=555.24s)]
*  this incredibly divisive action that Russia [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=557.24s)]
*  took. That came about because of hard [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=559.24s)]
*  work and frankly because of leadership [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=561.24s)]
*  by the president. So NATO is in a strong place. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=563.24s)]
*  What the next administration does [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=565.36s)]
*  vis-a-vis its NATO policy, I'm not going to [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=567.36s)]
*  predict how the other countries are viewing [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=569.36s)]
*  the incoming administration best left [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=571.36s)]
*  to them. But the hand that is being [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=573.36s)]
*  dealt to the new administration [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=575.36s)]
*  puts them in a position to press the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=577.36s)]
*  advantage should they choose to. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=579.36s)]
*  John Feiner, thank you so much for being with us [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=581.36s)]
*  this morning. Best of luck. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnkiiuepxeU&t=583.36s)]
