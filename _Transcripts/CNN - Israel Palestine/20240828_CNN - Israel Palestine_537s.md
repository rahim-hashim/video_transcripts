# Israel launches large-scale West Bank raid
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw)
*  At least nine Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=0.0s)]
*  after the Israeli military launched raids and airstrikes overnight. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=3.16s)]
*  That's according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=6.8s)]
*  The Israeli military says it launched a large counter-terror operation [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=9.96s)]
*  overnight in two refugee camps. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=13.4s)]
*  Officials say the Israeli military was targeting, quote, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=15.16s)]
*  Islamic Iranian terrorist infrastructure. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=17.88s)]
*  CNN's Paula Hancock is live for us this hour in Abu Dhabi. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=21.0s)]
*  And Paula, this marks the largest Israeli operation in the West Bank [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=23.8s)]
*  for years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  And we understand we are hearing there's been a response from Hamas [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=28.52s)]
*  this hour to what has occurred. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=32.4s)]
*  Christina, remarks. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=38.36s)]
*  This is certainly a significant operation. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=39.16s)]
*  We have been seeing for months that there have been these limited operations [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=42.0s)]
*  by the Israeli military into the occupied West Bank. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=46.08s)]
*  Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed over recent months [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=49.2s)]
*  since October 7th of last year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=52.96s)]
*  But this is definitely something more significant [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=54.96s)]
*  that we are seeing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=57.64s)]
*  Now, we did hear from the governor of Jenin that he said just after midnight. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=58.72s)]
*  So in the early hours of Wednesday, the Israeli military surrounded [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=63.88s)]
*  the refugee camp and Jenin itself. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=69.0s)]
*  He says that he can still hear gunfire ongoing in the area. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=72.4s)]
*  So it is believed this operation is still going. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=77.88s)]
*  And he says a third of the city is without electricity at this point. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=80.64s)]
*  Now, as you say, we know that nine Palestinians have been killed. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  We hear from the Red Crescent Society, from the Ministry of Health, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=88.48s)]
*  that those deaths happened from airstrikes, also from strikes on the ground. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=93.28s)]
*  We hear drones are in the air as well. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  And when it comes to the Israeli response, so far, we understand [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=101.2s)]
*  there are hundreds, at least hundreds, of personnel involved. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=105.76s)]
*  We've been told that there are four battalions of the border police alone, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  including undercover border police. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=115.2s)]
*  And that doesn't include the military and the intelligence elements. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=118.2s)]
*  So this is a large operation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, one thing I wanted to mention was a tweet we had from the Israeli [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=123.64s)]
*  foreign minister, which was interesting. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=127.16s)]
*  He gave a reason for this operation, saying that it was to thwart [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=129.32s)]
*  what he called Islamic Iranian terrorist infrastructure, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=133.84s)]
*  saying that Iran is funding and arming terrorists in the West Bank [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=137.51999999999998s)]
*  and trying to create a situation similar to Gaza and Lebanon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  And he said, quote, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=147.32s)]
*  Now, that is significant, the fact that he's suggesting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=164.32s)]
*  there could be evacuations in the occupied West Bank, just as there are [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=167.35999999999999s)]
*  and have been in Gaza, putting really a connection between those two areas [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  and a potential Israeli reaction to those areas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=178.16s)]
*  Now, we've also heard from the Ministry of Health in the West Bank [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=182.2s)]
*  that at least two hospitals have been blocked by the Israeli military, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=186.64s)]
*  saying that there have been mounds of dirt, for example, pushed towards those areas. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=192.16s)]
*  We have seen and obtained video that would back up some of those claims. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=197.07999999999998s)]
*  We've seen some very heavy Israeli military assets in those areas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=202.88s)]
*  Bulldozers, for example, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  pushing up infrastructure and pavements and roads in those areas. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  And we are still getting information and video coming in [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  showing the extent of this operation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=220.48s)]
*  But what we're hearing from the Israeli side is that they are trying to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=224.12s)]
*  to end the Iranian terrorist infrastructure, as they put it, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=228.44s)]
*  in this this area from the Palestinian side and certainly from those in Janine, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=233.32s)]
*  one of the key areas that has been targeted, certainly from the governor. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=239.48s)]
*  They are concerned about access to hospitals, about hundreds within those hospitals itself, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=243.76s)]
*  given that they are claiming that that Israel has restricted all access there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  We heard from the Red Crescent Society as well, saying that their manoeuvring of ambulances [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=256.4s)]
*  has been heavily restricted by the Israeli military as well. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=261.28s)]
*  Max, Christina. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  If this war expands from Gaza to the West Bank, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=267.32s)]
*  that's obviously a big escalation of that war, isn't it? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  Does Israel have the resources for that? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=276.0s)]
*  I mean, I think they certainly have the resources. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=280.76s)]
*  It would be a significant escalation. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  The fact that the foreign minister is connecting the two in such a blatant way [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=286.88s)]
*  on ex-formerly noticed Twitter is significant in itself, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=292.52s)]
*  mentioning potential evacuation of Palestinian residents, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=296.92s)]
*  something that we have been seeing for months in Gaza and something we are still seeing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=301.24s)]
*  The Gaza residents have been moved sometimes a dozen times from area to area [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=306.24s)]
*  as the Israeli military tries to clear out civilians, they say, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=311.24s)]
*  and target Hamas militants that are within that area or tunnels that are within that area. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=315.24s)]
*  Now, if that were to be replicated in the West Bank, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=322.24s)]
*  it would be very significant, very devastating. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=326.24s)]
*  When you're talking about these refugee camps in the West Bank, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=330.24s)]
*  refugee camps in Nershams, for example, in Jenin, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=334.44s)]
*  they are densely populated, a very similar situation to what we see in Gaza, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=338.44s)]
*  where it would be difficult for them to be evacuated. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=344.04s)]
*  And of course, there would be a concern if this operation were to be significantly increased [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=348.24s)]
*  by the Israelis, that there would be civilian casualties within that as well. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=353.44s)]
*  At this point, the Israeli military not specifying how wide this operation is [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=359.64s)]
*  or how long it will go on for, but suffice to say it is larger than we have seen in some time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=364.64s)]
*  Paula, thank you very much. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=370.64s)]
*  Just to add to Paula's excellent reporting there, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=372.64s)]
*  that we have had a response from Hamas in the last hour calling for a general mobilization [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=375.64s)]
*  and escalation of confrontation in response to the Israeli operations in the West Bank, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=379.64s)]
*  although it is hard to see how that retaliation would actually happen [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=385.84s)]
*  given the scale of what has been occurring in the West Bank, as Paula has outlined there. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=389.84s)]
*  CNN anchor and chief national security analyst Jim Schuto is in Tel Aviv. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=393.84s)]
*  Jim, what are you learning about this operation this morning? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=397.84s)]
*  Well, John, it's the biggest Israeli operation in the West Bank since the October 7 attacks. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=402.84s)]
*  Israeli officials, the IDF, say they're going after what they call [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=407.84s)]
*  Islamic Iranian terror infrastructure. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  The allegation they're making is that weapons are coming into the West Bank [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  funded by, facilitated by Iran, and that this attack is intended to target that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  The death toll at this point stands at least nine, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  and what we're hearing now publicly in response from Hamas [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  is Hamas is calling for a mobilization of its supporters and fighters in the West Bank. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  So it's a significant operation, and that reaction from Hamas is significant. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=438.24s)]
*  Israeli officials make the point that the terror environment, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=443.24s)]
*  the threat is real now. You may remember a little more than a week ago [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=447.24s)]
*  there was a suicide bombing here in Tel Aviv where only the bomber was killed. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=450.24s)]
*  So the Israeli officials are justifying it based on the nature of the threat [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=456.24s)]
*  and what they say is the infrastructure building in the West Bank. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=460.24s)]
*  Where does this put the hostage in ceasefire negotiations? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=464.44s)]
*  Listen, you know, I've covered so many negotiations like this [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=471.44s)]
*  and oftentimes you will see attacks like this, operations like this [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=474.44s)]
*  in the midst of sensitive negotiations, and it's hard to say which way it will cut. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=477.44s)]
*  Will it disrupt those negotiations because it, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=482.44s)]
*  well, when you have Israel and Hamas carrying out operations like this [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=485.44s)]
*  against each other, certainly can make it harder for negotiators. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=489.44s)]
*  Can you make the argument that it allows Israeli negotiators [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=492.64s)]
*  to show toughness in terms of counter-terror operations [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=495.64s)]
*  and therefore make it easier to make concessions to bring a deal [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=499.64s)]
*  across the finish line? Maybe. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=502.64s)]
*  But let's be frank, those negotiations are quite sensitive right now. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=504.64s)]
*  It's not clear that they are making progress on the most intractable issues. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=508.64s)]
*  So any increase in hostilities, particularly in the West Bank, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=512.64s)]
*  are ones that you have to treat as a risk. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=516.64s)]
*  It's been notable to hear the Israeli Foreign Minister tweeting today [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=519.84s)]
*  that Israel should carry out operations in the West Bank [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=523.84s)]
*  like they've been carrying out in Gaza. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=527.84s)]
*  That certainly would be quite an escalation. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=530.84s)]
*  Yes, it would. All right, Jim Cheadle, great to have you there. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=533.84s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErHNtXvopWw&t=535.84s)]
