# ‘That sounds like ethnic cleansing’: CNN questions lead figure in Israel’s settler movement
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM)
*  High in the hills of the occupied West Bank, a flag flies in the face of a Palestinian village. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=0.0s)]
*  God is king, it says. Two young settlers guard this illegal outpost. Construction hasn't even begun, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=7.76s)]
*  but we are not welcome. So they're asking us to leave. They don't want to talk to us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=16.72s)]
*  They said they've been here for about nine months. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=24.16s)]
*  Dotted across the landscape, more signs of the fight to assert Israeli control over Palestinian land. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=27.12s)]
*  The Arabic names on signposts crudely erased. Under international law, the Beit Hagla settlement [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  is illegal, but last February, the Israeli government officially recognized it along with [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=44.44s)]
*  a move the U.S. strongly opposed. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=51.08s)]
*  We're here because God promised us this land, as Rial Picar tells us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=55.8s)]
*  Now these settlers have set their sights on a new prize, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  one that seemed utterly impossible before October 7th. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=65.64s)]
*  Returning to Gaza, they cheer. That is the goal of Zionist settler organization Nakhla, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=71.0s)]
*  one of more than a dozen groups now advocating for the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in Gaza. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=78.12s)]
*  A recent promotional video even boasts that Gaza will become the next Riviera. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=86.12s)]
*  Daniella Weiss is the godmother of the movement. She's already started recruiting from the 700,000 [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=94.84s)]
*  strong settler community of Israel. We're just arriving now at a settlement in the occupied West [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=101.96s)]
*  Bank and we're heading to a talk that Daniella Weiss is giving to a group of people who are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  potentially interested in resettling Gaza. We are for the land of Israel and Ben Gavir, she says. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  About 20 people gather in the living room of a family home. Weiss knows that for many in this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=122.36s)]
*  community there is deep nostalgia for Gush Katif, a block of 21 Israeli settlements that were [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=129.08s)]
*  forcibly evacuated by the IDF in 2005 when Israel left the Gaza Strip. This is the vision of Gaza, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=135.96s)]
*  she says. You see all the nucleus groups. A map has already been drawn up with six groups laying [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  claim to different parts of the enclaves. So they've just been handing out these little [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=153.08s)]
*  booklets that say people of Israel return home and then underneath a call to return to the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=157.72s)]
*  settlements of Gaza. One of the organizers tells the group they have a representative flying to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=164.6s)]
*  Florida to raise money. Nachala gets support from a number of groups in the U.S. including AFSI, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=171.72s)]
*  Americans for a Safe Israel, which co-sponsored a recent webinar on the return to Gush Katif, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=179.16s)]
*  even as the Biden administration has cracked down on settlements in the West Bank. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=185.8s)]
*  There is a very strong support from very prominent, from very, I would say, wealthy [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=190.52s)]
*  people, wealthy Jews in the U.S. In the U.S. Can you name any names? No, I cannot. No. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  Back at her home in Kedumim settlement, Weiss tells us she's already enrolled 500 families. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=207.8s)]
*  I even have on my cell phone names of people who say enlist me, enroll me. I want to join. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=214.84s)]
*  I want to join the groups that are going to settle Gaza. I have to ask you though, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=222.12s)]
*  because we're sitting here talking and we're listening to the call to prayer. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=226.12s)]
*  I hope you are listening to it. Which is a reminder, I think, of the people who live here, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=230.28s)]
*  but also the people who live in Gaza. What happens to them in this vision of this new settlement with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=235.79999999999998s)]
*  Jewish settlers even in Gaza City? What I think about Gaza, the Arabs of Gaza lost the right [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=242.2s)]
*  to be in Gaza on the 7th of October. Yes, I do hear the mosque. I do hear the prayer. Things were [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=249.56s)]
*  different until the 7th of October. No Arab, I'm speaking about more than two million Arabs. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=259.08s)]
*  They will not stay there. We Jews will be in Gaza. That sounds like ethnic cleansing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  The Arabs want to annihilate the state of Israel. So you can call them monsters. You can [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=272.36s)]
*  you can call them cleansing of Jews. We are not doing to them. They are doing to us. I couldn't [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=280.12s)]
*  make it clear when I said that myself as a person who is preoccupied with settling the land [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=290.28s)]
*  until the 7th of October, I didn't have plans of returning to Gaza. It's clear I'm not interested [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  in cleansing. What is clear is that Weiss's views traditionally seen as extreme in Israel [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=305.08s)]
*  have become more popular since October 7th. In late January, jubilant crowds packed an auditorium [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=312.11999999999995s)]
*  in Jerusalem for the victory of Israel conference calling for the resettlement of Gaza. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=319.32s)]
*  A poll that month from the Jewish People Policy Institute found that 26% of Israelis advocate the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=325.88s)]
*  reconstruction of the Gush Katif settlements after the war is over. Among supporters of Prime Minister [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=333.24s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's right wing coalition government, that number jumps to 51%. Several ministers were [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=339.8s)]
*  present at the conference, including far-right heritage minister Amai Eliyahu. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=347.72s)]
*  In a rare interview with Western media, he tells us his political decisions are guided by the Torah. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=355.0s)]
*  Is there anything about Gush Katif in here? Yes. Yes. And that settlements in Gaza are needed to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=362.36s)]
*  prevent another October 7th. The language of the land says that wherever there is a Jewish [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  settlement, there will be more security. Doesn't mean there will be absolute security, but there [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=376.6s)]
*  will be more security. Why would you advocate for something that many would say is illegal, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=381.56s)]
*  is immoral, is not supported by the majority of Israelis, and is also very harmful to Israel in [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=387.96000000000004s)]
*  terms of its international standing? Why do you think it's immoral to take land from someone who [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  wants to kill me? Why is it immoral to take my land, which my ancestors lived there, which I've [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=404.44s)]
*  even given up to someone who slaughters, rapes, and murders me? What is more immoral than that? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=410.44s)]
*  Netanyahu has called resettling Gaza, quote, an unrealistic goal, and most Israelis agree. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=417.48s)]
*  But that hasn't stopped scores of IDF soldiers fighting there from posting videos [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=424.84s)]
*  calling for a return to Gush Katif. For many supporters of the settler movement, what was once a distant fantasy is now a fervent dream. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkXJwErm8DM&t=429.96s)]
