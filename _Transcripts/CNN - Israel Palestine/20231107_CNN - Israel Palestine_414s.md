# White House warns Israel over post-war plans for Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc)
*  I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, will have the overall security responsibility [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=0.0s)]
*  because we've seen what happens when we don't have it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=7.44s)]
*  One month into the war with Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is giving his first indication [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=12.16s)]
*  of Israel's plans for Gaza after the fighting ends. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=16.02s)]
*  This comes as more airstrikes could be seen slamming Gaza City overnight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=18.84s)]
*  The IDF says it has secured a Hamas military stronghold in northern Gaza and struck a cell [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=23.0s)]
*  of about 10 terrorists in an anti-tank missile cell. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=27.72s)]
*  Joining us now is White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=31.0s)]
*  Admiral, I appreciate your time. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=34.36s)]
*  I want to start with what we just heard from the Prime Minister. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=35.92s)]
*  There has been a lot of discussion about what would happen after the military conflict is [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  done. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=43.92s)]
*  The President has made very clear he believes that holding Gaza, that essentially a reoccupation [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=44.92s)]
*  is not a good idea. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  What was your take on what you heard from the Prime Minister? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=54.2s)]
*  The President still believes that a reoccupation of Gaza by Israeli forces is not good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=57.08s)]
*  It's not good for Israel, not good for the Israeli people. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=61.56s)]
*  I will let Prime Minister Netanyahu speak to whatever his post-conflict plans are. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=64.12s)]
*  I can tell you though that one of the conversations that Secretary Blinken has been having in the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=68.68s)]
*  region is what does post-conflict Gaza look like? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=72.64s)]
*  What does governance look like in Gaza? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=76.88s)]
*  Because whatever it is, it can't be what it was on October 6th. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=78.68s)]
*  It can't be Hamas. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  One of the controversies in Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  They're hosting a summit of Muslim leaders this weekend. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=85.72000000000001s)]
*  There are reports that Iran's President Raisi will attend that summit. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=88.2s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  What's your response to his attendance? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't know that it tells us anything too specific, Phil. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  I think we're going to have to wait to see how this plays out and see what kind of a [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=100.4s)]
*  role, if they actually show up, what kind of role they play. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=103.56s)]
*  Our perspective is Iran is a destabilizing actor in the region. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=107.36000000000001s)]
*  They support groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  They're supporting these militia groups that continue to fire rockets at our bases in Iraq [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=112.76s)]
*  and Syria. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=116.76s)]
*  And they're also supporting Putin's war in Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=118.68s)]
*  It's difficult for us to see where Iran would have some sort of meaningful, constructive, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=121.48s)]
*  productive discussion about conflict resolution at this point, given that they're the arsonists [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=126.2s)]
*  here. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=131.32s)]
*  But again, we'll have to see what happens at this meeting this weekend. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=132.32s)]
*  You mentioned the rocket attacks on U.S. personnel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=135.4s)]
*  There have also been one-way drone attacks as well. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=137.52s)]
*  I believe there's as many as 38 or 39 U.S. personnel who have been injured in those attacks [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=139.6s)]
*  or a number of attacks that have occurred. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  Does the U.S. believe that at this point the threshold for an expanded conflict has not [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=148.92s)]
*  been crossed yet? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=153.24s)]
*  We are still working very hard to keep this conflict from widening, deepening, escalating. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=155.64s)]
*  The attacks on our troops obviously are deeply concerning. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=160.84s)]
*  You've seen us retaliate in the last week or so. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  We'll evaluate what we're going to do in terms of next steps. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=167.32s)]
*  We're obviously going to do whatever we have to do to protect our troops in Iraq and Syria, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=169.56s)]
*  make sure that we make a strong statement about force protection and how much that means [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=173.76s)]
*  to us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=178.02s)]
*  But we haven't seen another nation, state or actor move in demonstrable major muscle [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=179.08s)]
*  movement ways to try to deepen and widen this conflict as yet. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=185.6s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why the president has added so much more force posture to the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=189.36s)]
*  region now, including an Ohio-class submarine, which is now in the Central Command Area of [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=193.4s)]
*  Responsibility. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=200.56s)]
*  We're going to keep watching this. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=201.84s)]
*  If we have to make additional force posture changes, we'll do that too. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=202.84s)]
*  Did you think you'd see the day where CENTCOM would tweet out a picture of an Ohio-class [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=205.68s)]
*  submarine in transit? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=210.32s)]
*  Well, look, as you know, it's rare for the United States Navy or our combatant commanders [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=212.8s)]
*  to talk about where our submarines are and what they're doing. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=218.84s)]
*  But in this case, I think it makes perfect sense when we're trying to send a strong signal [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=222.2s)]
*  of deterrence to actors in the region so that they don't widen this conflict to let them [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  know that we've got yet additional military capability at the ready to defend our national [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=230.0s)]
*  interests. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=235.28s)]
*  The president spoke with the prime minister again yesterday. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=236.28s)]
*  They've been speaking on a very regular basis. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=237.88s)]
*  Admiral, I was struck. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  The former Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave an interview yesterday where he was talking [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=241.6s)]
*  about if he could see the window closing for the military operation due to the pressure [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  also of domestic political pressure at the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=250.88s)]
*  Has the president conveyed that to the prime minister, that there is a very small window [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=253.88s)]
*  of time to conduct these operations? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=257.76s)]
*  Well, I won't talk about the private conversation between the president and the prime minister. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=259.76s)]
*  They have a routine now sort of dialogue as these operations are ongoing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=264.8s)]
*  And again, they spoke again yesterday. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  One of the things that the president made clear to the prime minister is that we're [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=272.64s)]
*  going to continue to stand with Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=275.8s)]
*  We're going to continue to make sure that they have the security assistance they need, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=277.56s)]
*  the tools, the weapons, the capabilities to go after Hamas. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=280.48s)]
*  That hasn't changed since October 7th, and it's not going to change going forward. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=283.72s)]
*  I wanted to play for you a sound from Jordan's queen, Rania. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=288.96s)]
*  She's been very outspoken. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=291.68s)]
*  She's also Jordan is a very critical ally in the region for the United States. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=292.68s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=297.68s)]
*  If you manage to eliminate all of Hamas, what next? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=300.8s)]
*  The root cause of this conflict is an illegal occupation. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=305.4s)]
*  It is routine human rights abuses, illegal settlements, disregard to UN resolutions and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=309.47999999999996s)]
*  international law. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=316.84s)]
*  If we do not address these root causes, then you can kill the combatant, but you cannot [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=318.4s)]
*  kill the cause. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=324.64s)]
*  She is of Palestinian descent. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  I guess the question is to that point. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=330.79999999999995s)]
*  And for regional leaders who say the same thing, what is the response right now? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=333.36s)]
*  So we certainly agree that Hamas isn't just an organization. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=339.8s)]
*  There's an ideology behind this terrorist group that slaughtered 1,400 Israelis on the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=344.0s)]
*  7th of October. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=349.48s)]
*  And while you can go after the leaders and eliminate the leaders and disrupt the network, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=351.04s)]
*  and we've proven that we know how to do that against groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, it [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=354.64s)]
*  is difficult to kill the ideology. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=358.48s)]
*  Now, she's also talking about history here and how things ended up the way they did in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=360.32s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=364.96s)]
*  And I think that the history is obviously long. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=366.96s)]
*  It's complicated. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=369.84s)]
*  It's complex. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=370.84s)]
*  And it's good for all of us to remind ourselves of how we got here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=371.84s)]
*  But it's also important to remember that we still believe in a two-state solution. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=376.0s)]
*  In the United States, we still, President Biden still supports this as a viable vision [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=379.6s)]
*  for both a Jewish democratic state and a free and independent Palestinian state. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=385.48s)]
*  That is the way we believe that both sides can live in peace and security going forward. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  And even though we're in the middle of a conflict, Phil, the president hasn't given up on that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=394.76s)]
*  And we're continuing to talk to our partners throughout the region about how to get back [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=398.72s)]
*  on track to some sort of viable two-state solution here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=402.68s)]
*  John Kirby, we appreciate the time and your ability to fight through the leap lowers behind [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=406.20000000000005s)]
*  you. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=410.88s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=411.88s)]
*  I appreciate it as always. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=412.88s)]
*  You bet. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3TWRghbSsc&t=413.88s)]
