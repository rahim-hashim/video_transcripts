# Should Congress set conditions on Israel aid? Hear what this representative thinks
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI)
*  Well, the truth is over. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=0.0s)]
*  The fighting between Israel and Hamas is back, and so is the nightmare for innocent civilians. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=2.36s)]
*  Israel says that it's using QR codes now and interactive maps to tell Gazans where to go. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=8.2s)]
*  Remember, cell service and electricity are sparse there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=14.24s)]
*  National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby was asked on Friday about the number [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=17.84s)]
*  of civilians who have already died since bombing resumed in Gaza, and he would not say if the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=21.52s)]
*  Biden administration has seen more deliberate targeting from Israel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=27.32s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said that he wanted to see Israeli plans to protect [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=31.8s)]
*  civilians before fighting resumed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=36.04s)]
*  This is his latest comment. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=38.88s)]
*  I have seen that information start to get out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=42.16s)]
*  I saw the plans that Israel has in a multiplicity of ways to do everything possible to protect [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  civilians, including making sure that they have the information they need and that there [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=52.08s)]
*  are ways to accommodate them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=57.28s)]
*  And this is going to be very important going forward, and it's something we're going to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=59.76s)]
*  be looking at very closely. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=62.2s)]
*  All right now, the U.S. is watching, but is there anything more that the U.S. could be [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=68.75999999999999s)]
*  doing? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=74.08s)]
*  One option is adding conditions to any aid that the U.S. provides to Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=75.24s)]
*  Some Democratic senators support it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=81.16000000000001s)]
*  House Republicans do not. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Plenty of House Democrats oppose it too, including Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=85.2s)]
*  Florida. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=91.4s)]
*  She is on the House Appropriations Committee, and she joins me now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=92.4s)]
*  It's been a while since we have talked, so it's good to have you on the show, Congresswoman. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=95.28s)]
*  Congratulations on your new show. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad to join you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  Why do you oppose putting some conditions on the multi-billion dollar package that Israel [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=105.48s)]
*  will most certainly get? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=112.24s)]
*  Well, Victor, I think it's important that we understand here that we are, this is not [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=114.24s)]
*  a situation where we don't have the ability to communicate with Israel. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=120.44s)]
*  They are a close ally, among our closest. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  Our intelligence and military leadership are sitting together with Israel side by side [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=127.88s)]
*  every day. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=132.68s)]
*  That communication is ongoing at the highest levels, all the way up to President Biden. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  And we are working with them to make sure, as they are already prioritizing and minimizing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=138.24s)]
*  civilian casualties, it's Hamas that is putting civilians in harm's way, embedding themselves [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  and their headquarters underneath hospitals and U.N. facilities. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=149.88s)]
*  And I mean, that's where the accountability should lie, and making sure that Israel can [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=154.88s)]
*  bring their hostages home and Hamas release them and make sure that they can eradicate [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=159.84s)]
*  the terrorist threat is what the priority is. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=165.04s)]
*  Conditioning aid is not something you do in an emergency situation with an ally. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=167.56s)]
*  So you are right that the civilians in Gaza would not be in this position. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  The estimated more than 14,000 who have been killed since October 7th would not be dead [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=178.88s)]
*  if not for the October 7th attack. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=185.34s)]
*  But if the point that you're making is that the U.S. has been sitting side by side with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  Israel since the start of this, well, since October 7th, I understand that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=194.06s)]
*  But since the start of this, there have been those 14,000 plus killed. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=201.5s)]
*  There have been, according to UNICEF, 5,300 children killed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=206.16s)]
*  So if it did not influence their decision of targeting before the truce, why are you [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=210.78s)]
*  confident that there will be anything different now as they move into the South? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  Victor, Israel, first of all, Israel is held to a much, much higher standard when at war [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=221.54s)]
*  than any other country on Earth. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=228.22s)]
*  And they have specifically, nearly exclusively in a wartime, made sure to notify and communicate [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=230.26s)]
*  in advance with civilians, particularly in this very urbanized environment, that they [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=237.5s)]
*  should get out of harm's way. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=243.82s)]
*  Hamas, the terrorist organization that puts them in harm's way, prevents them from getting [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=245.45999999999998s)]
*  into safety. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=250.82s)]
*  And this is a very dense, urbanized area in which Hamas has not actually spent the funds [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=251.82s)]
*  that they have to protect their civilians. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  They have said publicly in interviews that they spend their money on their tunnel system [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=262.06s)]
*  so they can protect themselves. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=267.14s)]
*  So Hamas is to blame for the harm that is coming to their civilians. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=268.86s)]
*  But go where? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=271.94s)]
*  I should say that the IDF is warning the civilians to get out of the way. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=272.98s)]
*  And I should say that the leaflets have been dropped over the cities in southern Gaza that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=276.74s)]
*  they are focusing on now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=282.78s)]
*  But they're using QR codes. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=284.7s)]
*  We have reported that how unreliable cell phone service is, the electricity, the internet [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=286.62s)]
*  as well. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=292.18s)]
*  So I don't know what a QR code does, anybody who doesn't have cell phone service and doesn't [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=293.18s)]
*  have access to the internet. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=297.34s)]
*  But if the IDF has told them to move south, where are they supposed to go now? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=299.18s)]
*  What should happen here is that Hamas should release the hostages. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=305.7s)]
*  They should cease their attacks, a ceasefire that they yet again broke just yesterday, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=310.82s)]
*  even before it was determined that the truce was not going to continue. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=316.86s)]
*  This is on Hamas. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=321.54s)]
*  That's where this conflict was started. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=323.3s)]
*  They have killed 1,400 civilians in an unprecedented attack in Israel. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=325.5s)]
*  They took 240 women, children, and elderly people hostage, most of whom they are still [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  holding on to. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  Where are the, I mean, Victor, I wish you were asking me questions about how Hamas is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  being held to account. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=344.09999999999997s)]
*  That is where Gaza needs to be freed from Hamas. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=346.06s)]
*  And we already have the ability, thanks to President Biden. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=349.29999999999995s)]
*  We are already communicating. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=352.28s)]
*  We've gotten dozens and dozens, actually hundreds of aid trucks into Israel, into Gaza, and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  Hamas skims off the top to make sure that they can re-fortify and be able to be strong. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=360.76s)]
*  Those trucks are getting in, those trucks are getting in after a nearly month-long blockade [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=367.08s)]
*  on food and fuel and water and the fuel obviously challenging the desalination plant. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  But let me ask you about, you say that this is on Hamas. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=380.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=383.5s)]
*  They are taking back humanitarian aid for themselves. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=384.5s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=387.38s)]
*  But here's the question. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=390.38s)]
*  You say this is on Hamas. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=391.38s)]
*  I understand that the Israeli government has said that ending Hamas is the goal. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=392.46s)]
*  I think most states across the world, most countries can understand that after what happened [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=397.94s)]
*  on October 7th, that is the goal. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=402.02s)]
*  to go after Hamas and there are innocent civilians between them, what pressure do you think, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=406.5s)]
*  if at all, is required or is appropriate on Israel to prevent the numbers that we saw [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=412.26s)]
*  in the first 45 days of this war? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=419.74s)]
*  We are with Israel effectively communicating that it is essential that they minimize civilian [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=423.52s)]
*  casualties. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=432.26s)]
*  The Palestinian civilians that have been killed as a result of Hamas' brutality is devastating. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=433.26s)]
*  If they don't, then what? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=439.94s)]
*  If they don't, then what? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=441.78s)]
*  If there's no consequence and Congress is not going to put any conditions on the aid, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=442.78s)]
*  and this is not advocacy, I'm just saying what then is the consequence for Israel? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=447.02s)]
*  What do you mean by if they don't? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=452.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we're already in a situation where worldwide, including the UN, UN women and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=453.94s)]
*  others have not even condemned Hamas for their attacks and they haven't condemned them for [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=460.34s)]
*  the brutal sexual violence. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=465.29999999999995s)]
*  Israel is under a situation where it's me too, unless you're a Jew, and the higher standard [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=468.09999999999997s)]
*  that Israel is held to in wartime when they have suffered an incredibly brutal attack [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=473.58s)]
*  is wildly inappropriate in an emergency and this disproportionate accountability that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=479.58s)]
*  Israel is being held to when Hamas completely controls the ability to cease the war by releasing [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=486.1s)]
*  the hostages and ending their commitment to eradicating Israel and killing Jews. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=493.42s)]
*  Alright, Congresswoman Debbie Was... [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=499.62s)]
*  ...in their court. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=501.42s)]
*  Congresswoman Debbie Waserman-Schultz, thank you so much for being with me. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=502.90000000000003s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=506.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NklBbp7BMI&t=507.42s)]
