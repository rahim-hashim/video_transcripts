# Analysts break down significance of Israel’s strikes in Lebanon
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM)
*  Ricky News, we're following in the Middle East. Lebanon, I'm now saying at least 492 people have been killed in the latest wave of Israeli attacks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=0.0s)]
*  CNN's Jeremy Diamond has our report. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=8.0s)]
*  Israeli airstrikes battering southern and eastern Lebanon. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=14.0s)]
*  It is the most intense Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since the 2006 war and the deadliest. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=19.0s)]
*  Hundreds were killed and many more injured as the Israeli military said it targeted Hezbollah weapons depots and rocket launchers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=27.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israeli air defenses springing into action as Hezbollah fired more than 200 rockets and drones at Israel, targeting the city of Haifa and aiming further south than usual. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=35.0s)]
*  At least two rockets hitting the West Bank, more than 60 miles south of the Lebanese border and just east of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=47.0s)]
*  As Israeli fighter jets carried out some 1,300 airstrikes today, the country's leaders say they are deliberately escalating, hoping to change the equation. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=54.0s)]
*  I promise to change the security balance, the balance of power in the north. This is exactly what we're doing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=65.0s)]
*  We're dismantling thousands of rockets and missiles aimed at Israeli cities and citizens. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=72.0s)]
*  Lebanese officials say this is simply Israeli aggression. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=78.0s)]
*  The continuing Israeli aggression on Lebanon is a war of extermination in every sense of the word and a destructive plan aimed at destroying Lebanese villages and towns and eliminating green areas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=82.0s)]
*  In Lebanon, Israel's new escalatory strategy is pushing thousands to flee their homes. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=95.0s)]
*  As the Israeli military sent mass text messages, including to some residents of the Lebanese capital, and interrupted radio broadcasts. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=102.0s)]
*  Purging residents in southern and eastern Lebanon to evacuate. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=112.0s)]
*  In Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=117.0s)]
*  This warning is focused on the villages in the Beqaa Valley. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=120.0s)]
*  Residents were given just two hours notice before Israeli jets began hitting targets, including homes where the Israeli military says Hezbollah is storing rockets and weapons. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=123.0s)]
*  As smoke engulfed swaths of Lebanon, many now fear this is just the beginning, as the prospect of all-out war now looms larger than ever. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=134.0s)]
*  And Wolff, this evening the Israeli cabinet approving a quote special situation across Israel, this empowering the government to put in place emergency measures to limit civilian activity should it deem that necessary. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=148.0s)]
*  Clear evidence that this country is on a war footing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=161.0s)]
*  The Israeli government clearly aiming to try and escalate the situation in Lebanon in order to try and get Hezbollah to back down. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=164.0s)]
*  But for now, Hezbollah is simply showing that it is willing and capable of striking deeper into Israel than before. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=172.0s)]
*  Wolff. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=178.0s)]
*  Alright, Jeremy Diamond reporting from Haifa, Israel up in the north. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=179.0s)]
*  Stay safe over there, Jeremy. Thank you very much. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=182.0s)]
*  Joining us now CNN political and global affairs analyst Barak Ravid and Kim Gataz, a distinguished fellow at the Columbia University Institute of Global Politics. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=185.0s)]
*  And Kim, I know you're in Beirut. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=195.0s)]
*  How devastating have these Israeli attacks been, these attacks against Hezbollah? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=197.0s)]
*  And for Lebanese civilians, how devastating has it been? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=202.0s)]
*  Wolff, great to be with you on the show. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=207.0s)]
*  The escalation in Israeli strikes today against Lebanon has had a devastating toll already. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=209.0s)]
*  The single deadliest day for Lebanon in many decades, almost 500 killed and 1600 injured, many of them women and children. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=215.0s)]
*  And of course, some of them or many of them will also have been members of Hezbollah. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=226.0s)]
*  But the sheer terror that the Lebanese are living through, pondering the possibility of even further strikes and a prolonged war, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=230.0s)]
*  comes on top of a day of a terror last week when we had these pager attacks, pagers blowing up across the country, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=239.0s)]
*  which really sent people scurrying, sirens wailing, people going to hospitals, flooding the hospitals. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=250.0s)]
*  And so that leads to a week on a national level of deep trauma for Lebanese civilians in a war that they have not chosen [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=257.0s)]
*  and which Hezbollah started on the 8th of October when it launched its first missiles against Israel after the horrific attacks by Hamas on the 7th of October. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=266.0s)]
*  This is a country without a president, with a caretaker government and barely functioning institutions. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=276.0s)]
*  So the Lebanese feel very much trapped at the moment. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=281.0s)]
*  The Israelis are saying that they hope that Hezbollah will back down and that this is escalation to lead to de-escalation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=284.0s)]
*  I don't see that happening. I don't see Hezbollah backing down and admitting defeat, even though they've been severely degraded. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=293.0s)]
*  Let me get Barak to weigh in on this as well. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=299.0s)]
*  Barak, Israel seems to think this latest barrage could force Hezbollah to de-escalate. Could that though backfire? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=301.0s)]
*  Well, I think there are a lot of people who are concerned that once you escalate, and this started several days ago, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=310.0s)]
*  we are now at the fourth or fifth stage of escalation in one week, and Hezbollah hasn't backed down. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=319.0s)]
*  And the fear is that this thing will continue for another week, two weeks, three weeks. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=328.0s)]
*  What if Hezbollah doesn't back down then? Does this mean that Israel will invade Lebanon with ground forces? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=335.0s)]
*  Something that both Prime Minister Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Galant and the IDF really don't want to do. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=342.0s)]
*  So in a way, even though it has taken tremendous hits in the last few days, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=349.0s)]
*  Hezbollah will still determine whether this thing will stop or it will continue indefinitely. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=355.0s)]
*  You know, Kim, as you know, Israel has killed many of Hezbollah's top commanders during this latest assault, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=363.0s)]
*  including some of those commanders who were responsible for the terror attack against the U.S. Embassy in Beirut back in 1983 [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=369.0s)]
*  and the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983. How does that influence Hezbollah's possible response? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=376.0s)]
*  Well, they seem to have been thrown into chaos. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=384.0s)]
*  You know, the leadership decapitated their ability to communicate severely degraded. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=388.0s)]
*  But as you saw, they're still able to launch missiles and rockets at Israel. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=395.0s)]
*  They seem to have either because they are not able to or because they've consciously decided to not to further escalate themselves. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=401.0s)]
*  I know that for residents of Israel and northern Israel, it does look like Hezbollah is escalating. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=409.0s)]
*  But compared to Israel's strikes against Lebanon, you could argue that Hezbollah's reaction is still somewhat contained. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=414.0s)]
*  We'll have to see whether that continues, whether they're simply trying to regroup so that they can land a devastating blow on Israel. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=421.0s)]
*  They're not going to simply back down and admit defeat. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=430.0s)]
*  We need creative diplomacy to provide an off-ramp to a group that has said they will not stop firing into northern Israel unless there is a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=434.0s)]
*  If there is no ceasefire in Gaza, we need creative diplomacy with the help of the United States, France, and Arab countries [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=445.0s)]
*  to help find a way out on an off-ramp so that someone within Hezbollah can say, for the sake of Lebanon, we are now going to step down. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=452.0s)]
*  But they're not going to admit defeat short of that. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=463.0s)]
*  I'll be surprised if that happens. It looks like it's escalating very, very quickly. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=465.0s)]
*  Kim Gattas, Barack Ravi, to both of you, thank you very, very much. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXV7Tkc5pM&t=469.0s)]
