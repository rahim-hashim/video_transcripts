# Nova music festival survivor reunites with man who saved her
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE)
*  It's been 76 days since Hamas militants massacred hundreds at a music festival in southern Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=0.0s)]
*  And now one woman who survived has returned to the scene to be reunited with the man who saved her life. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=5.0s)]
*  Here's CNN's Will Ripley. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=11.0s)]
*  Looking at that cloud of smoke, what does that trigger for you? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=15.0s)]
*  So seeing the smoke definitely reminds me of those noises that bring me back to that day. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=18.0s)]
*  In southern Israel, you don't need a map to know you're near Gaza. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=23.0s)]
*  Why are you here? Why do you want to go back? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=27.0s)]
*  That loud boom, outgoing artillery near our car. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=31.0s)]
*  Rattling native New Yorker, Natalie Senedaji. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=35.0s)]
*  Tell me what that made you feel like just now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=38.0s)]
*  I got scared that we were being shot at. I'm fine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=40.0s)]
*  The last time she was on this road, Natalie was running for her life. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=45.0s)]
*  Just after sunrise on Saturday, October 7th, rocket interceptions seen from the dance floor at the Nova Music Festival. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=50.0s)]
*  Hamas militants killed more than 350 people, mostly young, mostly Jewish, mostly unarmed. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=58.0s)]
*  I feel so lucky that I made it out, that I got out alive. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=65.0s)]
*  I feel that it's my duty to be that voice for all those who weren't as lucky as me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=71.0s)]
*  That sense of duty is why she's returning to Israel for the first time since the attacks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=77.0s)]
*  Just seeing all these faces and knowing people that loved these faces. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=82.0s)]
*  Faces of friends who never made it home. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=87.0s)]
*  Oh my God, she's someone I recognize. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=90.0s)]
*  It's so crazy, you know, I was dancing right next to them, you know. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=94.0s)]
*  It's so hard to see how many of them there are. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=98.0s)]
*  And it could have been you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=101.0s)]
*  The music festival campsite, now a place where families come to grieve. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=103.0s)]
*  Rockets in the sky, gunshots on the ground. All she could do was run. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=108.0s)]
*  Many took cover in bathrooms, bomb shelters, ditches. Most of them ended up dead. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=113.0s)]
*  Four hours of running, exhausted, dehydrated. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=118.0s)]
*  I never thought that I would literally just sit down and accept my fate. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=122.0s)]
*  Too tired to run as a truck came closer. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=126.0s)]
*  We have nowhere to run to. Where are we going to get up and run to? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=129.0s)]
*  If this is a terrorist coming to kill us, that's it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=132.0s)]
*  Kind of like that one, yeah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=135.0s)]
*  The man behind the wheel, not a terrorist, from a nearby village. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=137.0s)]
*  Natalie never got his name. She only tracked him down a few days ago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=141.0s)]
*  It's why she's come back, to thank him. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=145.0s)]
*  They're about to meet for the first time since that day. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=148.0s)]
*  The man fighting back tears, Moshe Sati, an Israeli father of four who left home [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=151.0s)]
*  and drove directly into danger. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=157.0s)]
*  Not once or twice, more than ten trips to and from the music festival site. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=159.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=165.0s)]
*  I didn't know you were coming. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=167.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=169.0s)]
*  I told you we were in trouble together. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=171.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=173.0s)]
*  I didn't know you were coming. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=175.0s)]
*  Me too. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=177.0s)]
*  I told you we were in trouble together. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=179.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=181.0s)]
*  You live so close to this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=183.0s)]
*  But were you prepared fully for what you saw on October 7th? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=185.0s)]
*  It won't be forgotten in life. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=190.0s)]
*  Things like this, you can't forget. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=193.0s)]
*  I'll never forget what I saw. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=196.0s)]
*  It's very, very tough. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=198.0s)]
*  Haunted by the horrors he saw, heartened by the lives he saved. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=202.0s)]
*  So many people were saved in this truck. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=207.0s)]
*  Natalie, one of well over 100 people, he packed into his pickup and drove to safety. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=210.0s)]
*  This truck saved so many lives. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=218.0s)]
*  It just looks like an average truck, but I stood right there in that corner. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=221.0s)]
*  If it wasn't for him, I truly don't think I would have been here today. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=226.0s)]
*  One bright chapter on a very dark day. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=229.0s)]
*  Natalie told us one reason she's sharing her story is she doesn't want people to forget that there is a human face to all of this. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=235.0s)]
*  These young people who were killed on October 7th have been politicized, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=243.0s)]
*  and Natalie herself has been the target of pretty intense online hate as a result of sharing her story. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=247.0s)]
*  She wants people to remember that civilians on both sides are dying, and they have families, they have people who love them, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=253.0s)]
*  and she says they need to be remembered. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvqKs9TRKoE&t=260.0s)]
