# Hamas propaganda video shows guerrilla warfare tactics
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg)
*  Israel's military now what it calls the heart of Gaza City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=0.0s)]
*  They said today it destroyed more tunnels used by Hamas. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=3.52s)]
*  According to the IDF, these tunnels were located near a school sponsored by the UN. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=6.08s)]
*  The IDF also announced today it destroyed at least 130 tunnel shafts since the start of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=10.96s)]
*  the war. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=14.96s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this week that Israel would maintain security [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=15.96s)]
*  over the Gaza Strip for quote, an indefinite period. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=19.72s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond has more, including new footage of what that urban combat looks like. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=22.92s)]
*  An Israeli armored vehicle advances through the Al-Shati refugee camp, but an ambush awaits. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=29.72s)]
*  Moments earlier, the same video shows a Hamas fighter armed with a rocket-propelled grenade [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=38.0s)]
*  moving slowly from behind the rubble. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=43.64s)]
*  These are Hamas propaganda videos from the perspective of its fighters, showing Hamas [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=47.4s)]
*  militants peering around buildings and through the rubble before striking armored vehicles. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=52.72s)]
*  CNN has geolocated several videos released in recent days to northern Gaza, in Beit Hanun, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=59.84s)]
*  Atatra and the Shati refugee camp, indicating Hamas is likely still mounting attacks in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=66.2s)]
*  areas Israeli forces entered over a week ago. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=72.84s)]
*  The videos provide a limited window into the group's guerrilla tactics and the threats [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=76.16s)]
*  Israeli forces face as they move deeper into Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=81.12s)]
*  As we're moving in, we're fighting more and more close combat, urban combat type engagement. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=84.96s)]
*  The Israeli military says its forces have encircled and are now operating in the heart [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  of Gaza City, where they face the dangers of dense urban combat and a vast network of [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=97.11999999999999s)]
*  tunnels Hamas fighters are using to sneak up on Israeli forces. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=103.24s)]
*  The nature of urban warfare is that they go down a tunnel and come up somewhere else, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=108.08s)]
*  and that is exactly why we're moving slowly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=112.28s)]
*  We're not advancing, we're not rushing into this, we're taking strategic positions. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=114.2s)]
*  Israeli forces say they've destroyed 130 Hamas tunnel shafts like this one since launching [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=119.56s)]
*  their ground offensive. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=125.16s)]
*  We're just scratching the surface of that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=126.56s)]
*  But many more still remain. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=128.66s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond joins us now. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=132.44s)]
*  What's the latest on evacuation options for civilians in Gaza? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=133.6s)]
*  Well, Anderson, in recent days, tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians have used those [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=137.32s)]
*  evacuation corridors established by the Israeli military over the last several days to flee [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=143.7s)]
*  south. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=148.38s)]
*  In fact, just today, according to the United Nations, 50,000 people took advantage of a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=149.38s)]
*  five-hour window to evacuate south using Salah al-Din Road, one of the main arteries [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=153.74s)]
*  going north-south in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=158.9s)]
*  And all of this, Anderson, comes not only as the Israeli military is ramping up its [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=161.06s)]
*  military operations in northern Gaza, but also, of course, as the humanitarian situation [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=164.74s)]
*  there has grown worse. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=169.3s)]
*  is extremely limited. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=172.18s)]
*  Hospitals are running out of medical supplies, running out of fuel to carry out even basic [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=174.02s)]
*  operational matters. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=178.46s)]
*  And Israeli officials are, of course, ramping up their ground offensive in northern Gaza. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=181.18s)]
*  Israeli officials now saying that Israeli troops are operating in the heart of Gaza [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=186.94s)]
*  City, pressing forward with this advance as the Israeli prime minister vows no ceasefire [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=191.3s)]
*  unless hostages are released. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=196.42000000000002s)]
*  Anderson. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, thanks so much. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  Many Palestinian Americans who made it out of Gaza are just now getting home facing a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=200.06s)]
*  very particular heartache. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=204.26s)]
*  They're relieved, obviously, to be safe, but worried every moment about their friends and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=205.5s)]
*  family who are not. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=208.9s)]
*  My next guests are Americans who, along with their almost two-year-old son, were in Gaza [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=210.98s)]
*  on October 7th, visiting family. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  They just got back to their home in Massachusetts earlier this week. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=216.26s)]
*  Abud Okal and Wafa Abouzadeh join us now. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=220.82s)]
*  Welcome home, first of all. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=227.86s)]
*  How do you feel? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=229.42s)]
*  Are you exhausted? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=230.42s)]
*  We feel... [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=233.01999999999998s)]
*  I had a mixed feeling, to be honest. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=234.66s)]
*  I feel unhappy because we're safe here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=237.74s)]
*  We're back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=241.42s)]
*  But our thinking, minds in Gaza, because I still have my parents over there, Abud's parents [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=242.42s)]
*  still over there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  We text them every minute to make sure they're okay. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=258.3s)]
*  We made it here just because of Yousef. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=265.42s)]
*  I want to make sure he's okay, he's safe. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=268.78000000000003s)]
*  Yousef is your baby? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=271.18s)]
*  Yousef is my baby. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=272.66s)]
*  He's going to turn two years next month. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=274.38s)]
*  You got home in time for his birthday. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=278.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=280.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=281.06s)]
*  What was... [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=282.06s)]
*  You had gone there both to visit family. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=283.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=284.38s)]
*  And you'd spent a couple weeks there. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=285.38s)]
*  And you had no idea this all was about to happen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=286.78s)]
*  When did you realize... [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=291.09999999999997s)]
*  Was it on the morning of October 7th that you realized something has happened? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=292.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=296.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=297.34s)]
*  I think that October 7th, it was 6-ish o'clock in the morning local time. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=298.34s)]
*  And I think I remember hearing sounds of rockets launching. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=302.65999999999997s)]
*  And I woke up Wafa and I said, I think that is the sound of rockets. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=307.97999999999996s)]
*  Then we checked out the windows and indeed it was. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=314.7s)]
*  And then a few minutes later we were trying to look at news. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=317.7s)]
*  And then it was unclear at the beginning. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=320.94s)]
*  But then in a couple of hours as news rolled out of what was happening that day, we realized [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=323.42s)]
*  that we are in trouble and that this is going to be a big event. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=328.86s)]
*  What was that going south? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=336.38s)]
*  Was it difficult? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=337.76s)]
*  I mean, once you actually got together and headed down there. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=338.76s)]
*  It was chaotic. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=341.3s)]
*  I think early that day when we heard the announcement by the IDF to head south, there was no timeline [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=342.42s)]
*  given. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=348.42s)]
*  There were no specific instructions other than just go past south of Wadi Ghazza, which [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=349.42s)]
*  is basically Gaza Valley, a landmark. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  So everyone scrambled. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=358.34s)]
*  At this point, I mean, did you think the border might still be open? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=359.98s)]
*  Because I mean, there was so much misinformation, so much... [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=363.9s)]
*  I mean, people didn't know what was going on. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=366.26s)]
*  But that Rafa border has been shut this whole time. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=368.08s)]
*  Did you think you could get out at that point or just thought, get south and we'll figure [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  it out? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=375.8s)]
*  Yeah, we tried a couple of times going to Rafa border. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=376.8s)]
*  But every time we wait for a couple of hours and the gate is not opening. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=379.76s)]
*  So leave. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=385.92s)]
*  And you were in a house staying with dozens of other people? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=386.92s)]
*  Yeah, 40 people. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  40 people. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=392.16s)]
*  40 people. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=393.16s)]
*  Yeah, we used to share everything with 40 people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=394.16s)]
*  And getting supplies and things, what was that like? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=396.72s)]
*  It was so difficult. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=400.20000000000005s)]
*  It was so difficult. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  Your baby needs milk. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  Even that is... [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=405.64000000000004s)]
*  Even that, yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=407.16s)]
*  We used to wake up every morning thinking about like how we're going to get water, bread, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=408.16s)]
*  food. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  Abu used to go with his brother waiting on the line getting water and bread and come [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  back after seven, six hours with one gallon of water for 40 people. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=425.56s)]
*  And then like pieces of bread, it's not enough for 40 people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=434.0s)]
*  So we used to share with. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=440.24s)]
*  With a child, I mean, I think about it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=442.68s)]
*  Obviously all those kids, was he scared? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=445.24s)]
*  What was his sense of what was going on? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=452.88s)]
*  I taught myself I have to be relaxed when I hear all the sounds. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=456.68s)]
*  So I started to teach him, OK, this is what you hear. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=462.52s)]
*  This is a fireworks. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=466.68s)]
*  Remember the 4th of July? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=467.68s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=469.64s)]
*  I don't know if... [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=473.0s)]
*  I don't think he trusted me. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't think he believed that this is a fireworks. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=476.6s)]
*  And at some point the milk ran out. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=480.08s)]
*  At some point the milk did run out. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=482.4s)]
*  Yeah, the milk ran out in the beginning because I knew it's we're going to run out at some [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=484.0s)]
*  point. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=491.0s)]
*  So I started to reduce his bottle, like from whole bottle to half bottle giving him. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  So the last five days or a week, so we run completely out of milk. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=500.76s)]
*  I used to give him water instead of milk. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  It's got to be this strange feeling of being relieved that you're out and yet your family [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=511.92s)]
*  is there. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=519.08s)]
*  We're still processing what we experienced. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=520.08s)]
*  I can't believe, I can't believe our short trip just turned into a nightmare. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=523.5600000000001s)]
*  And even though we're physically out, I think mentally we're still there. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=529.0s)]
*  I think at some points it cannot be worse to be on the outside. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=532.64s)]
*  Everything is worse than being inside of Gaza right now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=538.0s)]
*  If you're not dying from airstrikes or shelling, you're at high risk of dying because of dehydration [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=541.72s)]
*  and lack of food. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=548.52s)]
*  Despite that little aid that's coming in, it's not really making, it's not moving the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=550.88s)]
*  needle. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=555.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you so much. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm so glad you're back. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=557.64s)]
*  But I understand that tug and that feel of family left behind. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=560.0s)]
*  I'm sorry that you have that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=565.12s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=567.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=568.56s)]
*  Thank you, Anderson. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W57OwQkaEg&t=569.56s)]
