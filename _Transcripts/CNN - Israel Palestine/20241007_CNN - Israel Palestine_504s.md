# CNN speaks to mothers in Israel and Gaza after a year of anguish
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs)
*  Today marks one year since the Hamas attacks on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=0.0s)]
*  Dozens of people taken hostage on that day [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=2.84s)]
*  are still in the hands of Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Over the past year, Israel has launched [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=7.88s)]
*  retaliatory attacks on Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=9.68s)]
*  They've destroyed much of Gaza's housing and infrastructure [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=11.76s)]
*  and killed more than 41,000 people, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=14.96s)]
*  according to Palestinian officials. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  It's been a year of anguish, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  especially for the mothers whose sons and daughters [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=21.04s)]
*  are caught in the middle of this war. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=23.52s)]
*  Here's CNN's Jeremy Diamond with their story, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=25.88s)]
*  and I have to warn you, some of the images in this report are graphic. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=27.92s)]
*  Words alone cannot capture a mother's pain, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  but the anguish on their faces paints a devastating picture [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=54.36s)]
*  of the countless lives upended by Hamas's October 7th attack [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=59.0s)]
*  and Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=65.8s)]
*  One year later, Fatin Mareish is still grieving the loss of her two sons, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=68.72s)]
*  killed in an Israeli airstrike this summer. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=74.36s)]
*  Simona Steinbrecher doesn't know her daughter's fate. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=78.84s)]
*  She is being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  Stepping inside the home where she was abducted is like going back in time. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=85.2s)]
*  They broke the windows. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=90.28s)]
*  They came from the window. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=93.64s)]
*  Shards of glass still crunch underfoot [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=97.2s)]
*  in a home upturned and uprooted from the peace it once provided. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=100.88s)]
*  And in the bedroom, a mother recounts her daughter's abduction. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  She was very afraid because you can hear from the voice that she said, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=110.96s)]
*  they take me, they take me. She was really afraid. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=118.44s)]
*  She was on the phone with you when she was being taken. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=120.55999999999999s)]
*  Yes. And we don't know nothing about her, what happened with her. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=122.88s)]
*  We don't know if she's alive. We don't know nothing. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=127.8s)]
*  Doron Steinbrecher's cry for help captured in one final voice note. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  Tafsut, tafsut, tafsut, tafsut. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  She was one of 251 people taken hostage on October 7th, 2023, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=139.48s)]
*  after Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killing about 1200 people, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=146.0s)]
*  most of whom were civilians. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Israel's history, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=153.84s)]
*  carried out at a music festival in people's homes [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=157.44s)]
*  and against those who fled into bomb shelters. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=162.16s)]
*  There's a gunshot inside the house. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=165.88s)]
*  In Kfar Aza, this small kibbutz on the Gaza border, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=168.48s)]
*  Hamas kidnapped 19, including Simona's daughter, Doron. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=171.72s)]
*  Did you ever imagine that you would be sitting here a year later? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=177.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=180.16s)]
*  And she would still be in Gaza? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=180.92s)]
*  No, never. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=182.48s)]
*  But now we see that there's another day, another week, another month, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=184.4s)]
*  and nothing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=192.72s)]
*  The first sign of life came nearly four months later. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  Doron, gaunt and pale, appears in a Hamas hostage video. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=199.0s)]
*  I was happy that I can see that she's alive. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  But then I can look at her and I can see the difference. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=208.04s)]
*  What does the government tell you? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=214.72s)]
*  They tell us, the family, that they make everything, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=216.48s)]
*  that they will come back. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=221.44s)]
*  But they are still there, so something is wrong, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=223.68s)]
*  something is not working. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=229.04000000000002s)]
*  Those frustrations shifted into overdrive in August [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=231.76s)]
*  after Hamas executed six hostages, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=235.08s)]
*  families like Doron's now fearing the worst. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=238.28s)]
*  You feel like the longer she's there, the less likely it is [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=241.72s)]
*  that she could come back alive. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=248.84s)]
*  They don't have time. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=251.48s)]
*  For nearly 10 months, Fatin managed to keep her family safe, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=256.44s)]
*  fleeing from one place to another as Israel pummeled the Gaza Strip [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=261.4s)]
*  with bombs and missiles, a school, a relative's home, a tent. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=265.32s)]
*  I tried to make it easier for them to go to the streets. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=270.64s)]
*  I was taking care of the kids. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=277.6s)]
*  But nowhere in Gaza is truly safe. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=283.12s)]
*  CPR cannot bring her five-year-old son Jude back to life. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=286.48s)]
*  But Fatin cannot believe it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=291.12s)]
*  She had only just left the tent they were living in [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  to buy Jude Indomi his favorite instant noodles. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=295.88s)]
*  But as she cradles her youngest, her eldest son's body arrives at the morgue. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  Mohammed is dead too, his mother and father in agony. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=308.56s)]
*  Amid their unspeakable grief, there is also anger [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=313.6s)]
*  God open your eyes to me! [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=317.92s)]
*  at Israel, at Hamas, and that a world she feels has abandoned them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=321.36s)]
*  This is all that is left of the tent where Mohammed and Jude were staying [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=329.44s)]
*  when a missile struck just a few feet away, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=333.76000000000005s)]
*  where their mother now asks what her children did to deserve this fate. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=336.56s)]
*  Jude would have turned six years old last month. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=348.0s)]
*  I was crying for the kids. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=366.64s)]
*  More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military over the last year. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=374.96s)]
*  And at least 11,000 are children like Jude and Mohammed, according to Oxfam, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=381.28s)]
*  making it the deadliest conflict for children in a single year this century. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=386.64s)]
*  How much is too much, sir? At what point is it time to end this war? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=392.0s)]
*  Well, we'll end the war when we achieve our war goals of making sure that Hamas [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=396.47999999999996s)]
*  can't repeat such atrocities. I'm not going to change my policies, humanitarian policies, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  vaccination policies, combat policies, to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=404.88s)]
*  But is Israel any closer to achieving its war goals? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Even if we shall kill all Hamas activists and all the political leaders, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  and we shall destroy all the military installations, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=419.12s)]
*  we will not be able to achieve our goals. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=421.84s)]
*  On the day after, two Palestinian children that lost their families will try to achieve, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=423.84s)]
*  to get a knife and to kill Israelis, unless you will defeat the ideology. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=429.84s)]
*  And the only way to defeat the ideology is to present a better ideology. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=434.32s)]
*  And so one year later, is Israel safer than it was? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  No, no way. Israel is not safer because if you look on the day of tomorrow, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=443.03999999999996s)]
*  no one can tell you that we shall not face a regional war in which Hezbollah and Iran [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=451.2s)]
*  and the West Bank and Syria and the Houthis will not fight. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=460.48s)]
*  It will be a regional war with a global impact. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=465.76s)]
*  So nobody can tell you today that we are safer than on the 6th of October. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=469.36s)]
*  But for two mothers at the heart of this painful conflict, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  there is no time for it all to end. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=480.24s)]
*  There is no time for someone to finish words or something like this. They don't have time. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=491.6s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Kfaraza, Israel. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xqrp97E0LEs&t=500.40000000000003s)]
