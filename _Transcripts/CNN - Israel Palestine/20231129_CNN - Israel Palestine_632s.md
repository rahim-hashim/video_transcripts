# Retired colonel on what we can expect Israelis to do if truce ends
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM)
*  Israel is freed 180 Palestinians from prison over the first four days of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=0.0s)]
*  truce, mainly women and minors. Many of them were detained but never charged. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=6.26s)]
*  Prison service officials say that 30 were released yesterday. CNN's Ben [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=11.94s)]
*  Wiedemann is live force in Jerusalem. Ben, walk us through the diplomatic [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=15.8s)]
*  efforts to release more Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Where is that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  conversation now? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=25.14s)]
*  Well, that's part and parcel of the negotiations over the Israeli hostages [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  as well. And of course, tonight is the last day of the two day extension that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=34.68s)]
*  was agreed upon. And the diplomats are doing their best to try to work out a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  formula to extend it. We heard Majed Ansari, the spokesman for the Qatari [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=45.36s)]
*  foreign minister. The Qatari is, of course, the linchpin in these [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=50.32s)]
*  negotiations, saying that they are optimistic that a war, an agreement will [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=54.4s)]
*  be reached to extend it at least for two days. And of course, they are now [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=59.72s)]
*  looking beyond the next two days because officials negotiators say that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=65.34s)]
*  the number of women and Children currently being held in Gaza will be [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=71.6s)]
*  exhausted after two days. And then it's going to be a question of how do you [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=78.0s)]
*  deal with the civilian men and the Israeli soldiers who are in Gaza? And our [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=81.76s)]
*  understanding from the Qatari foreign ministry spokesman is that the next [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=89.0s)]
*  phase is looking at civilian Israelis being held inside Gaza. And we've seen, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=93.72s)]
*  for instance, yesterday, William Burns, the head of the CIA, was meeting with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=100.36s)]
*  Qatari Egyptian and Israeli officials in Doha. Clearly, they're looking beyond [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=104.44s)]
*  this phase, where the focus is on releasing women and Children in Gaza. And [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=110.64s)]
*  of course, the similar release of detainees and prisoners held in Israeli [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  jails. But at the moment, there still is no agreement for an extension. So there [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  always is that risk. If no agreement is reached, fighting could begin again. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  Boris, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=135.32s)]
*  Ben Widerman, thank you so much for that update. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  And right now, negotiators are racing to try to extend the truce between Israel [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=140.64000000000001s)]
*  and Hamas. The current deal expiring just hours from now. This is more [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=144.72s)]
*  hostages arrive in Israel after being released by Hamas. Two sources telling [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=149.16s)]
*  CNN that at least one American hostage is expected to be handed over in the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=153.68s)]
*  exchange today. Let's get more now. CNN's M. J. Lee. She is live for us at [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=158.16s)]
*  the White House. M. J. Tell us what you're hearing from the Biden [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=162.24s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=164.92s)]
*  Well, Brianna, the White House is certainly not commenting right now on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=167.22s)]
*  CNN's earlier reporting that an American is expected to be one of the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=171.44s)]
*  hostages free today. We are, of course, still waiting for that day six group of [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=175.96s)]
*  hostages to be released. If that were to happen, it would mark the second time [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=181.64s)]
*  that an American citizen is released during the course of this truce. But [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=186.88s)]
*  just to remind you what the White House had initially said they were hoping [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=190.96s)]
*  for and expecting was for three Americans to be released as part of the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=194.72s)]
*  initial group of 50 women and Children. Of course, we saw Abigail Adon, the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=200.0s)]
*  four year old Israeli American released on Sunday, but no word whatsoever from [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=204.44s)]
*  the White House so far on the two other women that were supposed to be released [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=208.84s)]
*  as a part of that initial 50. So we are still waiting for those hostages to be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=212.92s)]
*  released and we will learn whether one American women ends up being a part of [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=217.04s)]
*  that release. But again, no comment on that right now from the White House. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Part of this agreement, MJ, is that the International Red Cross is supposed to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=226.12s)]
*  get access to to check on the hostages that are still in Gaza, and that has not [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=230.84s)]
*  happened. Hamas is not allowed that. How is the U. S. Responding? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Brianna, part of the deal really was that the Red Cross officials would [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=240.2s)]
*  be able to go in and check on the hostages that are still being held in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=244.92s)]
*  Gaza, get a sense of how they're doing and really be able to report back on the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  status of some of these hostages. And that has not happened yet. And we know [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=254.44s)]
*  that U. S. Officials are among those that are pushing for this to happen [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=258.76s)]
*  because it was a part of the agreement. Of course, a lot of people are keen to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=263.36s)]
*  get a better sense of how these hostages are doing their conditions, their [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=267.2s)]
*  whereabouts. Really, we have so little information to work with right now. Our [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=271.36s)]
*  understanding and our reporting is that even though that does mark a violation [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=275.44s)]
*  in the agreement, that it's not at the point where that is about to derail this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=280.32s)]
*  deal, that it is still going to go on as long as hostages continue to be released. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=285.23999999999995s)]
*  But we saw a statement from the Red Cross president saying that they are ready to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  go in, but that they can't really forcibly do that unless they get [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=295.23999999999995s)]
*  permission to do so. Basically, they were saying if they sort of forced their [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=298.64s)]
*  way in to try to check on these hostages that that could end up actually [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=303.28s)]
*  endangering them. So that's just one more reminder of the sort of dangerous [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=307.28s)]
*  and tenuous circumstances that we're talking about here. Yeah, certainly [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=311.44s)]
*  alarming. And obviously officials want to get some information about those [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  who are still in Gaza. M. J. Lee live for us at the White House. Thank you, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  Boris. Meantime, according to senior administration officials, the U. S. Is [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=322.84s)]
*  urged Israel to be more precise in targeting Hamas in Gaza, especially in [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=327.52s)]
*  the south, where many civilians were told to flee for safety. The Palestinian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=332.04s)]
*  Ministry of Health in the West Bank says that nearly 15,000 people have been [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=336.48s)]
*  killed since October 7th. Tens of thousands more have been injured. Let's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  begin CNN military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Layton to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=345.28000000000003s)]
*  discuss Colonel. If Israel agrees to this U. S. Suggestion of a more [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=348.68s)]
*  targeted approach, what does that actually look like? So, Boris, there are [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=353.88s)]
*  a lot of different aspects to this, and precision is kind of in the eye of the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  beholder. What you're talking about here is when you look at the Israeli [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=361.7s)]
*  forces, the light blue is where their clearing operations have taken place. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=365.06s)]
*  So you're looking at the northern part of Gaza and the central part of Gaza, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=369.62s)]
*  kind of all around Gaza City. The dark blue shows that the furthest that this [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=373.38s)]
*  is the furthest point of advancement for the Israeli forces. Now, when you talk [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=378.26s)]
*  about precision strikes, let's do let's take a quick look at this video right [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=383.18s)]
*  here because I this is something that is not precise. What you're dealing with [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=387.98s)]
*  here is there are certain aspects of this where you can see where they struck [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=393.86s)]
*  certain areas, but all of this has been obliterated. That is an example of not [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=398.98s)]
*  really precision strike. This is more of a deliberate strike that goes across a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  wide area. The areas that you're talking about here are ones that, you know, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=409.54s)]
*  clearly have civilian applications. You see a washing machine right there. You [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=415.22s)]
*  see a hole right here where a bomb created right through this particular [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=418.86s)]
*  building. That's the kind of thing that if you target it directly, that is a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=422.78000000000003s)]
*  precision strike. But all this rest of this destruction is not emblematic of a [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  precision strike. Yeah, so precision being in the eye of the beholder, it [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=432.14000000000004s)]
*  appears that there's a difference between the U.S. definition of a precision [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=435.94000000000005s)]
*  strike and an Israeli one. Is that a fair assessment? That is a fair [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=439.46000000000004s)]
*  assessment because when the Israelis are looking at this, they really have [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  certain they're constrained by some of the weapons that they have, but they are [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  also constrained by the way in which they employ those weapons. And one of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=449.94s)]
*  the key things that they're doing is they believe that they need to take out [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=453.62s)]
*  a wide swath of this these areas. Because, for example, if you go into the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=457.3s)]
*  map of Gaza itself, all of this area right here was ordered to be evacuated. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=463.34000000000003s)]
*  And the reason for that is because of the strikes that we saw in the example [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=468.3s)]
*  of the video in con units. The rest of Gaza is also subject to these kinds of [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=472.94s)]
*  strikes, and that can really result in a lot of civilian casualties, even more [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=478.54s)]
*  than the 15,000 or so that may have been killed during this period. Colonel, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=483.18s)]
*  let's go back to that initial map because we're a few hours away from this [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=487.86s)]
*  sort of temporary truce potentially expiring their officials that are [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=492.82s)]
*  working to extend it right now. But if it does wind up expiring and hostilities [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=495.98s)]
*  resume, where do you see that playing out? So let's take a look right here at [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=500.21999999999997s)]
*  these areas right here, of course, where the Israelis have a presence right now. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=506.2s)]
*  What we can expect them to do is move into these areas right here into Gaza [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=510.22s)]
*  City, basically taking out every single thing that they can find in these areas. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=514.9s)]
*  They can do that potentially. They can also come in this way and cut off the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=521.46s)]
*  any retreat by Hamas from here into the south. The southern area is one in which [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=526.74s)]
*  they are hoping the Israelis are hoping to have kind of an area where they can [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=533.0600000000001s)]
*  put a lot of the civilian population. They've actually offered an area up as [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=537.26s)]
*  kind of a safe haven. But that is something that is very small, very small [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=542.14s)]
*  units, and it is an area that is really not conducive to keeping people there [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=547.82s)]
*  for a long time. And it's also not conducive to allowing for further [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=552.82s)]
*  military operations in this area because you could find a lot of Hamas fighters [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=557.98s)]
*  in an area like this as well. So Israel has kind of double challenges in this [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=562.38s)]
*  in this particular situation. When it comes to humanitarian aid, I want to go [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=566.78s)]
*  back to the video of con units because this, I think underscores the point that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=570.74s)]
*  is immense need among the civilian population in different parts of Gaza. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=574.5s)]
*  Obviously, this is just one example. What happens to the flow of humanitarian [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=578.66s)]
*  aid and the aid that's already in Gaza once hostilities resume? So the aid that [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAfHpIIPCCM&t=583.18s)]
