# Putin seizes on Israel-Hamas war to rally against US
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY)
*  No one is watching Israel's war against Hamas more closely than the Russian President Vladimir [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=0.0s)]
*  Putin, who is now trying to seize on the war to say that it is a battle between the United [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=4.92s)]
*  States and Israel versus the rest of the world. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=9.94s)]
*  Fred Plykken is out front. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=12.52s)]
*  As Israel's military continues its war against Hamas, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is framing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=18.12s)]
*  the conflict as part of a global struggle of America and the West against the rest [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=25.32s)]
*  of the world. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  It is the current ruling elites of the United States and their satellites that are the main [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  beneficiaries of global instability. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=37.68s)]
*  They extract their blood toll from it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=40.08s)]
*  While many nations around the world condemned Hamas after the October 7 raid on southern [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=43.72s)]
*  killing more than 1,400 and taking hundreds of hostages, including Russians, Russia invited [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=49.72s)]
*  a high-level Hamas delegation to Moscow for meetings, a top Hamas leader saying the group [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=57.22s)]
*  would give preference to captives from what they call their quote, Russian friends. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=62.76s)]
*  This request from Russia, we treat more positively and attentively than others due to the nature [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=69.28s)]
*  of our relations with Russia. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=74.56s)]
*  So far, no Russian hostages appear to have been released. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=78.72s)]
*  Still, Moscow not criticizing Hamas, instead ripping only into Israel for the many Palestinians [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=82.28s)]
*  killed by the IDF's ongoing aerial campaign in Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  Condemning terrorism, we categorically disagree that terrorism can be responded to by violating [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  the norms of international humanitarian law, including the indiscriminate use of force [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  against targets where the civilian population is known to be located. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=105.12s)]
*  But for years, it was Russia that waged a relentless bombing campaign against areas [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=112.44000000000001s)]
*  held by rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. and various international aid groups accused Moscow of deliberately targeting civilian [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=122.56s)]
*  areas, including hospitals and markets, killing and wounding scores, even though the Kremlin [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=128.0s)]
*  has consistently denied those claims. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=133.82s)]
*  And Russia's war against Ukraine continues. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=139.06s)]
*  Moscow once again harming civilian structures overnight in the port town of Odessa, wounding [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=141.9s)]
*  several people. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=146.78s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, though, trying to argue that Russia is invading Ukraine to help the Palestinians. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=149.26s)]
*  These are our soldiers and officers, and the choice of a real man, a real warrior, is to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=157.9s)]
*  pick up arms and stand in line with his brothers, be in a place where the fate of Russia and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=162.38s)]
*  of the whole world is being decided, including the future of the Palestinian people. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  Vladimir Putin there, Aaron, essentially trying to pit the entire rest of the world against [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=171.85999999999999s)]
*  the U.S. and its allies, including, of course, Israel as well. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=177.5s)]
*  And this is not new from Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=181.73999999999998s)]
*  Pretty much since he's invaded Ukraine, he's been speaking about wanting a new world order, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  as he puts it, one in which countries like China and Russia are much stronger and the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=189.46s)]
*  U.S. is weakened. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=193.9s)]
*  Aaron? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=195.18s)]
*  Fred, thank you very much. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=196.18s)]
*  And I want to go now to Barak Revi, the Axios Foreign Policy Reporter, longtime Israeli [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=197.5s)]
*  reporter as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=201.74s)]
*  All right, Barak, great to speak with you. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=202.74s)]
*  And obviously, you know, you hear Fred's reporting there and you've done extensive reporting [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=204.94s)]
*  on Putin and Russia's role here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=209.26000000000002s)]
*  What is Vladimir Putin doing here? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=211.44s)]
*  Hi, Aaron. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=214.38s)]
*  I think what we see from Vladimir Putin since the beginning of this war is something that, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=216.94000000000003s)]
*  at least from my point of view, was very unusual because for more than a decade, Vladimir Putin [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=223.34s)]
*  tried to maintain a close relationship with Israel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  And during this conflict, he just decided to throw Israel under the bus. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  And when you think about it, when you try and go like, you know, 30,000 feet up, you [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=241.74s)]
*  maybe know the reason why. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=248.02s)]
*  Because if you look at this war, I think the person who gets the most out of this war is [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=250.10000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin, where after the entire world attention was on his invasion to Ukraine, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=256.1s)]
*  now the entire attention of the international community is on the Middle East. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=263.98s)]
*  And it gets him a lot of air to do things without anybody watching. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=267.96s)]
*  And Fred showed that Moscow had invited top Hamas leaders to visit after the October 7th [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=275.12s)]
*  terror attacks, right? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=280.84s)]
*  So they made a point, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=281.84s)]
*  It's not just saying things between the lines. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=283.08s)]
*  It's an invitation, come visit us. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  But Barak, as you know, Hamas has been meeting with top Russian officials, including the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=287.67999999999995s)]
*  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  Hamas has been going on for years, including multiple times since Russia invaded Ukraine. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=293.24s)]
*  So what do you think all this means? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=299.48s)]
*  I mean, this is an investment over time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=301.68s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=305.72s)]
*  That's true. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=306.72s)]
*  But, and it's a big but, Vladimir Putin for years, one of his prides was that he takes [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=307.72s)]
*  care of Russian speaking people abroad. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=314.32s)]
*  He still sees them as part of Russia in another part of the world. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=317.88s)]
*  And Israel is a country where you have one million Russian speaking people. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=321.92s)]
*  And many of them were harmed in the October 7th attack. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=327.88s)]
*  And Putin didn't seem to care. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=333.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think that the fact that they invited the Hamas delegation a few days later, I think [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=335.78000000000003s)]
*  that was a clear message on which side Putin is on. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=340.44s)]
*  It's pretty incredible, though, the point that you point out, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=343.88s)]
*  One million Russian speakers. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=346.0s)]
*  And I think something many may not realize about Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=347.44s)]
*  And some of them, by the way, some of them are hostages in Gaza right now. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=354.76s)]
*  As he meets with Hamas. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=355.76s)]
*  In that context, in this interview that Prime Minister Netanyahu just gave to ABC News, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=357.92s)]
*  he says, I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, have the overall security responsibility [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  because we've seen what happens when we don't have it, referring to Gaza. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=366.88s)]
*  Now, we know his ministers have said that he's intimated this before, Barack, but he [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  puts the word indefinite on it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=373.44s)]
*  What do you see here? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=376.56s)]
*  I think that what we're going to see in Gaza is in many ways similar to what we see in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=380.0s)]
*  the West Bank in the last 15 years. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=385.2s)]
*  And this is that Israel keeps the overall security responsibility for itself coming [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=388.4s)]
*  every night into Palestinian cities to arrest suspects of terror activity. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=395.88s)]
*  Obviously, Gaza is not the West Bank. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  It's not going to be exactly the same. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=403.76s)]
*  But I think that when it comes to the policy, Israel would try to do the same thing it is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=405.28s)]
*  doing in the West Bank. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=413.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, in Gaza, again, after this operation will end, and who knows how long it's going [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  to take. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  All right, Barack, thank you very much, as always, for your perspective. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=425.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ3f0qxerKY&t=426.76s)]
