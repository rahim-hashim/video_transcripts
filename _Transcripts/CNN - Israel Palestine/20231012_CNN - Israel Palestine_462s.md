# 'It was animal slaughter': Israeli festival survivor describes horror
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg)
*  The infamous rampage through the outdoor music festival [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=0.0s)]
*  killed at least 260 partiers at least. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  Many are still missing and the stories keep coming out. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=6.4s)]
*  Sahar Ben Silar barely survived. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=9.8s)]
*  He's shown here dancing with friends [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=12.84s)]
*  just hours before the massacre. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  And I spoke to him from hospital in Tel Aviv [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=17.2s)]
*  and a warning too, his story is difficult to hear. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=19.64s)]
*  I want to make it clear first thing first. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=24.64s)]
*  It was a peace festival and we did nothing to provoke them. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=28.64s)]
*  We just was dancing and having fun. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  I can't forget the moment that when I got in the festival [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=37.2s)]
*  and I don't know anyone there, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=41.64s)]
*  it was something like 30 or 4,000 people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=43.96s)]
*  And just got into the entrance [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  and just a guy that I don't even know came to me [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=49.56s)]
*  and start to hug me and bless me [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  for coming for the festival. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  We had a small camp next to us of German people, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=56.24s)]
*  from German, just tourists, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  who came all over the way from Berlin or wherever they came. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=61.92s)]
*  And we make drinks together, we had laughs, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=65.64s)]
*  just so much happiness. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=68.88s)]
*  What happened to you? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=71.0s)]
*  Tell me how you got wounded. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=72.08s)]
*  I forget when I... [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=74.48s)]
*  It's a big story. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=75.60000000000001s)]
*  The first moment that we realized that there is missiles, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=77.76s)]
*  I was really calm in first [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=80.36s)]
*  because it's not the first time that I've seen missiles. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=83.2s)]
*  I was fighting in a Tzuketan [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=85.88s)]
*  and I was doing, I've been serving the army. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=88.24s)]
*  And then I start to watch the missiles [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=91.56s)]
*  and one of the producers of the festival [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=93.44s)]
*  just jumped on the fence [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  and screamed that the terrorists are coming in legs [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=98.75999999999999s)]
*  and leg just, they come in on land and not air from missile. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=101.36s)]
*  And then the panic began. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=105.08s)]
*  It was a big panic. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=107.08s)]
*  Everybody was jumping on the fence. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=108.36s)]
*  Everybody ran to their cars [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=110.24s)]
*  and it was a lot of fire out there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=111.84s)]
*  Even in the biggest war scene that we've seen in movies, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=115.6s)]
*  I can't explain how many bullets and missiles [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=120.04s)]
*  were flying around us. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=122.68s)]
*  Not the big missile, like RPG and everything. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=124.28s)]
*  It was RPG all over. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=127.8s)]
*  I was fighting in a war, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=129.72s)]
*  I've never seen so many RPGs, seriously. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=130.8s)]
*  And how did you get shot? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=133.2s)]
*  Saha, how did you get shot? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=135.36s)]
*  Part of the story. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=138.48s)]
*  We tried to go to another place [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=139.8s)]
*  and they turn us around again. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=141.52s)]
*  And then we saw a policeman standing next to a shelter [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=143.24s)]
*  and a lot of cars. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=146.32s)]
*  And the policeman look at us and say, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=147.76s)]
*  there is nowhere to run, they are all over the place. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=149.28s)]
*  Get inside the shelter, it's the only way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=152.04s)]
*  We got inside the shelters with something, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=155.04s)]
*  I remember 30 or 40 people, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=157.04s)]
*  but my friend says that was 60, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=158.68s)]
*  or even 50 or 60 peoples. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=160.72s)]
*  We got inside the shelter, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=163.92s)]
*  it was something like two meters at all. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=164.76s)]
*  Like just two meters square. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=167.84s)]
*  And we got inside and then the shooting started [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=170.64s)]
*  and the policemen tried to calm us down. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not the point, it was the IDF, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=176.76s)]
*  but the shooting was on us. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  I could see the shots, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=181.64s)]
*  I could feel on the stones of the shelter, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=183.28s)]
*  I could feel the bullets. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=188.32s)]
*  And we scared them, it's not IDF, it's not IDF. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=191.0s)]
*  And then just look at us and say, stay inside. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=194.32s)]
*  Pull out the gun and then it was a massive shots [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=197.72s)]
*  all over the place. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=200.96s)]
*  We can see in the entrance of the shelter, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  a lot of bullets flying inside, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=204.44s)]
*  but they couldn't hit us because they can turn left. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  That's because it was an entrance [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=209.44s)]
*  and then left to the shelter. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=211.0s)]
*  A small something like, even a half a meter. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=212.68s)]
*  Sahar, it sounds to me like you were directed [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=216.12s)]
*  to take shelter, but you were like a cornered animal [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=220.0s)]
*  in this shelter because that's where the- [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=223.4s)]
*  We didn't look shelter, it wasn't a shelter. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=226.32s)]
*  It was animal slaughter. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=229.84s)]
*  It's like they take all the animals to one place [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=232.44s)]
*  and shoot them all. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  And then the policeman got shot and ran away. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=236.44s)]
*  And he killed one of the terrorists, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=240.16s)]
*  but got shot and ran away. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=241.4s)]
*  I found him on Soroka Life and God, the policeman. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=243.2s)]
*  One second, sorry. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=249.0s)]
*  Then they dropped the first grenade. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  Drop inside, it was exploding the entrance. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=257.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, if it's too much, don't talk. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=264.2s)]
*  No, it's okay, I need to tell about this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=267.08s)]
*  Just a second, please. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=270.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=271.96s)]
*  After the first grenade, after something like 45 seconds, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=274.0s)]
*  he dropped the second grenade and he hit the wall, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=278.56s)]
*  hit my head and flowed to the back of the rope, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=282.08s)]
*  the people have been in the back row and explode on them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=286.28s)]
*  And there was something like a lot of smoke inside. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=290.32s)]
*  And my friend, girlfriend, they start to choke [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=293.96s)]
*  and she wanted to go out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=297.08s)]
*  And she start to run away from the shelter. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  We tried to catch her. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=300.76s)]
*  I remember I was in the second row of the people. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  I tried to catch her with my hand and it was slipping. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=304.48s)]
*  And she tackled, I think she tackled the terrorist [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=308.28s)]
*  and he shattered dead from zero, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=312.0s)]
*  from zero, how can I say? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=315.04s)]
*  Point blank. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=316.76s)]
*  Point blank. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=318.24s)]
*  Point blank, yes, thank you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=319.08000000000004s)]
*  From point blank. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=321.24s)]
*  And after he shattered dead, he just got inside. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=322.68s)]
*  I could never forget the face of him. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=326.96000000000004s)]
*  He was smiling at us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=329.16s)]
*  It looks like the devil. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=330.88s)]
*  He just looked at us, point the gun, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=332.48s)]
*  the Karlo machine gun in front of the girl face [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=335.04s)]
*  and just start to spread everything around. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=339.48s)]
*  All the people, I was in the second row. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=342.44s)]
*  All the people in the first row [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=345.08s)]
*  and the second row shot dead. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=346.36s)]
*  I just opened my eyes and opened my mouth [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=349.16s)]
*  and start to go down the wall [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=352.16s)]
*  because I got, I understood that I got hit [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=354.0s)]
*  but didn't understand where yet [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=356.68s)]
*  because it was blood all over and screaming. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=358.48s)]
*  And from all the adrenaline, I got hit in my body [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=360.96s)]
*  but I can't really understand what happens. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=363.64s)]
*  And I think his gun was broken. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=366.64s)]
*  That's why he stopped to shot. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=368.92s)]
*  And there was a third grenade inside the building [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=370.36s)]
*  but it didn't explode. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=373.48s)]
*  We found him on the floor. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  We say that we don't want to touch it so it won't explode. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=376.24s)]
*  You know what, Saha? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=380.12s)]
*  I'm just pleased that you made it out. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWu7zjxvOxg&t=382.04s)]
