# Retired colonel: This is the best option to respond to the killing of US troops in drone strike
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ)
*  We continue to follow the breaking news out of the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. is working to identify exactly which militia group carried out a deadly [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=2.64s)]
*  drone attack on a small U.S. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  outpost in Jordan that killed three U.S. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=8.58s)]
*  troops and injured more than 30 others. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=10.68s)]
*  This happening near the border with Syria and Iraq. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=12.98s)]
*  And joining me now to talk about this, seeing a military analyst and retired U.S. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=15.56s)]
*  Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton and former Middle East negotiator for the State [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=19.38s)]
*  Department, Aaron David Miller. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=22.96s)]
*  Colonel, I guess let me go to you first. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=24.96s)]
*  Your reaction to this deadly attack on U.S. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=26.76s)]
*  troops. There have been these moments that we've seen over the last several weeks [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=29.720000000000002s)]
*  where these Iran backed militias have been wreaking havoc, have been a nuisance [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  to U.S. forces in the region. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=40.14s)]
*  Obviously, this time it's it's much more serious and it may bring about a U.S. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=42.6s)]
*  response. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=46.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think it certainly will, Jim. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  And good to be with you again. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=50.64s)]
*  This is a really serious escalation at this point. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=51.78s)]
*  And what it has done because of the deaths of at least three American service members [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=55.36000000000001s)]
*  and the injuries of 30 more, 30 plus soldiers, it is clearly raising the ante here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=60.14s)]
*  And the group that did this, whichever one it was, is clearly asking for a response [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=68.98s)]
*  from the U.S. And what that, of course, means remains to be seen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, one of the key suspects here is probably Qatayib Hezbollah, the group in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=80.33999999999999s)]
*  Iraq that is an Iranian main Iranian proxy there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=86.41999999999999s)]
*  Could be one of the other Iranian proxies, but it clearly points to a possible escalation [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=89.82s)]
*  in that direction. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=95.32s)]
*  And before I go to Aaron, Colonel, just a quick follow up. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  Can you tell us more about this outpost known as Tower 22 in Jordan and the military [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=99.66s)]
*  installations that are located in that general area? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=106.0s)]
*  This sounds a bit of a remote outpost. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=109.42s)]
*  And I wonder if it raises the question about security at some of these installations where [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=112.86s)]
*  U.S. forces may be vulnerable to this sort of thing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=116.86s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly does raise a lot of security questions and, of course, force [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=121.04s)]
*  protection, as we call security in the military, is a key and dominant mission [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=124.72s)]
*  requirement for U.S. forces there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=131.04s)]
*  But this base, Tower 22, is right near the base of Al-Tanf, which is in Syria. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=133.72s)]
*  So Tower 22 is right on the Jordan-Syria border, but it's also close to what they call [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=138.82s)]
*  the tri-point where three countries come together, in this case Syria, Iraq and Jordan. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=145.14s)]
*  And because of that, it's in a unique position where it can oversee a lot of the smuggling [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=150.7s)]
*  routes that have been there for thousands of years between all of the different areas [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=156.34s)]
*  within Syria, Jordan and Iraq. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=161.5s)]
*  And it is at a very strategic location, has provided a lot of supplies to Al-Tanf, which is [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=163.9s)]
*  the primary base in this part of Syria that has been used against the ISIS forces that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=169.66s)]
*  we fought against over the last few years. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=177.5s)]
*  And, Aaron, President Biden has been briefed on the attack. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=180.66s)]
*  He's released a statement vowing to hold those responsible accountable. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=183.34s)]
*  We're already seeing calls from Republican lawmakers for a strike inside Iran. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  As a matter of fact, we talked to Congressman Adam Smith at the top of the hour, and he [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=192.78s)]
*  said that perhaps some sites in Iran should be considered for some sort of proportionate [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=196.42s)]
*  response. What might that do to the situation that obviously has been simmering with a lot [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=201.66s)]
*  of tensions over the last several weeks? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=207.58s)]
*  Obviously, things could get way more escalated if something like that happens. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=210.14s)]
*  You know, whether we're on the cusp, and thanks for having me, Jimmy, it's great to be here [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=214.78s)]
*  currently, whether we're on the cusp of a regional war or not, I don't know. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=217.78s)]
*  We're almost five months in. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=222.33999999999997s)]
*  February 7th will be the fifth month of this war. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=223.85999999999999s)]
*  And you're looking at controlled escalation to a large degree across the Israeli-Lebanese border [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=226.45999999999998s)]
*  and even these attacks against American bases and troops in Iraq and Syria. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  I think the administration on this one has options that run from bad to worse. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=239.06s)]
*  And I think there are only two options. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=244.42s)]
*  They're going to respond. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=246.26s)]
*  Question is, are they going to respond against Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps actual [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=247.74s)]
*  forces in Iraq and or Syria? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=253.46s)]
*  Or, as Adam Smith suggested, are they going to risk something that this administration [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=255.5s)]
*  and none of its predecessors have done? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=261.46s)]
*  And that is to strike Iranian assets in Iran proper, which for the Iranians is a self [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=263.54s)]
*  proclaimed red line. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=269.26s)]
*  Whether or not that proves to be the case, we may actually begin to find out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=270.94s)]
*  The other option, of course, is to strike fast boats and Iranian naval assets in the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=274.78s)]
*  Gulf. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=280.14s)]
*  But the administration understandably, given the regional hotspots that the Israeli-Iranian [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  war has generated, has a certain amount of risk aversion in their own responses. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=286.5s)]
*  I mean, they've responded actually to what, 160, 170 attacks since October. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  Maybe a tenth of those we've responded to. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=298.5s)]
*  I think on this one, however, you're going to see some you're going to see some fireworks. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=301.14s)]
*  And I think I still think we're not this is not going to trip the U.S. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=305.78s)]
*  and Iran into a major confrontation, but it certainly raises the stakes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=310.82s)]
*  Colonel, what do you think? Can the U.S. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=315.62s)]
*  hit Iran without hitting inside Iranian territory, as as Aaron is suggesting, and perhaps [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=317.34s)]
*  strike a balance that sends a message without getting things out of control? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=324.06s)]
*  I think it's imperative that the U.S. does that, Jim. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=328.18s)]
*  And, you know, as Aaron was pointing out, this is, you know, there are several options here. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=332.66s)]
*  Most of them are very bad. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=336.94s)]
*  But the best option of a bad series of choices is going to be to hit something that is very [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=338.42s)]
*  important to the Iranians. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=345.66s)]
*  But it is not something that strikes at the core of the regime or at the core of some of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=347.14s)]
*  their capabilities, but it would serve as a warning to them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=353.14s)]
*  So something like attacking naval assets in the Persian Gulf, something like that was kind [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=356.22s)]
*  of goes up to the line. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  But, you know, they could do that or they could stick with hitting the proxies in either [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=364.1s)]
*  Iraq or Syria. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=369.74s)]
*  But if there is a hand that is hidden, that is revealed for, let's say, the contact from [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=370.82s)]
*  Tehran that perhaps directed this attack, then they have to consider going all that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=376.82s)]
*  way to send a message to the Iranians. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=382.66s)]
*  And, Aaron, while all of this is unfolding, the president had sent the CIA director to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=386.22s)]
*  Europe in the hopes of reviving these hostage negotiations to get some kind of deal going [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=392.42s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas to simmer things down. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=396.38s)]
*  I wonder, do you think the Iranians were trying to blow this up? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=399.78000000000003s)]
*  They were trying to have an impact on this process? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=404.5s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=408.26s)]
*  And could this, I mean, could this get worse if we don't see a deal reached? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=409.26s)]
*  Well, it's definitely going to get worse. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=416.22s)]
*  It's going to get worse before it gets worse, I suspect. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=417.82s)]
*  But I, you know, I usually am pretty knowingly negative on these matters. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=421.18s)]
*  Bill Burns has a very close relationship with Mossad director David Barnea. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=425.54s)]
*  The Israelis actually, I think, are under an enormous amount of pressure, rising pressure [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=429.86s)]
*  from the hostage families, growing casualties, the IDFs understanding that they may well [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=434.66s)]
*  have reached the limit of the most intense kinetic phase. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=440.26s)]
*  And a pause, two months, which the Israelis could resume against the Hamas leadership [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=444.5s)]
*  would, in fact, do a couple things. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=451.1s)]
*  It would allow a surge, not a dribble, of humanitarian assistance, which is badly needed [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=454.62s)]
*  in the Gaza. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=459.22s)]
*  It would free the 100-plus hostages that remain. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=460.58s)]
*  And the return of the 20 or 30 that the Israelis believe are no longer living, either killed [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=464.38s)]
*  on October 7, their bodies taken to Gaza to trade for Palestinian prisoners or died [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=469.66s)]
*  in captivity, I think it would offer some respite, badly needed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=474.38000000000005s)]
*  Will what's happening with respect to this attack in Tantan derail that? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=480.58000000000004s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=488.14000000000004s)]
*  I think if Hamas and the Israelis both want to pause, then the U.S. is well positioned, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=489.3s)]
*  I think, right now to try to deliver one. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=495.82000000000005s)]
*  But remember, Middle East negotiations only have two speeds, Jim, slow and slower. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=497.58s)]
*  So this may take some time. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=502.97999999999996s)]
*  All right, Colonel Layden, Aaron David Miller, thanks so much to both of you. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=505.38s)]
*  Really appreciate the insights on an important night. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=508.46s)]
*  A lot of critical things happening, I think, in the next couple of days ahead. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=510.9s)]
*  We'll stay on top of it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=514.66s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=516.3s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkW0Xf3b3LQ&t=517.3s)]
