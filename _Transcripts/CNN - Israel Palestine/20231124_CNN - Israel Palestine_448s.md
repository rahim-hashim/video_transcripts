# Why you may not see Palestinians celebrating family members' return
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA)
*  For more on the Palestinian prisoners released as part of today's agreement, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to bring in CNN's Nimma al-Baghir is joining us from Jerusalem right now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=4.16s)]
*  Nimma, I understand you were outside a prison in Jerusalem [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=8.2s)]
*  where Palestinian prisoners were released and reunited with their families. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=11.4s)]
*  What did you see? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=15.84s)]
*  Well, Wolf, we weren't allowed to see anything. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Israeli authorities blocked off roads, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=21.8s)]
*  corralled the media into one location, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=25.0s)]
*  brought the Palestinians in through the back door when they received them, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=28.48s)]
*  and then only allowed family members to come [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=33.24s)]
*  in very limited single file in individual cars. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=36.04s)]
*  And there's a reason for that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=39.56s)]
*  Because unlike the images of celebration, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=41.24s)]
*  which you might have seen from Ramallah and the West Bank, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=45.0s)]
*  here in East Jerusalem, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=49.16s)]
*  Israeli authorities were better able to enforce [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=50.64s)]
*  the diktat of their far-right national security minister, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=54.28s)]
*  who has deemed the prisoners released today as terrorists. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  But not just that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=63.08s)]
*  He said any Palestinian who celebrates will themselves be charged as terrorists. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=64.16s)]
*  I mean, just to break that down a little bit, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=70.16s)]
*  there is no grounds to call them terrorists, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=73.36s)]
*  because by Israel's own reckoning, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  those 39 prisoners were 15 minors, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=78.0s)]
*  10 of whom were only charged, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  and 24 women, 23 were detained, not charged, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=85.0s)]
*  and 10 of the minors were detained, not charged. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=90.68s)]
*  It complicates telling this story. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  So imagine your daughter has come home to you, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=95.48s)]
*  and you have to hide indoors to express your joy. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=98.92000000000002s)]
*  I want to show you this video, Wolf, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  of a daughter reuniting with her mother that was sent to us by the family. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=105.0s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=110.48s)]
*  THEY CRY [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  THEY CRY [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=116.0s)]
*  THEY CRY [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=119.0s)]
*  THEY CRY [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=122.0s)]
*  THEY CRY [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=125.0s)]
*  THEY CRY [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=128.0s)]
*  That young lady you see there, the reason... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=129.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no reason, it's her daughter, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=133.0s)]
*  but beyond that, she had been arrested at the age of 16, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=135.92000000000002s)]
*  convicted at 17 for 10 years, accused of attempted stabbing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=141.0s)]
*  Her family and her lawyer and Israeli and Palestinian rights groups [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  say that this was a miscarriage of justice. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=151.2s)]
*  Her family had taken this all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=153.76s)]
*  and her mother had lost hope. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=158.44s)]
*  So the idea that Israel's far-right figures [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=160.68s)]
*  are demonising Palestinian joy in this moment [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=164.64s)]
*  is part of a bigger picture, Wolf, that we have seen play out [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  where they're not distinguishing between Hamas and civilians, Wolf. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  We have seen today in the Occupied West Bank [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=176.44s)]
*  thousands of people gathering around these centres [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=179.28s)]
*  where these Palestinian prisoners have been returned to, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=182.68s)]
*  released and reunited with their family members. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=186.44s)]
*  We saw so many people gathering on the streets today [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=189.32s)]
*  celebrating that release. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  It certainly is a welcome step, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=193.56s)]
*  but we also have been hearing from some on the ground, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  including the family members of some of those released, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  who told us that for them, this isn't a moment [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=200.76s)]
*  where they can be totally happy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=202.88s)]
*  because of what they have seen unfold in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=205.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, this has been seen as a welcome step, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=208.84s)]
*  and of course, this is the first batch of prisoners [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  set to be released over the next four days. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=214.56s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=217.6s)]
*  A joyous celebration as 23-year-old Malak Sulaiman [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  finally arrived home in East Jerusalem [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=225.28s)]
*  after six years in an Israeli prison. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=228.16s)]
*  Convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  at the age of 17 for attempted murder. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=234.24s)]
*  Police say they found a knife in her possession [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=237.64000000000001s)]
*  near the old city of Jerusalem. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=240.28s)]
*  It is a charge she and her family have long denied. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=242.28s)]
*  Sulaiman is one of 39 prisoners, all women and minors, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=248.96s)]
*  released from jails in Israel on Friday [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=253.84s)]
*  in exchange for the release of two dozen hostages [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  who had been held by Hamas in Gaza. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=260.12s)]
*  We saw many of those detainees now released, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  those prisoners now released rather, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=265.56s)]
*  being carried on people's shoulders [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  to the municipality building [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=269.48s)]
*  where a number of their family members were waiting. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=270.76s)]
*  As he mentioned, among them, 15 minors who were released [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=273.24s)]
*  being carried up this road on people's shoulders [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=277.2s)]
*  to much cheering and celebration, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=279.8s)]
*  even fireworks being set off. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=281.68s)]
*  We've also been speaking to people, including relatives, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=284.44s)]
*  who say they didn't want to see these crowds. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=287.44s)]
*  This celebration is not necessary. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=290.76s)]
*  They need to be mindful of us in Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=292.76s)]
*  This celebration is wrong. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=295.03999999999996s)]
*  I am torn to pieces. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=296.68s)]
*  Have a little mercy on us. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=298.4s)]
*  They can be joyful, but the joy is in the heart [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=300.28s)]
*  because we are dying in Gaza. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=302.56s)]
*  Have some respect for us a little. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=304.52s)]
*  The release of this first group of Palestinian prisoners [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  comes as Israel and Hamas begin a four-day truce, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=310.8s)]
*  a window of desperately needed respite [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=314.92s)]
*  for civilians in Gaza. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=317.36s)]
*  According to Hamas-run health authorities in Gaza, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=319.32s)]
*  nearly 15,000 Palestinians in the enclave [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=322.56s)]
*  have been killed over the last seven weeks alone. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=325.72s)]
*  Israel says it is targeting Hamas [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=330.72s)]
*  in response to the terror attack of October 7th, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=333.36s)]
*  which killed more than 1,200 Israeli citizens. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  But in Gaza, it is civilians that are paying the highest price. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=339.8s)]
*  More than 8,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli jails, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=344.88s)]
*  including more than 3,000, according to the Palestinian Commission [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=349.12s)]
*  for Detainees and Ex-Prisoners Affairs, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=352.72s)]
*  held under administrative detention, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  meaning no clear charges and no clear legal process. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=357.88s)]
*  But for those gathered in the occupied West Bank on Friday night, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=362.52s)]
*  this is a welcome moment of, in their eyes, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=366.04s)]
*  long-overdue justice. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=369.48s)]
*  People want to gather and be together in this moment. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  And however folks internalise that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=375.04s)]
*  in terms of their own emotional sort of reaction to it, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  that's for them to speak to. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=380.88s)]
*  But I think people want to be here to be together, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=383.76s)]
*  to welcome home these prisoners. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's part of the spirit of being Palestinian. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=388.12s)]
*  With over 100 Palestinian prisoners still set for release [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=391.48s)]
*  over the next few days, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=394.88s)]
*  scenes like this are expected to continue, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=396.64s)]
*  though some say at too high a price. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=399.96s)]
*  Of course, Wolf, it is important to note that we are expecting [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=406.52s)]
*  some 150 Palestinians to be released from prison [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=409.08s)]
*  as part of that deal over the next four days, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=412.08s)]
*  if indeed that truce is upheld. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=414.28s)]
*  And according to a list seen earlier this week by CNN, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  the vast majority of those prisoners listed for potential release [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=419.59999999999997s)]
*  were young people, children under the age of 18, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  amongst them many teenage boys between the ages of 16 to 18, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=426.72s)]
*  charged with minor offences, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=431.36s)]
*  including throwing stones at Israeli prisoners. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=432.72s)]
*  Now it's unclear who exactly will be released [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=435.8s)]
*  over the next coming days. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voXlir19xpA&t=438.92s)]
