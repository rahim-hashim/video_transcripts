# Fareed shares what the 'severest setback' would be for Hamas now
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg)
*  Here's my take. Hamas' brutal and inhuman attack on Israel last week took the world by surprise. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=0.0s)]
*  Most importantly and tragically, it took the Israeli government by surprise, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=8.64s)]
*  which meant a delayed response to the slaughter of its civilians. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=13.36s)]
*  But this was no black swan event. Instead, as the scholar Amy Zegart notes, it was a white swan, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=17.92s)]
*  something utterly predictable. This is the fifth war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=26.0s)]
*  over the last 15 years. Israel controls air, land and sea access to the Strip. Israeli intelligence [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=32.72s)]
*  is supposed to have an extensive network of informants in Gaza. So what happened? We'll [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=39.6s)]
*  need time to reach a full assessment, but it does appear that the Netanyahu government was so focused [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=46.8s)]
*  on judicial overhaul at home and a Saudi deal abroad that it ignored the possibility of an [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=52.16s)]
*  upheaval in Gaza, despite allegedly receiving warnings from Egypt. Professor Dmitry Shumsky of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=58.4s)]
*  Hebrew University writes more provocatively that for years Netanyahu developed and advanced a [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=65.92s)]
*  destructive warped political doctrine that held that strengthening Hamas at the expense of the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=73.28s)]
*  Palestinian Authority would be good for Israel. This approach divided the Palestinians, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=79.84s)]
*  undermined the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and made it easy for Netanyahu to claim [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  there was no path to a Palestinian state. Shumsky cites a Jerusalem Post report that at a Likud [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=91.04s)]
*  party meeting in 2019, Netanyahu made clear that he supported the money that the Qatari government [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=97.84s)]
*  was sending to Hamas. That way, Bibi is reported to have said, Israel would foil the establishment [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=104.32s)]
*  of a Palestinian state. Tal Schneider references the same meeting and also notes that most of the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=110.63999999999999s)]
*  time Israeli policy was to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=117.52s)]
*  like Israel's current finance minister once asserted. The Netanyahu government was pursuing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  a policy premised on the notion that it could ignore the Palestinian issue and make a deal [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=131.28s)]
*  directly with the Gulf Arabs who were increasingly nervous about Iran's rise in the region and eager [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=136.08s)]
*  to tie up with Israel's booming technology-driven economy. The assumptions behind that strategy [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=142.32s)]
*  exploded last week. But there is a broader backdrop for last week's terror attack. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=149.52s)]
*  For the last two decades, the Middle East has been shaped by Washington's actions. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=155.68s)]
*  Above all, by the Iraq war and the subsequent withdrawal of American power. The war upset the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=160.64s)]
*  delicate balance between Iran and the Arabs and the Shiites and the Sunnis. When the U.S. toppled [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=167.44s)]
*  Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated government in Baghdad, Iran gained unprecedented influence in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=173.52s)]
*  Iraq, which is majority Shia. Then began the American retreat from the Middle East, which [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=180.4s)]
*  left a vacuum in the region into which many players entered. Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=187.12s)]
*  Russia and Israel, each trying to promote its own interests. We think of the world as having [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=193.76s)]
*  been reasonably stable for these last two decades until Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=200.08s)]
*  But that is not true of the Middle East, where the last two decades have been particularly bloody. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands died in Iraq. Then came the Syrian civil war, which displaced more than 14 [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  million people and killed still more hundreds of thousands. That was followed by a war in Yemen, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  which quickly became the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. And in all of these crises [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=225.04s)]
*  and conflicts, regional players have picked sides, trying to maximize their advantages and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=230.56s)]
*  bleed their foes. We're seeing a worldwide contest between the forces of order and disorder. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=236.0s)]
*  Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas are trying to erode the international system. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=243.04s)]
*  If Hamas succeeds, it will encourage others, Hezbollah, the Houthis, to flex their muscles as [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=249.44s)]
*  well. Defeating Hamas is a daunting challenge. That terrorist group is hoping for a massive [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=255.76s)]
*  Israeli overreaction that produces thousands of civilian casualties and bogs down Israeli troops. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=262.96s)]
*  Hamas is also hoping for the collapse of any possible deal with Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=270.56s)]
*  The more brutal Israel's response, the more likely it is that that deal will collapse. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=275.52s)]
*  Israel's goal should be to respond to Hamas, deal with the Palestinian issue in a way [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  that still allows for the resumption of negotiations on Saudi normalization. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=287.52s)]
*  That is the strategic prize. The establishment of normal relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=293.2s)]
*  would be the severest setback for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=300.24s)]
*  One lesson is clear. The United States cannot walk away from the Middle East entirely. It can [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=306.72s)]
*  force-worn military interventions and it can recognize the centrality of Asia, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=312.48s)]
*  but it needs to remain politically and diplomatically active in the region. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=317.76s)]
*  American engagement is a stabilizing force in the world. For those unconvinced, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  look at the emerging post-American Middle East. Go to cnn.com slash Fareed for a link to my [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI0810gD6Eg&t=329.36s)]
