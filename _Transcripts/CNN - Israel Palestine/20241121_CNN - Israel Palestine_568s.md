# ICC's first prosecutor explains whatâ€™s next for Netanyahu after arrest warrant
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc)
*  Luis Moreno Ocampo is a lawyer who served as the first prosecutor of the ICC from 2003 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=0.0s)]
*  to 2012. Rosa Friedman is Professor of Law, Conflict and Global Development at the University [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  of Reading. Good to have you both. Before we get into the mechanics, sir, let's start [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=14.44s)]
*  with you. Can you just take us through what has been going on in the months since we got [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=21.68s)]
*  the news that the chief prosecutor was seeking these arrest warrants? I mean, these are controversial. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=29.92s)]
*  There is an enormous amount of pressure on the ICC at present. The Israelis calling this [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=39.28s)]
*  decision absurd and anti-Semitic. Others who support this decision by the ICC suggesting [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=47.44s)]
*  it is not at all political and should be adhered to. Luis Ocampo, your sense, if you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=55.02s)]
*  will, just walk us through how we got to this point and the sort of pressure that the ICC [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=61.34s)]
*  is under at this stage. Well, start with the crimes because it's very limited to the starvation [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=66.38s)]
*  part of the campaign. The ICC is not making findings or bombing or genocide. It's just [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=74.38s)]
*  a very limited charge starvation. And everyone knows starvation happened because Mr. Galan [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=82.1s)]
*  openly said from the beginning they would do it. And President Biden spent one year [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=89.38s)]
*  begging to Israel to let food and water to go. So the facts are non-controversial. And [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=95.02s)]
*  the legal characterization was, okay, it's a war crime of starvation. And the judges [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=103.53999999999999s)]
*  said you cannot use starvation to attack civilians to combat Hamas. And that's very clear. Israel [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=108.66s)]
*  can stop this tomorrow, Becky. Israel can stop this tomorrow. How? If Israel start today [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=116.86s)]
*  a real investigation against Prime Minister Netanyahu, the case will be stopped in the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=124.9s)]
*  ICC, because the ICC act when the national country does not act. So in no go to political [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=130.26s)]
*  consideration, Israel wants to stop this? Well, do the cases yourself. That's it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=136.14s)]
*  Well the US, and I quote here, just crossing the wires now, fundamentally rejects the ICC [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=144.94s)]
*  arrest warrant decision and is discussing the next steps. We know that in discussion [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=151.42s)]
*  over the past months these next steps could include sanctions against the ICC. Rosa, before [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=157.86s)]
*  I come to you, Luis Ocampo, your response. Well, President Biden was begging Prime Minister [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=164.58s)]
*  Netanyahu not to commit crimes. And now he said, okay, but I don't care what he said. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  I think it was a mistake. But I think President Trump is a very smart person. So he will find [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  alternatives. Because it's ridiculous that the US goes against the world, exposes itself [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=188.4s)]
*  protecting crimes, when Israel can stop this tomorrow. Prime Minister Netanyahu knows very [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  well that he can stop this tomorrow just allowing a national investigation in Israel. So why [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  the US will go ballistic against the world when it's an easy solution for this open investigation [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=207.84s)]
*  in Israel? So I think it's something to consider. The US leadership will be seriously compromised [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=214.24s)]
*  here if the US tries to attack the ICC. Because the world is with the ICC in this case. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=221.28s)]
*  This administration, of course, has only got two months left to run. But it's very likely [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=230.88s)]
*  that these threats of sanctions against the ICC to completely sort of discredit the ICC are likely [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=236.24s)]
*  to come from a Donald Trump administration in spades. Rosa, let me bring you in. Luis, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  I'll bring you back in in a moment. Let's just talk about what these arrest warrants practically [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=250.32000000000002s)]
*  mean. What are the next steps here? So the arrest warrants have been issued. But remember, Israel is [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  not party to the International Criminal Court. So Israel is not under any duty internationally to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=265.52s)]
*  send Galant or Netanyahu to the court. What it does mean is that if they were to travel to any of the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=271.84s)]
*  124 states that are party to the ICC, they could be arrested. Those states should arrest them [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=279.12s)]
*  and send them to the Hague. We have seen in the past that arrest warrants have been issued, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  and people have traveled with those arrest warrants into ICC state parties and not been [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=290.96s)]
*  arrested. So it's a political as well as a legal decision. But the next stage will really be what [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=295.68s)]
*  the court decides to do. Now, it can't try an absentia. It needs to have Galant and Netanyahu [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=302.88s)]
*  in front of it in order for any trial to take place. And let's be clear, these are arrest warrants [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=309.91999999999996s)]
*  that have been issued. They've not decided that there's enough evidence to prosecute and to find [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  them guilty. We have to have due process. We have to have a fair trial. They're simply saying that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=320.64s)]
*  they think there is sufficient evidence to arrest them or, as my colleague was saying, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  for a national investigation to take place. Could and should, were two words that you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=331.28s)]
*  used there, could and should if Benjamin Netanyahu and or you have Galant travel to a country [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=341.44s)]
*  that is signatory to the Rome Statute, that is the statute that set up the ICC, if they traveled [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  there, they could and should be arrested. But as you rightly point out in the past, there have been [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  those with arrest warrants who have not been arrested in these countries. There is no mechanism, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=361.44000000000005s)]
*  is there, to actually arrest anybody who is under warrant from the ICC, correct? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=367.6s)]
*  Well, the mechanism would be that they would be arrested if they were, they could be arrested [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=375.44s)]
*  if they were in a country that was part of the party, kidnapped and taken to the Hague from Israel, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=379.52000000000004s)]
*  which is not a state party. And really what's been said by the Americans, just to chime in on [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=385.68s)]
*  the question you asked my colleague, what's been said by the Americans is this issuing of an arrest [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=392.24s)]
*  warrant for a democratically elected leader as compared with all the other democratically [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=396.72s)]
*  elected leaders that, for example, went into Raqqa, and Mosul recently to fight ISIS or Tony [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=401.44s)]
*  Blair and George Bush for the Iraq war and things like that, looks like a politicized decision. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=406.88s)]
*  So it actually probably will be a political decision of each country that's party to the ICC [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=412.16s)]
*  whether they uphold these arrest warrants or not, given how contentious they are. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=418.08s)]
*  Right. These arrest warrants are against Netanyahu and Galan for crimes against humanity [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=423.04s)]
*  and war crimes committed from at least the 8th of October 2023 until at least May 2023. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  That is the day that the prosecution filed the application for warrants of arrest. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=440.72s)]
*  Luisa Campo, you said all that needs to happen is that Israel stops what are described, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=445.84000000000003s)]
*  you know, in these arrest warrants as crimes against humanity at present. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=453.04s)]
*  Are you suggesting that if the war stopped tomorrow, if there were a ceasefire tomorrow, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=456.72s)]
*  that the ICC would not pursue this case any further? I just want to be quite clear about [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=463.28000000000003s)]
*  where you stand. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  Stopping the crimes is necessary, but we're not enough to stop the investigation. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=470.88s)]
*  To stop the investigation, to stop the arrest warrants, it's needed to start an investigation [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=475.2s)]
*  in Israel. So a criminal prosecutor in Israel or a commission of inquiry in Israel investigating [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=482.08s)]
*  Netanyahu for crimes against humanity and war crimes. That is the measure to stop that. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=488.08s)]
*  And that's why for me, I don't think this is politically, because it's not political. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=493.84s)]
*  I don't think this is politically, because the court also indicted President Putin. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  The court could indict Maduro. So the court is in the U.S. you see as friends or enemies. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=503.12s)]
*  The court sees as criminal or not criminals. That is a different standard. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=510.72s)]
*  And so that's why I think it's very important for President Trump to understand, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  okay, if you want to do something with Maduro, the court could help you. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=518.64s)]
*  So don't kill, don't try to attack the court. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=522.88s)]
*  And also, when you say about legitimacy, I think the who is losing legitimacy here will be the U.S. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=525.04s)]
*  attacking the court. Because when you see the discussions in the world, the world is incredibly [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=532.56s)]
*  sad what happened in Palestine. So the idea to stop this is important. And until today, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  President Biden did not have zero influence. So I think what we need now is to stop the crimes, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=547.36s)]
*  stop the bombing, and solve the issue of Netanyahu, please, organize an investigation in Israel. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=554.48s)]
*  That is legally will make the ICC stop the case. That has to be very clear. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xnRv8ue6Mc&t=562.48s)]
