# CNN reporter embeds with IDF in Gaza. Here's what he saw
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI)
*  Tonight, CNN is getting a closer look at Israeli military operations in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=0.0s)]
*  CNN reported from Gaza under Israel Defense Forces escort at all times, and as a condition [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=5.44s)]
*  for journalists to embed with the IDF, media outlets must submit footage filmed in Gaza [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=11.34s)]
*  to Israeli military for review. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=17.54s)]
*  CNN did not submit its script to the IDF and had editorial control over the final report. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=20.46s)]
*  This is Aaron Leiberman, live from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=26.82s)]
*  Tell us what you saw. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=31.42s)]
*  Well, first, it's nearly impossible to get into Gaza to report. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=33.42s)]
*  You can't get in from the Israeli side as a reporter or from the Egyptian side. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=37.86s)]
*  So the chance to see what was happening was given to us by the IDF, who took us in with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=41.38s)]
*  a tank about a mile deep into Gaza to see what was happening on the ground. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  Not only the progress they say they're making, but also the challenges they face in a war [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=50.18s)]
*  that is very much hot. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=53.74s)]
*  Through the breach, we enter northern Gaza at the Erez border crossing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=56.82s)]
*  The land here, once fertile farmland, is barren, and the trees that might have provided enemy [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  cover destroyed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=68.06s)]
*  In the distance, smoke from an Israeli airstrike is a stark reminder that this is day 34 of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=70.02s)]
*  a war that may stretch much longer. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  On Thursday, the IDF chief of staff and the head of the country's internal security service [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=78.58s)]
*  entered Gaza and promised strength through cooperation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=82.54s)]
*  Everyone is doing everything, said General Herzl Alevi, just so you can be as strong [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=89.54s)]
*  as possible. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  Along our path in northern Gaza, the signs of civilian life have given way to the constant [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  hum of drones and the distant echoes of artillery. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=103.22s)]
*  Our time with the IDF began at the coordination base for the border crossing, the first international [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=107.7s)]
*  media to visit the site. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=112.5s)]
*  The terror attack on October 7th hit hard here, the scars of machine gun fire and RPGs [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=114.14s)]
*  still visible. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=120.18s)]
*  The base was mostly empty on the holiday, but not entirely. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=121.54s)]
*  The IDF says nine soldiers were killed here and three kidnapped. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=125.3s)]
*  It took 12 hours for Israel to regain control of the base. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=129.22s)]
*  Now it's one of the main gates to Gaza. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=132.94s)]
*  A month into the war, more than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=136.7s)]
*  according to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry there. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=141.9s)]
*  The IDF says 35 Israeli soldiers have been killed in the strip since the start of the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=147.78s)]
*  incursion. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=152.3s)]
*  The October 7th attack by Hamas in Israel killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=153.66s)]
*  We stop at an overlook near the town of Jabalia. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=162.42000000000002s)]
*  One of the things uncovered here on this hill near Jabalia is a meeting point of three different [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=165.46s)]
*  tunnels. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=170.57999999999998s)]
*  And you can see if you take a look, that's one, two, three. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  They came together here and it let Hamas move underground quickly below the feet and out [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=175.66s)]
*  of sight. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=180.26s)]
*  Colonel Tal, the tank commander, says there were many explosives here, there were many [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  trenches, there were a lot of weapons and ammunition. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=187.7s)]
*  We found here a storage site with many explosives against tanks, RPGs. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=190.54s)]
*  Even from a distance, the scale of the destruction is stunning. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=194.94s)]
*  Apartment buildings, homes, neighborhoods, decimated. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=198.66s)]
*  Colonel Tal says the area is almost completely evacuated. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=206.78s)]
*  We don't see civilians in our eyes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=210.18s)]
*  We see sometimes terrorists, but the majority of civilians haven't been here in a while. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=211.94s)]
*  They've all gone south in the direction of the heart of the strip. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=215.86s)]
*  As we talk, we hear rocket fire and see the trails of the launches, triggering red alerts [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  in Ashdod. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=223.54s)]
*  After about 90 minutes inside northern Gaza, we make our way out, hugging the border wall [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=226.02s)]
*  for safety. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=229.94000000000003s)]
*  Even here, so close to the exit, we stop briefly so the dust clears and we can make sure the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=231.38000000000002s)]
*  way ahead is safe. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=235.58s)]
*  In the distance once again, the smoke from another strike. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  The IDF spokesperson said the ground operation in Gaza will only deepen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=243.5s)]
*  As Israel said, it has largely encircled Gaza City and is moving towards the heart of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=248.0s)]
*  city in its ground operation. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=252.22000000000003s)]
*  Wolf, I also spoke with the tank commander about the humanitarian corridor that we've [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=253.94s)]
*  talked so much about earlier today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=257.1s)]
*  And he said they're aware of the humanitarian corridor. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=259.3s)]
*  It's not his job to coordinate it, but he knows when it is and where it is. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  And even in the middle of a war, he knows you don't shoot in that direction, even as [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=265.7s)]
*  the war rages around them in other parts. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=269.46s)]
*  Orin Lieberman in Tel Aviv for us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=273.1s)]
*  Orin, thanks for that report. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=274.54s)]
*  And joining me now to discuss all the news out of the Middle East, the National Security [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  Council coordinator for strategic communications, retired Admiral John Kirby. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=281.62s)]
*  John, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=286.26s)]
*  First, I want to get to Israel's daily four-hour pauses that are now being reported in [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=288.38s)]
*  northern Gaza to allow civilians to flee south. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=293.58s)]
*  How will these pauses actually work? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=297.06s)]
*  And have the Israelis fully committed to them? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=299.26s)]
*  They have fully committed to them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=302.14s)]
*  And the way it's going to work is about three hours before the pauses will begin. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=304.06s)]
*  The Israelis will, through a variety of means, notify civilians living in northern Gaza that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=307.74s)]
*  the pause is going to start. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=313.5s)]
*  And here's when. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  And also advise on the safest corridor, the safest passage out. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=316.02000000000004s)]
*  They've added now a second safe passage corridor, humanitarian corridor, they call it, out of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=320.86s)]
*  northern Gaza along the coast road. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=326.82000000000005s)]
*  So that's one more than they had before over just the last few days. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=329.14000000000004s)]
*  Now, this is a step in the right direction, Wolf. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=332.82000000000005s)]
*  I mean, this could help reduce civilian casualties by giving people the confidence and the time [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=334.9s)]
*  to move out of harm's way and not find themselves in the crossfire between Hamas and the Israeli [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=341.09999999999997s)]
*  Defense Forces. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=345.82s)]
*  But, John, even with these brief pauses, is there really anywhere in Gaza that's safe [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=346.82s)]
*  for Palestinian civilians? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=352.94s)]
*  And we're told almost half of them are children. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=355.14s)]
*  Well, Hamas is placing those children and those families in harm's way by tunneling [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=357.78s)]
*  under their apartment complexes and using their hospitals and schools as command bunkers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=363.14000000000004s)]
*  Hamas is placing these civilians deliberately and directly in harm's way in between the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  IDF and Hamas. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=373.54s)]
*  And so these safe corridors and these pauses, this breathing space and time for people to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=375.42s)]
*  get out should help alleviate some of the anxiety and the worry that so many innocent [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=381.06s)]
*  Palestinians are feeling every day in north Gaza. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pTpWBAXOuI&t=387.06s)]
