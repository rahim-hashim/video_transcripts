# Israel resumes combat operations against Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo)
*  When we do begin with breaking news this morning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=0.0s)]
*  the truce between Israel and Hamas is over. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=1.9000000000000001s)]
*  Once again, explosions are rocking Gaza, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  and giant plumes of smoke are rising over that skyline. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  Fighting started just minutes after the seven-day truce [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=11.6s)]
*  expired at midnight Eastern time. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Israel accused Hamas of breaking the deal by firing a rocket. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=17.62s)]
*  The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=22.06s)]
*  says today's strikes have already [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=24.42s)]
*  killed at least 32 people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=25.82s)]
*  And this is the aftermath of a strike [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=28.22s)]
*  in southern Gaza this morning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=29.96s)]
*  So what happens now? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=32.0s)]
*  Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=34.0s)]
*  the key intermediary here, says negotiations [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=35.24s)]
*  are still underway to pause the fighting once again. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=37.94s)]
*  Mistakes could not be higher. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=40.84s)]
*  What about the remaining hostages? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=42.64s)]
*  Israel says 137 are still believed to be in Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=44.28s)]
*  Senior U.S. official says before the truce fell apart [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  in the final hours last night, Hamas was claiming [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  it did not have any more women or children [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  hostages to exchange. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=56.58s)]
*  Israel says that's not true at all. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=58.18s)]
*  Same official tells me Hamas didn't even submit [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=60.18s)]
*  a list of hostages for potential release last night. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=62.62s)]
*  So what happens now to the civilians in Gaza? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=65.92s)]
*  The Biden administration is pressuring Israel [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  to help protect Palestinians. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=70.16s)]
*  The Secretary of State on the ground yesterday [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=71.8s)]
*  talking about exactly that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=73.74s)]
*  CNN's Oren Lieberman starts us off this morning [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=75.1s)]
*  live in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  Oren, the IDF is already dropping leaflets [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=79.0s)]
*  in parts of southern Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=81.0s)]
*  What do we know about the scale of the combat operations [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=82.84s)]
*  that are underway right now? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=85.62s)]
*  Phil, both Israel and Hamas had indicated [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  they were ready to restart fighting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=90.88s)]
*  if the negotiations fell apart and if the truce expired. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=92.28s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=95.36s)]
*  right around seven o'clock this morning. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=96.46s)]
*  We have seen the skyline of Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=98.0s)]
*  We have heard the strikes the IDF is carrying out in Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=99.6s)]
*  So this war is very much back on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=103.1s)]
*  as both Israel and Hamas had promised. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=105.46s)]
*  We have seen Israel carrying out strikes in southern Gaza [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  according to authorities there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=110.84s)]
*  That is where they said they would focus [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=112.4s)]
*  the second phase of their operation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=113.94s)]
*  According to health authorities in Gaza, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=116.34s)]
*  at least 32 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=117.82s)]
*  in the first hours of the resumption of fighting. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=120.61999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel has dropped leaflets [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=123.5s)]
*  in parts of southern Gaza. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=125.6s)]
*  Interestingly, those leaflets have a QR code [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=126.89999999999999s)]
*  that brings you to a map with Gaza broken up [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=129.5s)]
*  into very tiny parcels. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=131.34s)]
*  It seems as if Israel will try to evacuate [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=133.14s)]
*  these parcels of civilians [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  along established evacuation routes [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=137.34s)]
*  in an attempt to avoid civilian casualties [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=139.38s)]
*  as the fighting resumes at pace. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=141.62s)]
*  Worth noting that Secretary of State Anthony Blinken [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=143.88s)]
*  was just here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=145.92s)]
*  He said Israel had to have a concrete plan [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  to protect civilians before they launch [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  the second phase of their operation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, that is now here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  He also said Israel needed a plan [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=154.78s)]
*  for more humanitarian assistance. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=156.22s)]
*  And yet aid trucks outside of Gaza [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=158.02s)]
*  that have already been inspected by Israel, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=159.96s)]
*  according to an eyewitness on the ground there, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=162.3s)]
*  have not gone in since this morning. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=164.22s)]
*  So, Phil, it is very much a question [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  of whether that humanitarian aid has now been cut off [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=167.74s)]
*  with the fighting resumed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=170.3s)]
*  And what about negotiations? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=172.0s)]
*  I mean, are they ongoing or not the pace [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  that they were to extend this from four days to seven days, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=176.10000000000002s)]
*  or have they stopped as well? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=179.16000000000003s)]
*  Poppy, negotiations are ongoing, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=183.68s)]
*  according to Qatari and US officials. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  The effort's still very much there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=188.18s)]
*  It's worth remembering that we got to the truce [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=189.62s)]
*  through negotiations in the middle of fighting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=192.24s)]
*  The real question, why did they break down? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=194.68s)]
*  Israel clearly believes there are enough women [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  and children held by Hamas in Gaza [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=199.02s)]
*  to continue for at least a day longer. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=201.5s)]
*  Hamas, not clear that they agree with that sentiment. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=204.02s)]
*  They blamed Israel for a breakdown in negotiations, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=206.78s)]
*  saying they were ready to begin talks on the other groups, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=209.02s)]
*  elderly women, as well as soldiers, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=211.86s)]
*  women and men, to continue the truce [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=213.98s)]
*  and to release more of the hostages. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=217.26s)]
*  They're looking for a bigger deal here, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=219.5s)]
*  and that's what the international community [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=221.34s)]
*  is pushing for as well. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=222.74s)]
*  But with no list handed to Israel of women and children [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=224.62s)]
*  that could be released, the fighting has once again started. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=227.22s)]
*  We'll see if possible and how long it might take [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=230.26s)]
*  to get to another point where there is another pause. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=232.3s)]
*  Orin Lieberman and Tel Aviv, thank you very much. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=235.9s)]
*  And let's bring in CNN Military Analyst, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=238.3s)]
*  retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton for more. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=240.26s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=243.1s)]
*  So Israel is now dropping these leaflets [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=243.94s)]
*  on the southern city in Gaza, of Khan Unis, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=246.38s)]
*  which we should note, by the way, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=249.86s)]
*  is located south of the line of Wadi Gaza [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=252.14s)]
*  that was driven, that was before, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=255.22s)]
*  where, remember, all the residents were told [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=257.28s)]
*  to evacuate from the north to the south. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=259.98s)]
*  So now they're dropping leaflets in Khan Unis [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  that say this is a fighting zone, evacuate immediately. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=265.68s)]
*  What do you believe the IDF is about to do? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=269.2s)]
*  So, Poppy, good morning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  What we're seeing here are basically movements [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=273.08s)]
*  down to the south. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=275.82s)]
*  So Khan Unis is right about here, excuse me, right down here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  And what that does is it shows that they're trying [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=280.56s)]
*  to move everybody into this area. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  If you look at this map right here, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  this is the damage map that we've seen [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  with the previous strikes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=291.84s)]
*  So right in this area, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=293.28s)]
*  that's where most of the damage has occurred [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=295.0s)]
*  in the northern part of Gaza. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=297.12s)]
*  There's some damage also in the central part, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=299.52s)]
*  but Khan Unis and the area around Rafa, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=301.96s)]
*  they've had minimal damage. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=305.76s)]
*  But what they're trying to do is they're trying [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=306.97999999999996s)]
*  to move everybody into the southern areas. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=308.4s)]
*  And so along these evacuation routes right here, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=311.46s)]
*  the Saladin route and the coastal road right here, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  Wadi Gaza is the dividing line. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  The northern part is their military zone. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=320.76s)]
*  At least it has been up until now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=323.2s)]
*  Now they're moving into the southern part. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=325.0s)]
*  And we believe that they're going to try [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=326.68s)]
*  to have some areas right in here that are areas [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=328.68s)]
*  where they're going to bring the civilian population [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=331.78s)]
*  into them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  But having said that, they're also going [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=334.78s)]
*  to be moving their military forces in this area. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=337.44s)]
*  The IDF will be doing that probably as part [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=339.7s)]
*  of their next phase of operations. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=342.2s)]
*  Colonel Aitken, can we take a step back? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=344.34s)]
*  We've spoken so often over the course [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=345.7s)]
*  of the last couple of days about the intensive [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=347.21999999999997s)]
*  behind the scenes talks, US officials trying [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=348.92s)]
*  to press their Israeli counterparts to scope, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=351.14s)]
*  shape, be precise about the operations in the south. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=354.52s)]
*  Why are they targeting the south? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=357.42s)]
*  So the reason they're targeting the south, Phil, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=360.14s)]
*  is that right in this area, they believe [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=362.18s)]
*  that all of the Hamas fighters are basically moving in here. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=364.62s)]
*  There are some obviously that are going to stay [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=368.46s)]
*  in the north, although it's extremely damaged. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=369.86s)]
*  But in the south, they're expecting them to be there. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=372.68s)]
*  And so what the Israelis are doing is basically [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=375.40000000000003s)]
*  called shaping operations. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  These shaping operations are designed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  to move people in certain directions. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=381.6s)]
*  There are two types of people that the Israelis [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  are worried about here, the refugees, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=386.08000000000004s)]
*  the civilian population, but for them, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=388.28000000000003s)]
*  more importantly from a military perspective, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=390.88s)]
*  the Hamas fighters. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  And they believe that those fighters will be moving [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=394.48s)]
*  in these areas as well to blend into the civilian [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  population and to try to avoid being struck [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=399.44000000000005s)]
*  by the Israelis. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=402.24s)]
*  Colonel Sergeant Clayton, we appreciate it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=404.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=405.54s)]
*  You bet. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  21 year old Mia Shem was one of the final hostages [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=407.3s)]
*  released in those last hours of the truce. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=410.22s)]
*  Oh, dear, I see me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=414.18s)]
*  That is her being reunited with her mother [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=421.26s)]
*  and her brother at an air force base in southern Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  And you can see her in this video. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=426.54s)]
*  This is before, and this is her exiting a car [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  being handed over to the Red Cross to be taken back home. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=432.48s)]
*  What you're looking at there, that's her mother, right? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=440.72s)]
*  The moment she found out about her daughter's release. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=442.7s)]
*  Mia attended the Nova Music Festival on October 7th. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=445.98s)]
*  That is where she was kidnapped by Hamas militants. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=448.78000000000003s)]
*  A little more than a week later, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  Mia appeared in the very first hostage video. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=452.56s)]
*  You'll remember that, released by Hamas. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=454.94s)]
*  Her arm severely wounded and bandaged. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  Now she is back home. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=459.42s)]
*  Well, this morning we are getting new reporting [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=462.82s)]
*  about the Biden administration's attempt [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=464.5s)]
*  to shape Israel's next phase of the offensive in Gaza, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=465.94s)]
*  a phase that appears to be very much underway [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=469.21999999999997s)]
*  now that those talks to extend a pause have fallen apart, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=471.38s)]
*  at least for the moment. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=474.14s)]
*  A senior State Department official says [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=475.26s)]
*  that Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=477.14s)]
*  made three hard requests while he was on the ground [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=478.46s)]
*  in Israel yesterday. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=481.17999999999995s)]
*  You see him there speaking with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=482.02s)]
*  also met behind closed doors with Netanyahu [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=485.05999999999995s)]
*  and his war cabinet. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=487.38s)]
*  Those three critical elements continue to expand [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  the current surge, continue and expand the current surge [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=491.76s)]
*  of humanitarian aid. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=495.2s)]
*  It has been a central focus. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=496.28s)]
*  There has been a major surge during the pause [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  in hostilities. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=500.03999999999996s)]
*  They want that to continue. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=500.88s)]
*  Second, trying to find new ways to have humanitarian pauses, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=502.48s)]
*  either by extending the hostage swap agreement [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=505.24s)]
*  or through other pauses, both for aid and for those hostages. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=508.56s)]
*  And third, a clear and unambiguous plan [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=512.48s)]
*  to minimize civilian casualties and suffering in the South. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=514.56s)]
*  CNN political and national security analyst David Sanger. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=517.9s)]
*  David, I want to start with that last because this has kind [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=520.9s)]
*  of been dual-track to some degree. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=524.6600000000001s)]
*  There have been the intensive discussions and negotiations [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=526.26s)]
*  that were trying to extend the pause that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=529.5s)]
*  had been in place, the hostage swaps. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=531.94s)]
*  And then there have been a second track of US officials [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=533.86s)]
*  working with, talking to, and pressing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=536.94s)]
*  their Israeli counterparts about what [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=540.1s)]
*  this operation in the South will look like. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=541.7800000000001s)]
*  How much leverage do they have here? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=544.74s)]
*  Well, good morning, Phil. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=548.84s)]
*  The main piece of leverage that the US has [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=550.62s)]
*  is that Israel is using US weapons [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=553.94s)]
*  and is going to Congress, or the administration [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=556.9s)]
*  is going to Congress, for an additional $14 billion [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=560.5s)]
*  in aid. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=563.82s)]
*  And one of the debates underway in Congress right now [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=564.1800000000001s)]
*  is, would there be conditions placed on that aid? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=566.5s)]
*  And of course, something you write in the law [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=569.6600000000001s)]
*  could be a lot clunkier than something [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=571.7s)]
*  that the Secretary of State can negotiate out [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=574.14s)]
*  with the Israelis. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=577.54s)]
*  But if you just back this up over, say, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=579.16s)]
*  the past seven weeks or so, we've [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=581.92s)]
*  gone from the president saying, I'm unambiguously [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=584.88s)]
*  behind Israel, to the president saying, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=588.0799999999999s)]
*  do not make the mistakes that we made, the excesses that we [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=591.04s)]
*  made after 9-11, to the Secretary of State in his visit [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=594.48s)]
*  saying, there are far too many Palestinians being killed, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  to now the State Department saying, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=603.7199999999999s)]
*  here are three specific conditions. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=605.68s)]
*  So they are trying to put the squeeze on the Israelis, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=608.42s)]
*  in part, by making public exactly what these demands are. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNMsk3a5USo&t=611.26s)]
