# See what CNN reporter saw inside hospital basement in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA)
*  CNN's Nick Robertson and his crew got an up-close view of the ash, the bullets, the trail of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=0.0s)]
*  absolute destruction. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=6.68s)]
*  The rare inside look at how the IDF is fighting comes at a consequential moment in this war, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=8.4s)]
*  as the American president says that the Strip's main hospital must be protected. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=15.0s)]
*  Now, Israel says the very same facility houses a Hamas command complex below it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=19.76s)]
*  And CNN reported the story that you're about to see under Israeli Defense Force escort [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=26.06s)]
*  at all times, but CNN did not submit its script or its footage to the IDF. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=30.82s)]
*  And CNN retained editorial control over the final report that you'll see now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=36.18s)]
*  Driving into Gaza with the Israeli forces. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=43.66s)]
*  It's a war zone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=47.78s)]
*  The conditions of our access only show officers, no faces of soldiers and don't show sensitive [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=49.74s)]
*  equipment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=57.14s)]
*  We are passing mile after mile of destruction. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=58.34s)]
*  Buildings blown, collapsed, nothing untouched by the fury of Israel's hunt for Hamas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=63.38s)]
*  Streets here crushed back to sand. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=71.66s)]
*  Shops, everything that we see. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=74.98s)]
*  No sign of any civilians here and the soldiers have been telling us that even inside the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=77.34s)]
*  stores they've been fighting things like rocket propelled grenades ready to use against them [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=82.34s)]
*  as they were advancing through this area. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  A few miles in, we pull up at a command post. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=92.38000000000001s)]
*  Soldiers living in blown apartment buildings. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  Every building I'm looking at here, wherever you turn, is destroyed, it's shot up. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to imagine how civilians endured the bombardment here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=105.66000000000001s)]
*  Our next journey much deeper into Gaza. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=110.7s)]
*  We arrive a hundred meters from a battle with Hamas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=114.26s)]
*  Tanks blasting targets in nearby buildings. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=123.42s)]
*  The IDF's top spokesperson waiting for us. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=126.98s)]
*  We're now conducting an operation inside Gaza next to Rantisi Hospital. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=130.54s)]
*  Israel is facing massive international pressure over the destruction of homes, the shockingly [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=136.62s)]
*  high civilian death toll and in the last few days over its apparently heavy handed tactics [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  at hospitals. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=151.26s)]
*  We are searching the tunnel with the bulldozers to reveal the tunnels that we suspect that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=152.26s)]
*  underneath the hospital. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=158.9s)]
*  Gary has brought us here to show the connection he says exists between Hamas and the Rantisi [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=160.54s)]
*  Children's Hospital. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=168.86s)]
*  We're now here in an area between a hospital, a school and a terrorist house. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  A Hamas commander he says lived there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=180.46s)]
*  He points out the solar panels on the roof. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  This is a tunnel that was sliding like this, the floor. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=187.14s)]
*  You can see here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=190.7s)]
*  This is the ladder going down. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=192.1s)]
*  You see the ladder going down. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=193.1s)]
*  I see the ladder going down. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=194.1s)]
*  This is a 20 meter tunnel. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=195.1s)]
*  And look at here. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=196.1s)]
*  Look at the panel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=197.1s)]
*  Look at the careful here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=198.1s)]
*  But look down here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=199.1s)]
*  The cables are going down to the tunnel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=200.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=209.1s)]
*  So they're hard wired into the tunnel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=210.1s)]
*  The solar panels on the terrorist house provide electricity directly to the tunnel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=213.1s)]
*  We've entered a robot inside the tunnel and the robot saw a massive door, a door that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=221.66s)]
*  is on the direction of the hospital. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=229.42s)]
*  We're in what is an active fire zone here. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=231.82s)]
*  You can hear the small arms fire. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=234.38s)]
*  The IDF say they're still clearing this area out. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=236.54s)]
*  We're getting down here. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=239.62s)]
*  Just taking a bit of cover because they said we're still taking fire. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=240.62s)]
*  But over here we were able to smell what smelled like rotting flesh. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=244.54s)]
*  Bodies perhaps buried underneath the rubble. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=248.78s)]
*  No, no, don't go up, Hay. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=251.58s)]
*  Don't expose yourself. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  As we move off to the hospital, a hundred meters away, we're still taking fire. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=255.5s)]
*  We're still conducting an operation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=260.58s)]
*  Operation conducted by a special unit. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=263.42s)]
*  The Israeli Navy SEALs are researching the hospital. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=265.98s)]
*  Megari later tells us he took a big risk, bringing us into such a combat zone. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=269.06s)]
*  It is clear he wants this story told. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=276.1s)]
*  We're searching here to see the connection of the tunnel to the hospital, okay? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  Don't fall here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=284.26s)]
*  So this is where the connection... [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=285.26s)]
*  We are looking for the connection. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=287.14s)]
*  As we finally reach the hospital, it is already getting dark. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=288.9s)]
*  A huge hole has been blasted through the walls into the basement. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=293.78s)]
*  Why is the hospital so damaged? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=298.66s)]
*  We'll talk about why is the hospital so damaged. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=300.94s)]
*  I'll explain. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=302.94s)]
*  It's a very important question. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=303.94s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=304.94s)]
*  We came to this hospital five days ago. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=305.94s)]
*  There were still patients inside the hospital. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=309.46s)]
*  We did not enter into the hospital. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=311.18s)]
*  He claims since then all patients were evacuated by hospital staff. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=313.14s)]
*  We assist this evacuation, of course, to make it a safe pass for all the patients in the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=318.98s)]
*  hospital. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=322.98s)]
*  We do not know that the hospital is entirely clean. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=324.06s)]
*  We do not know. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=326.66s)]
*  We entered to this area which was suspected because we were being fired. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  Gary leads us through a warren of basement corridors to this room. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=332.62s)]
*  This was the armory, okay? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=339.02000000000004s)]
*  This was the Hamas armory. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=341.18s)]
*  He shows us a few rusting guns and some explosives. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=343.22s)]
*  These guns alone have potentially huge implications for Gaza's hospitals and Israel's apparent [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  push to take control of them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=355.38s)]
*  The International Committee for the Red Cross say that hospitals are given special protection [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=357.78s)]
*  under international humanitarian law in a time of war. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=362.97999999999996s)]
*  But if militants store weapons there or use them as a base of fire, then that protection [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=366.94s)]
*  falls away. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=371.94s)]
*  In other rooms, he shows us a motorbike with a bullet hole in it that he suspects was used [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  by Hamas attackers October 7. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=379.34s)]
*  And nearby, possible evidence hostages could have been held here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=382.46s)]
*  We are now in the basement in the same area, yards from the motorcycle. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=388.14s)]
*  We see her chair, we see her rope. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=391.7s)]
*  We see her, a woman's clothes or a woman's something covering a woman. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=395.14s)]
*  She think a woman was tied up in this chair. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=399.65999999999997s)]
*  This is an assumption going to be checked by DNA. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=401.82s)]
*  More evidence, Higari says, points towards Hamas and possible hostage presence below [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=404.7s)]
*  the hospital. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=410.58s)]
*  And by bringing us here to this hospital and showing us the connection that you believe [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=411.62s)]
*  exists between the terrorists and the possibly hostages, what does this say about the other [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=415.5s)]
*  hospitals here in Gaza? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=420.38s)]
*  Cynically, Shifa Hospital is known by facts, by intelligence, to be a terrorist hub. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=422.65999999999997s)]
*  And also it's suspicious also in holding hostages. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=428.02s)]
*  This is the best shelter for the terror war machine of Hamas. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=431.02s)]
*  But the hospital authorities said they have no knowledge of Hamas or other groups inside [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=434.38s)]
*  the hospitals. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=438.53999999999996s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=439.53999999999996s)]
*  I think it's not possible for a hospital to have this kind of an infrastructure. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=440.58000000000004s)]
*  We knew the terrorists were here. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=444.34000000000003s)]
*  We knew. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=446.54s)]
*  How did you know? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=447.54s)]
*  We knew by intelligence and also we got some fire from this area. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=448.54s)]
*  From this area of this building? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=451.38s)]
*  From this area. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=452.38s)]
*  And we were right to fire because we found an armory. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=453.38s)]
*  But so much damage all around here. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=457.1s)]
*  Yeah, there is damage all around here because Hamas made it impossible for us to fight him. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=458.86s)]
*  He built all this infrastructure in tunnels and in hospitals around areas populated. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=465.5s)]
*  As we exit the hospital, it is already dark. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=472.14s)]
*  We're just getting ready to leave right now. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=475.14s)]
*  The firefight is still going on. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=477.34s)]
*  Still intense. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=479.5s)]
*  Bullets fired. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=480.5s)]
*  Explosions going on off the street there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=481.5s)]
*  This war and the controversies surrounding it, far from resolved. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=483.41999999999996s)]
*  Nick Robinson, CNN, Gaza. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP6raWKH7DA&t=489.46s)]
