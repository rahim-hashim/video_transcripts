# Volunteer Israeli medic recounts horror of Hamas attack
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8)
*  For two weeks now, Israel and Gaza have been at war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel and Hamas have been at war. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  And the region is confronting all the horrors [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=4.92s)]
*  of what that actually means. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=7.62s)]
*  I wanna bring in Naomi Galliano, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  volunteer medic with United Hatzelup. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=11.52s)]
*  Now Naomi, on the afternoon of the Hamas attack, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=14.68s)]
*  and I just want everyone to know [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=17.44s)]
*  when they're looking at you now, you're at work. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=18.44s)]
*  You're out saving lives, that's what you do. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=20.7s)]
*  Yeah, I know you are. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=24.18s)]
*  So I really appreciate you just taking a few minutes [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=25.2s)]
*  to talk to us, because I know that you want the world [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=27.66s)]
*  to know and to be very aware of what happened [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=30.3s)]
*  and you think it's important. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=32.84s)]
*  That day, on the afternoon of the Hamas attack, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=34.42s)]
*  you were on call looking for anyone who survived. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=37.18s)]
*  You were getting those calls. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=40.74s)]
*  You were going to the Gippot Zimal on that border. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=41.94s)]
*  How do you even cope with what you saw? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=45.66s)]
*  Before we even talk about what you saw, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=48.8s)]
*  how do you cope with it now, Naomi? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=50.3s)]
*  So right now, thanks to United Hatzelup [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=53.28s)]
*  and other organizations in Israel, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=57.64s)]
*  I have a full psychological treatment every other day, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=60.04s)]
*  special treatment of, it's called EMDR. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  It's a system that works on the brain [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=68.16s)]
*  that helps you cope with traumatic events [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=71.08s)]
*  before you develop post-traumatic symptoms. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=73.84s)]
*  So I have that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=79.12s)]
*  Well, I'm very glad that you're gonna be able [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=80.2s)]
*  to do that. You're getting me. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=82.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=84.16000000000001s)]
*  Naomi, I know that you witnessed horrific things [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=85.64s)]
*  with your own eyes as you were trying to save lives. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  I know that, again, you have chosen to talk about this [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=91.72s)]
*  because you don't want the world to be able to turn away [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=94.72s)]
*  and forget what happened, what you saw with your own eyes. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  What do you want people to know about what you saw? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=103.2s)]
*  The first thing that I want them to know [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=106.78s)]
*  that probably is Hamas is ISIS. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=108.62s)]
*  The act and the horrific things that we saw [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=112.62s)]
*  are beyond words, beyond anything we could compare to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  or any movie or any horror movie [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=120.62s)]
*  that you could ever, ever imagine seeing or anywhere. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=125.34s)]
*  Begin with the babies that we saw, dead, bleeding, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=131.34s)]
*  beheaded, to the women that we saw in the same situation, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=135.02s)]
*  the same poses, the blood, the elderly. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=139.22s)]
*  Take your piss, everything. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=145.74s)]
*  Naomi, I have, I think along with many others, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=152.38s)]
*  it felt frustrating to see the people [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=155.86s)]
*  I think along with many others, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  it felt frustration that beheading became a part of this, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=159.78s)]
*  that the horrific things that everyone knows occurred, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=163.17999999999998s)]
*  that why that would be something that needed to be proven [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=166.22s)]
*  when so many horrific other things also happened. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=169.1s)]
*  But I just want to be clear that you did see those acts. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=173.5s)]
*  You did see people who had been beheaded. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=178.54s)]
*  Fortunately, I have seen that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=183.73999999999998s)]
*  I've seen people that their limbs been taken out. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=186.76s)]
*  I've seen mothers dead on top of their babies [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=192.16s)]
*  that were also dead. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=196.2s)]
*  I've seen burned bodies of young girls, young men, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=198.0s)]
*  people of all ages, babies, burned babies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=205.32s)]
*  You just burned them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=208.88s)]
*  I can't even start to describe the smell [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=211.6s)]
*  but at the beginning, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=214.12s)]
*  you don't even realize what you're smelling. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  It smells like barbecue. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=217.8s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=220.76000000000002s)]
*  It's the type of smell. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=221.96s)]
*  And when you take a little bit closer, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  both sides of the skin, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=229.16000000000003s)]
*  you realize that it is burned meat [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  and it's people. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=234.56s)]
*  And it's something that I don't think I will ever be able [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=237.04s)]
*  to raise for my head or for my mind or for my dreams. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Noemi, was there anyone that was in a position [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  that you were able to help them when you got there? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=256.36s)]
*  It was, I don't know, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=262.56s)]
*  it was around, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=265.68s)]
*  it took us so much time [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=270.32s)]
*  till we found people that were actually alive. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=272.04s)]
*  And when we did, we were able to help, yeah, thank God. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=274.64s)]
*  But compared to the dead people and the amount of dead, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=278.04s)]
*  it wasn't a lot. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=281.08s)]
*  It wasn't a lot. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=283.44s)]
*  But yes, we were able to save few families from Bery. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  That we loaded the ambulance with four or five injured [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=289.16s)]
*  at the same time, because there was no time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=293.8s)]
*  We were under fire and we have to load the ambulance [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=295.44s)]
*  with as much injured as we can. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  And they were severely, severely injured in their lungs [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=300.76s)]
*  because they breathed smoke for at least three or four hours [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=303.48s)]
*  because the terrorists, Hamas, burned their houses [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=308.68s)]
*  once they realized they cannot go into the safe room. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=311.72s)]
*  So they just burned the whole place down. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=315.64s)]
*  And the families that stayed inside, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  some of them were alive and we were able to help them [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=319.68s)]
*  and save them and some of them not. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=323.36s)]
*  My God, the fact that some of them were alive [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=329.56s)]
*  and you were able to save them, I mean, what a miracle. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  What a miracle that is. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=334.56s)]
*  I mean, Naomi, obviously this is how you reacted [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=336.32s)]
*  in a moment that no one can comprehend being in. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=339.04s)]
*  You reacted by going in. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  You talk about being under fire [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=343.56s)]
*  as you're trying to save people. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=345.68s)]
*  Did you realize that you could have died? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=347.88s)]
*  Did you realize that this was all still happening [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=350.12s)]
*  while you were there? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=352.0s)]
*  Did you even process it? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=352.84000000000003s)]
*  At that time, you don't stop to process it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=356.2s)]
*  You just think, I'm here. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=358.68s)]
*  I'll do my best to stay alive [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=361.8s)]
*  because I have to save more life. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=363.44s)]
*  I have to get back to my family. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=365.68s)]
*  So even you're under fire, try the best as you can [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=368.0s)]
*  to stay alive if it's lying on the floor, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  if it's try to hide behind cars, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  if it's staying really, really quiet, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  even though with your ambulance, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  even though you're driving through the night, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=382.2s)]
*  but you don't turn the light on, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=383.84s)]
*  you drive in complete, complete darkness [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=386.2s)]
*  because you know, if you stay alive, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=389.52s)]
*  then you could save more life. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=391.92s)]
*  And that's what you do hour after hour. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's what you do. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=401.04s)]
*  I think so many of us, I listened to you [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=402.24s)]
*  and it's truly unbelievable. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=403.92s)]
*  It's an inspiration that is hard to even comprehend [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=407.64s)]
*  and you're still doing it, Naomi. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=410.88s)]
*  You're still going out. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=412.16s)]
*  You're still able to work now. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=416.48s)]
*  Well, I took a few days off this past week. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=417.76s)]
*  Now I'm back here. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=420.32s)]
*  I'm in Ashkelon right now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=421.16s)]
*  I have my crew with me, my ambulance [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=423.16s)]
*  on the other side over here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=425.24s)]
*  I have my ambulance behind me. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes, I see you trying to show me. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=430.64s)]
*  Right now I can't be inside the ambulance. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=431.48s)]
*  I can't be inside the ambulance. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=434.04s)]
*  We have to be outside. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=435.88s)]
*  We have safe places here because if there's any alarm on, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=436.88s)]
*  we have to go into the safe place. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=439.48s)]
*  And only when it stops, we could go out [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=441.20000000000005s)]
*  and start see if we could rescue people [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=443.8s)]
*  and hoping that no one got hurt. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  That's our best hope. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=449.16s)]
*  Well, Naomi, I wanna thank you very much. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=453.36s)]
*  Before you go, I just wanna ask you a very simple question, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  which is now that you've taken the time [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=460.48s)]
*  to share these horrors and to relive them [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=462.36s)]
*  because you want people to hear that, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  is there anything else you wanna tell anyone watching [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=467.04s)]
*  about what's happening in Israel, about how you feel? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=469.68s)]
*  Is there anything else you just want the world to hear? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=473.08000000000004s)]
*  I just want the world to know that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=477.8s)]
*  these things should never happen again. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=481.08000000000004s)]
*  You should know that Hamas is ISIS. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=482.92s)]
*  The acts that we saw are against any humanity [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=485.48s)]
*  that could possibly be existing in this world. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=488.92s)]
*  And go home to your families and hug your kids [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=492.72s)]
*  and love them and be with them. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=495.8s)]
*  Because from what I saw, maybe you could never know [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=498.52000000000004s)]
*  if it's the last day or the last moment [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=501.48s)]
*  and just tell your family that you love them every day. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=504.36s)]
*  And if you're in a situation, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=508.72s)]
*  try to do your best to help others [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=511.24s)]
*  because sometimes even the smallest help [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=514.04s)]
*  could change the world for someone else. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  Naomi, thank you very much. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=521.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=524.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=526.6s)]
*  Nehemiah Galeano, as you can see, in Ashkelon Israel, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=528.36s)]
*  out, EMT out right now, going to save lives, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=531.08s)]
*  even after what she has endured [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=534.5600000000001s)]
*  and taken the time and agony to share with all of us. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0NQFeLzsd8&t=535.96s)]
