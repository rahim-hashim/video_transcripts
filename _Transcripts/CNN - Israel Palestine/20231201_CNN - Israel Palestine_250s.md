# Burnett confronts top Israeli official about October 7 intelligence failure
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE)
*  According to the New York Times, Israel obtained Hamas's battle plan for October 7th more than [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=0.0s)]
*  a year in advance. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=6.28s)]
*  And I've seen some of the documents myself. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the ones I saw were dated October 2022. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=9.76s)]
*  The Times points out that the Hamas documents that they saw are shockingly close to reality. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=13.76s)]
*  They called for a barrage of rockets at the outset of the attack. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Hamas did that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=23.44s)]
*  They called for breaking through the wall. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=24.44s)]
*  Hamas did that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=26.76s)]
*  They called for entering via paraglider. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=28.28s)]
*  Hamas did that. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=30.64s)]
*  They called for entering via motorcycle. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=32.08s)]
*  Hamas did that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=34.08s)]
*  Mark, do you know why this document was dismissed? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=35.4s)]
*  Well, it's clear there was an amazing mishap, a failure. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=39.32s)]
*  There's no excuses for it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=47.84s)]
*  And we have to look into this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=50.2s)]
*  We paid for our mistakes on October 7th in blood, in the blood of over 1,200 Israelis [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  who were murdered and another 240 that were kidnapped and taken to Gaza. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  So we have to take this very seriously. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=64.92s)]
*  We can't accept such a failure. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  We pride ourselves as Israelis for having excellent intelligence services. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=70.68s)]
*  In this case, maybe the information there, it wasn't understood. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=75.88s)]
*  It didn't go up the chain like it should have. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=79.2s)]
*  We have to investigate that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=82.44s)]
*  We have to find out exactly what happened. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=83.44s)]
*  You know, 50 years ago, Aaron, there was a similar colossal intelligence failure when [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=85.44s)]
*  we were attacked in 1973 on the Yom Kippur War from the south by Egypt, from the north [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=92.64s)]
*  by Syria. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=97.92s)]
*  And we were then taken by surprise. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=99.08s)]
*  And we had after that, we had a commission of inquiry and lessons were learned. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  And it was an important process for Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=106.76s)]
*  And we will probably do the same thing now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=109.36s)]
*  I'm sure when this war is over, we have to look very carefully at what happened, where [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=110.88s)]
*  was the information, why wasn't it understood, who is responsible. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  So in July, a veteran, I'm sorry, Israeli intelligence analyst said that Hamas had conducted [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=120.64s)]
*  an intense day-long training exercise. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=126.52s)]
*  An analyst said this appears similar to what was outlined in the blueprint. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=129.16s)]
*  Now, the analyst, we understand, works for Unit 8200, which is Israel's signals intelligence [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=132.67999999999998s)]
*  agency, went ahead and warned higher-ups. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=137.32s)]
*  And according to encrypted emails reviewed by the New York Times, two things then happened. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=139.92s)]
*  One, Mark, is that a colonel in the Gaza division brushed off the concerns. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=144.16s)]
*  And two, is that veteran analyst commented, and I quote, I utterly refute that the scenario [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=148.48s)]
*  is imaginary. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  You can almost hear the frustration in the words that that analyst chose to use. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=155.72s)]
*  Mark, I'm curious as to what you think as to why there was such disbelief. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=161.6s)]
*  When Israel at that point had the battle plans and then visual proof of the plans being practiced, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=166.16s)]
*  why was there still such disbelief? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  So all these questions need to be looked at seriously and professionally and objectively. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=175.44s)]
*  And we'll do that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=180.72s)]
*  It's our obligation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, ultimately, Israel will continue to live in a challenging neighborhood. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  Some would even say a dangerous neighborhood. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=190.16s)]
*  And therefore, it's our obligation that our intelligence services have to be good. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=192.16s)]
*  And if there are failures, we have to understand where the failures happened and why they happened. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=195.84s)]
*  So was the Prime Minister Netanyahu aware of the Hamas document? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=201.32s)]
*  I'm not aware that he was. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=206.56s)]
*  I don't know that he was aware. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  He said, like everyone else, that when there are investigations after this war, exactly [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=210.2s)]
*  what happened, he'll, of course, be there to answer questions and tell exactly what he was given and what he wasn't given. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=217.44s)]
*  But at this point, you and he haven't even had a conversation as to whether he was aware of these documents [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  that the New York Times reporting about. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=227.52s)]
*  Not this specific document, but we have we have had conversations on this general level. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=230.12s)]
*  But once again, these discussions we need to discuss at the right time and the right time will be after this war at the moment. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=234.88s)]
*  I think all of Israel is focused on winning this war. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=242.72s)]
*  We have to win this war against Hamas so that October 7th can never happen again. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l556W2LMzE&t=245.48s)]
