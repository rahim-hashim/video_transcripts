# Military analyst on what can and can't happen during pause in Gaza fighting
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k)
*  We're going to take you to some live images right now over northern Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=0.0s)]
*  You can see what we've been watching are a combination of flares and what appear to be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=4.48s)]
*  strikes as night begins to fall over there in Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=7.96s)]
*  And of course, as we've been monitoring, the Israeli military says it's still been targeting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=12.6s)]
*  Hamas infrastructure ahead of the truce that doesn't take effect until tomorrow morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war after the fighting pause, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=23.8s)]
*  saying it won't end until, quote, Hamas is destroyed, all the hostages are released, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=28.92s)]
*  and there is nobody in Gaza who can threaten Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=34.84s)]
*  So we're going to continue to monitor some of these images as we welcome our next guest, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=37.56s)]
*  CNN military analyst and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander General Wesley Clark. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=42.24s)]
*  So obviously, we've been watching some of these some of these images here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=48.0s)]
*  There was a question of how perhaps intense strikes would be in the lead up to the actual [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=52.44s)]
*  moment this truce took effect. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=57.56s)]
*  And so we're expecting to begin at 3 a.m. Eastern Time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=59.68s)]
*  And this may be precedes my question. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=62.0s)]
*  But what do you expect to happen? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=63.6s)]
*  We leading up to that moment? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think the strikes will be as intense as Israel has targets for. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=66.28s)]
*  There'll be no slacking off until the exact moment of the truce. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=73.04s)]
*  And I'm sure that this was an issue that was really hammered out in the cabinet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=77.84s)]
*  I'm sure there were voices saying you can't give a truce. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  You've got to go through with this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=86.12s)]
*  You've got to finish the job against Hamas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=87.54s)]
*  And so the Israeli military will be pressing to do as much as they can during the truce [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=90.42s)]
*  period, Omar. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  They're going to still have the right to self-defense. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=98.30000000000001s)]
*  And you know, it's a very strange you call it a truce. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=100.94000000000001s)]
*  It could be called a pause. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=103.38000000000001s)]
*  It could be called a temporary ceasefire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=106.14000000000001s)]
*  But whatever you call it, there's no enforcement mechanism. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=107.98s)]
*  So there are no independent observers on the ground. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  And what normally happens when something like this kind of a pause occurs is maybe the shooting [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=114.94s)]
*  stops for a while, but pretty soon it starts again because someone feels threatened and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=121.14s)]
*  they have the right to self-defense. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=126.66s)]
*  After the period of four or five days, assuming the hostages get released on schedule, unless [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=129.62s)]
*  there's a continuing release of hostages beyond the 50, as Prime Minister Netanyahu said, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=135.74s)]
*  he's going to resume. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=141.18s)]
*  And this is going to be a real struggle. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=142.54s)]
*  There'll be strong political forces, pressure on Israel not to resume. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=145.06s)]
*  So how this gets resolved is the key strategic problem for Israel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  And for those just tuning in, we're monitoring the scene over Gaza right now. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=155.7s)]
*  We've been seeing some flares, combination of what appear to be some strikes going into [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=160.34s)]
*  Gaza, as well as night begins to fall. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=164.7s)]
*  And obviously, under 20 hours to when this truce was set to effect, this is, of course, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=167.18s)]
*  before then. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=172.46s)]
*  Now, when we look, General, at some of the details in this deal, four to five day pause, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=173.46s)]
*  but what does a pause like this typically mean militarily? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=178.46s)]
*  What can and can't you do essentially in a timeframe like that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=182.4s)]
*  Well, when it starts, let's look at it from the Israeli side. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=186.54000000000002s)]
*  They'd like to replenish, relax, get a break for the troops that are in front line contact, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=192.94s)]
*  but can they really trust Amos? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=197.66s)]
*  So there'll be a period of doubt here, and they'll have to keep their guard up and they'll [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=199.78s)]
*  consolidate their positions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=205.34s)]
*  They're inside Gaza, but they don't control Gaza. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=207.1s)]
*  There are tunnel entrances they're being shot at from behind on some occasions, so they [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=210.22s)]
*  don't really have any security in there. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=215.06s)]
*  Maybe they'll rotate some troops in and out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=217.5s)]
*  On the Amos side, they're going to use it to consolidate, replenish, resupply, reorganize, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=220.0s)]
*  try to reestablish communications, and be ready for the next wave of the Israeli fighting. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=227.06s)]
*  So this is a humanitarian effort. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=233.22s)]
*  There'll be some humanitarian assistance that comes in, unless there are some really strange, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=236.14s)]
*  strong controls here. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=242.54s)]
*  Amos is going to get what it needs out of that humanitarian assistance and replenish [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  its own fuel stocks or whatever. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  So this is a, let's get the hostages out. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=251.82s)]
*  It'll be a great thing, but this is far from over, Omar, and it's very dynamic. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=255.38s)]
*  It's really hard to predict where it's going to go. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's not just on the ground that we're looking at here. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=264.06s)]
*  U.S. and Israel both pausing drone flights over Gaza as part of this hostage deal as [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=265.7s)]
*  well per a senior White House official. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=269.74s)]
*  And to one of your points that you made, Israel's government has made clear they plan to resume [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=271.98s)]
*  its air and ground campaign to, quote, complete the eradication of Hamas after this truce, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=275.94s)]
*  temporary pause, whatever you want to call it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=283.62s)]
*  But also they've left the door open to continue these pauses by an additional day for every [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=285.58s)]
*  10 hostages who are released. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=288.9s)]
*  So how do you expect Israel to try and balance their goal of hostage release, but also with [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=290.68s)]
*  their goal of destroying Hamas? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=295.5s)]
*  You know, that's a tough call. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=299.22s)]
*  And it's a really tough political call on Netanyahu and his war cabinet, because the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=300.9s)]
*  military knows that Hamas is... [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=308.06s)]
*  Hamas to win, a victory for Hamas is they've used the hostages and they've survived this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=310.78s)]
*  And then they emerge as heroes among their followers and supporters, the Iranians, the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah, and these other Palestinian jihadi groups. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=322.14s)]
*  They will use the hostages. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=325.97999999999996s)]
*  Eventually they hope Israel will lose its appetite for continuing the fight. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=328.09999999999997s)]
*  And then Hamas will say, oh, we made it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=334.34s)]
*  It was a successful operation. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=336.9s)]
*  Israel knows this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=339.21999999999997s)]
*  Israel knows that if they don't eliminate Hamas, that it will set the stage for future [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=340.7s)]
*  operations like this, perhaps by Hezbollah coming out of Lebanon. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=345.29999999999995s)]
*  So this is a really, really tough call. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=350.29999999999995s)]
*  In the past, Israel has turned loose 1,000 prisoners to get one Israeli soldier back. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=353.9s)]
*  So the weight on Israel is human life, Israeli human life, is the most important overriding factor. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=362.5s)]
*  But this is the first time that Israel has declared an existential threat, according [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=368.5s)]
*  to Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=375.1s)]
*  This is Hamas, is an existential threat. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=376.58s)]
*  Maybe that changes the calculus. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=379.86s)]
*  There are all kinds of dynamics that make it very unpredictable tomorrow. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=382.58s)]
*  Yeah, and of course, and I should mention again, as you've been talking, we've been [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=386.3s)]
*  seeing these flares and what appear to be strikes happen as night begins to fall there. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=390.18s)]
*  So a lot of dynamics to keep an eye on even ahead of this long negotiated truce or pause [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=394.90000000000003s)]
*  or whatever you want to call it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=400.94s)]
*  General Wesley Clark, thank you so much. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=402.3s)]
*  And leaders from around the world. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ_Ex8gxt-k&t=404.62s)]
