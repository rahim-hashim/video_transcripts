# Nearly half of Israeli munitions dropped on Gaza are ‘dumb bombs,’ US intelligence finds
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ)
*  President Biden's national security advisor is in Tel Aviv right now for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  discussions meeting with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, its [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=3.92s)]
*  defense minister as well. Other members of the war cabinet. The White House [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=7.92s)]
*  said a major directive for Jake Sullivan is to pressure Israeli leaders to be [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=11.6s)]
*  more surgical and precise in their pursuit of Hamas in order to reduce [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=15.76s)]
*  harm to civilians. But CNN is learning that thousands of the air to ground [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=19.64s)]
*  military weapons used in Gaza since the Hamas terror attack have been unguided. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=23.16s)]
*  CNN national security reporter Natasha Bertrand is here with the details. This [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=27.72s)]
*  is illuminating reporting, especially in the wake of President Biden saying [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=32.8s)]
*  that Israel is engaged in indiscriminate bombing. What more are [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=37.0s)]
*  your U. S intelligence sources telling you about this? Natasha? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=40.94s)]
*  Yeah, Pam. So what we learned is that the U. S intelligence community assesses [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=44.92s)]
*  that of the roughly 29,000 air to ground munitions that Israel has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=48.36s)]
*  dropped on Gaza over the last two plus months, about 40 to 45% of those [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=52.52s)]
*  munitions have been unguided, also known as dumb bombs. Now that stands in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=57.92s)]
*  contrast, of course, to precision guided munitions, which are sometimes laser [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  guided GPS guided typically are more accurate and precise than unguided [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=65.92s)]
*  munitions, which experts told us really pose an elevated risk to civilians and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=70.4s)]
*  can be less precise. And when you're talking about such a densely populated [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=76.08s)]
*  area like Gaza is, you know, the difference between a target reaching a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=80.4s)]
*  munition reaching its target within a few feet can mean a matter of life and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=85.6s)]
*  death in such a densely populated area. And so the question is now, why is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=89.62s)]
*  Israel using these dumb bombs? And we really don't have a great explanation at [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=94.98s)]
*  this point. Um, you US the U. S has provided Israel with the kinds of bomb [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=99.36s)]
*  kits that they can use to transform their munitions that they have in their [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=104.12s)]
*  stockpile into smart munitions, smart bombs that are, you know, GPS or laser [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=108.28s)]
*  guided or other forms of of of precision guided munitions. But the Israelis are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=112.74s)]
*  still choosing to use in a very large proportion of the time these unguided [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=118.16s)]
*  munitions. And that really, according to the experts that we spoke to undercuts [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=123.56s)]
*  the repeated Israeli argument that they're doing everything that they [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=127.32s)]
*  possibly can to minimize civilian casualties. Now we did get a statement [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=130.8s)]
*  after we published this story from an idea of spokesperson who said that the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=135.28s)]
*  type of munitions used in each strike is determined according to the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=139.56s)]
*  characteristics of the target. And they said that they do take steps to mitigate [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=143.44s)]
*  the harm to civilians. But really, the sheer scale of the use of these dumb [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=148.12s)]
*  bombs has raised a lot of questions among experts about why Israel's using [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=154.76000000000002s)]
*  whether it's necessary. And of course, if it's true, then why, you know, they're [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=160.22s)]
*  saying that they're taking all of these steps to mitigate harm to civilians [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=165.3s)]
*  when these actually can pose a greater threat to them in the long run. Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=169.5s)]
*  And we should note, it's not just Israeli officials saying they're doing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=173.54000000000002s)]
*  everything they can to limit civilian casualties. The U. S. To John Kirby, a [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=175.78s)]
*  spokesperson for the National Security Council just said Wednesday that Israel [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=180.38s)]
*  is doing everything they can to reduce civilian casualties. And yet this [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=183.5s)]
*  reporting is coming out really raising a lot of questions about that. Natasha [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=186.9s)]
*  Bertrand, thank you so much. In a short time ago, the White House revealed more [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=190.32s)]
*  of what happened during Jake Sullivan's trip to Tel Aviv today. Yeah, National [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=194.38s)]
*  Security Council official John Kirby said that Sullivan talked to Israeli [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=198.26s)]
*  leaders about transitioning from quote high intensity operations to lower [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=201.38s)]
*  intensity operations in the near future. Let's take you now to Israel with CNN [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=205.78s)]
*  correspondent Jeremy Diamond, whose life force insta wrote Jeremy, what are you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=209.98000000000002s)]
*  learning about the meetings between the National Security adviser and Israeli [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=213.86s)]
*  officials? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=218.22000000000003s)]
*  Well, these meetings really come at a critical point in Israel's war effort [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=221.74s)]
*  against Hamas in Gaza. It comes as not only the civilian death toll is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=224.94000000000003s)]
*  mounting, but also as growing international pressure is also mounting [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=228.62s)]
*  on Israel and being acknowledged by the United States, including by President [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=233.66000000000003s)]
*  Biden just days ago, talking about Israel's indiscriminate bombing of Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=237.86s)]
*  So enter the picture. Jake Sullivan meeting with top Israeli officials, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=242.1s)]
*  including the Israeli prime minister, to discuss not only that mounting civilian [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=245.94s)]
*  death toll, the ways in which the United States wants Israel to be more targeted [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=249.89999999999998s)]
*  in its operations, but also beginning to think about a timetable for [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=253.72s)]
*  transitioning the high intensity fighting and bombing of Gaza that we [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  are seeing from Israeli forces right now to a lower intensity phase. That's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=261.5s)]
*  according to John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman. There is an [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=265.38s)]
*  acknowledgement from the Israelis that that is part of the discussion here. But [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=269.36s)]
*  for now, the Israelis seem committed to maintaining this current tempo of the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=273.32s)]
*  war effort for weeks, if not months to come. You have Galan's, the defense [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  minister were told told Jake Sullivan that this war could last more than [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=281.72s)]
*  several months. And the Israeli prime minister for his part, he said that the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=285.74s)]
*  fighting will continue until the complete destruction of Hamas until [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=289.76s)]
*  victory. And so there is a question here about whether the message from American [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  officials is being received by the Israelis. We know that another key [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=297.84s)]
*  question that's being discussed is also the fate of Gaza after Hamas is [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=301.14s)]
*  destroyed. If indeed that goal is achieved, but also at the moment right [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  now, the fate of those hostages, including at least eight Americans who [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=309.96s)]
*  are believed to be held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. John Kirby also addressed [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  that point moments ago. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=318.32s)]
*  We're still working by the hour to try to get a pause back in place so that [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=321.96s)]
*  hostages can get released. I'll let the Israelis speak to their negotiators and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=325.92s)]
*  where where they are and what they're going to focus on. I can tell you one [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=330.28s)]
*  of the things Jake's doing in the region. I mean, if you need proof that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=333.71999999999997s)]
*  we still want to see a pause, just look at where the national security adviser [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=337.0s)]
*  is today. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=340.32s)]
*  And we know that there is an active effort by U. S. Officials to try and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=344.62s)]
*  restart those negotiations between Israel and Hamas mediated by the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=347.92s)]
*  Qatari government. For now, those talks have really broken down since that [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=351.84s)]
*  week long truce between Israel and Hamas ended. And now there is an effort by [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=355.52s)]
*  the United States to discuss ideas with Israel to bring those to the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=359.88s)]
*  Qataris to have them bring those ideas to Hamas. But for now, it appears that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=363.2s)]
*  there are those negotiations are really going nowhere. The Israeli prime [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  minister, though, after his meeting with Jake Sullivan, he did say that a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=370.96s)]
*  main goal of this war effort is to secure the return and the release of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=374.88s)]
*  those hostages. So we will see if there's any traction after Jake Sullivan's [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=380.44s)]
*  visit to the region. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, definitely a thread to keep an eye on there. Jeremy Diamond. Thank you [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  so much. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7xeZNcABHQ&t=389.23999999999995s)]
