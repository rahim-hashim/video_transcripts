# See what it looks like at Egypt-Gaza crossing where anger is growing
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk)
*  Stacks of humanitarian aid that were supposed to have already gone into Gaza today will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=0.0s)]
*  now cross the Egyptian border within the next 24 to 48 hours, supposedly, in about 200 trucks, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=8.34s)]
*  which carrying dire humanitarian aid, water and food and medicine, are just sitting there, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=17.76s)]
*  just a short distance away from the tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, innocent [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=26.34s)]
*  civilians, who desperately need it. The United Nations calling this a difference between [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=31.46s)]
*  life and death. CNN's Clarissa Ward is in Cairo, Egypt for us, and Clarissa officials [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=35.74s)]
*  say road repairs were needed before the crucial aid could pass through. Is that really the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=40.34s)]
*  only reason for this 13-day-long delay so far? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=45.5s)]
*  No, Jake, it's not. We were actually at the Rafa border crossing today. The UN says there's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=49.94s)]
*  a number of other issues. Firstly, the issue of the Israelis wanting to verify everything [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=57.94s)]
*  that's in those trucks to make sure there's no weapons there. They need to come up with [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=63.06s)]
*  some kind of a mechanism to do that, but that takes time. How would they do that? Where [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=66.66s)]
*  would they do that? The second issue, they say, is that they don't want this to be a [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=71.7s)]
*  one-off of just 20 trucks going in. They want to have an agreement in place for a sustained, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=75.94s)]
*  continuous humanitarian corridor. They're worried potentially that their trucks and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=81.94s)]
*  their workers could get attacked or mobbed if it's just that one sort of shipment or [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=85.7s)]
*  movement of 20 trucks. All of this, though, Jake, is really coming down to the wire now, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=91.7s)]
*  with fuel stocks about to run out in a matter of days and anger getting ever, ever higher. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=97.94s)]
*  Take a look. For days, they have been waiting. More than 200 trucks full of aid desperately [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=103.94s)]
*  needed in Gaza, but stuck on the Egyptian side of the Rafa border crossing. UN Secretary General [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=111.22s)]
*  Antonio Guterres hoped to be here for a much-needed diplomatic win. Instead, he found himself in the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=118.66s)]
*  midst of a protest, his remarks drowned out by the crowd. People are chanting over and over again, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=128.34s)]
*  with our blood, with our souls, we will defend Palestine. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=134.82s)]
*  There's a huge amount of anger, a huge amount of emotion, much of it directed at the West. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=141.54s)]
*  We need justice! We need justice! And much also at Western media, who people here feel have favored [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=148.58s)]
*  Israeli voices over Palestinians. Where is your humanity? A protester starts shouting at me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  We invite her to do an interview with us. Okay, when a thousand plus Palestinian babies die, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=163.14s)]
*  you don't feel the same. You don't feel the same as when I tell you one of your own has died. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=168.98s)]
*  But these are our own, and it is unfair, and Egypt will sell with Palestine. All Western channels [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=174.42s)]
*  are talking for Israel. If the United Nations is standing for Israel, if all these international [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  institutions are standing for Israel, who's there for the Palestinians? And don't call it a war. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=186.33999999999997s)]
*  The jargon is even more infuriating. It's not a war. They're not on equal footing. It is not a war. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  For many, it is deeply personal. A Palestinian man holds up his ID. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=197.14s)]
*  I can't contact with my family there. You can't? Your family's on the other side? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=202.74s)]
*  Yeah, I have seven sisters and my father, my mother, grandmother, uncles. All my family is there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=206.02s)]
*  I can't contact with them. I don't know if they are okay or not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=213.46s)]
*  As Egyptian soldiers stand by, the demonstrators get more animated. Protests are normally illegal [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=220.74s)]
*  here, but today the Egyptian president called on people to take to the streets. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=227.78s)]
*  So this is rapidly becoming a very chaotic scene now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=234.58s)]
*  They're trying to get the secretary general out of here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=240.58s)]
*  We are ordered back onto the buses and escorted out through the crowd back to the airport, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=245.38s)]
*  where piles of aid sit by the runway, so close to where they need to be, but held back, the UN says, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=251.61999999999998s)]
*  by complications over how to monitor the trucks that enter Gaza and how to establish a continuous [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=258.5s)]
*  humanitarian corridor. When you saw the anger of those protesters, most of it leveled at Israel and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=265.14s)]
*  the U.S., but also at the international community for failing to stop the situation. What's your [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=272.58s)]
*  response? I think what's important to say is that we are doing everything we can, engaging with all [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=278.9s)]
*  the parties to make sure that sooner rather than later we are able to have not only a first convoy, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=284.82s)]
*  but continued aid to the population in Gaza. I think it should be as quickly as possible [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=292.02s)]
*  and with as many as possible trucks to cross in the first few days. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=301.85999999999996s)]
*  But that is little comfort to the people of Gaza, for whom every day, every hour is vital. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=308.58s)]
*  Jake, one of the other sticking points here appears to be the issue of fuel. There has been agreement [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=319.14s)]
*  about food, about medicine, about water, but fuel is desperately needed to power the generators that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=325.14s)]
*  are keeping those hospitals going, that are keeping those refuge centers overwhelmed as they are still [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  going. President Biden, as you mentioned in the introduction, said hopefully within 24 to 48 hours [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=336.58s)]
*  we may start to see movement, but there are still obstacles to overcome, and the Secretary General [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  saying we desperately need to end this impasse. Jake. All right, Clarissa Ward in Cairo, Egypt for us. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=348.82s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAPu4FLd2pk&t=355.53999999999996s)]
