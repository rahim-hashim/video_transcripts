# Netanyahu adviser: Civilian casualty numbers from Gaza should be taken 'with grain of salt'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg)
*  And we're back with senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mark Regev. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=0.0s)]
*  He's also the former Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=5.96s)]
*  Thanks for joining us, Ambassador Regev. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  The New York Times is reporting that three senior Israeli officials say that the plan [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=11.88s)]
*  is to wipe out Hamas's top leadership in Gaza and to invade Gaza City. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=17.98s)]
*  We haven't really heard what the plan is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=24.38s)]
*  We've seen a lot of airstrikes on Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=26.88s)]
*  Can you confirm that that is the plan to wipe out Hamas's top leadership and to invade Gaza [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=29.16s)]
*  City with a ground force? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=34.76s)]
*  Jake, you of course know that I'm not going to go into operational details of military [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=36.8s)]
*  activities that are still ahead of us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=42.96s)]
*  I can only share the goal with you of the operation, which has been stated and I'll [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=45.28s)]
*  state it again. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=49.84s)]
*  We will dismantle Hamas's military machine and take apart its political governance in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=51.36s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=57.64s)]
*  We will destroy both the military wing of Hamas, its military machine, its terrorist [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=58.84s)]
*  capabilities and its governmental activities, its governmental structure in Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=64.72s)]
*  How many people is that, do you think? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  I can't go into numbers, but it means that when this is over, Hamas will be incapable [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  of launching the sort of horrendous attack that they did on October 7th. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=80.04s)]
*  They will be physically incapable of launching such an operation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=85.06s)]
*  So certainly taking out Hamas's leadership, I understand the point of that, but the Palestinian [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  Health Ministry in Gaza says 2,800 Palestinians have been killed and somewhere between a quarter [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  and a third of them are children. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=102.86s)]
*  That's not Hamas's leadership. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=106.18s)]
*  Can I please offer a word of caution? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  Now I know that there is real suffering in Gaza. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=113.62s)]
*  There's a war going on and innocent people are getting caught up in a very difficult [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=116.26s)]
*  situation. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=120.34s)]
*  I don't minimize that, but you have to take with a grain of salt any information that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=121.34s)]
*  comes out of the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=126.78s)]
*  That has to be said. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=132.1s)]
*  The Hamas is not a democracy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=133.1s)]
*  There's not an independent health bureaucracy that is trying to do its best. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=134.82s)]
*  Every doctor you speak to, every hospital director you speak to works under the gun [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=139.6s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=144.44s)]
*  They are not independent. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=145.44s)]
*  If they speak out of turn, they will pay a price. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=147.28s)]
*  It's like speaking to a doctor in North Korea or a doctor in the former Soviet Union. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=150.56s)]
*  They don't have independent opinions. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=155.64s)]
*  They have to follow the party line and if not, they face violent consequences. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  So those numbers, they might be true, they might not be true. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=162.57999999999998s)]
*  Hamas of course has an interest in exaggerating civilian casualties. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=165.76s)]
*  So let's assume that you... [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=170.48s)]
*  Of course Hamas doesn't say how many of them were combatants of course, correct? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=171.48s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  So let's assume that you take out the Hamas leadership and their ability to commit atrocities. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  Ambassador Herzog told me yesterday that Israel does not want to reoccupy Gaza after the mission [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=184.32s)]
*  is done. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  So what happens after Hamas is destroyed? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  Who would be in charge of Gaza? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=193.28s)]
*  So first of all, maybe almost anything would be better than Hamas. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=197.44s)]
*  I mean if there were illusions that Hamas had somehow moderated its position, that the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  responsibility of government of being ruling over 2.3 million people forces Hamas to be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=208.32s)]
*  a more rational behavior, that was proven wrong. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=215.12s)]
*  The violence, the brutal, horrific violence that we saw on October 7th showed that to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=220.72s)]
*  be wrong. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=225.92s)]
*  This is a hardcore, unreformed, extremist, murderous terrorist organization. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=226.92s)]
*  And so you have to say if it's like ISIS, how could it get much worse? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=235.48s)]
*  So we have to hit it hard, we have to destroy its ability to attack us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=240.32s)]
*  And I've been in discussions where different contingencies have been discussed, what happens [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=247.78s)]
*  after. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=252.98s)]
*  At this stage, I'm not at liberty to discuss those discussions, but I can assure you that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=254.22s)]
*  Israel is thinking three steps ahead. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=259.32s)]
*  The most important thing now is that we focus on the total destruction of the Hamas military [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=262.7s)]
*  machine and the dismantling of its political structures. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=267.02s)]
*  There's a new report in Haaretz that alleges senior officials in Prime Minister Netanyahu's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=271.62s)]
*  office are barred from working with an Israeli Defense Ministry Task Force, which is focused [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=275.74s)]
*  on repairing infrastructure near Gaza, because the Defense Task Force is led by a staunch [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=282.02s)]
*  opponent of the Netanyahu judicial overhaul. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=290.5s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=295.14s)]
*  I have not read that report and I'm not familiar with any of that, I apologize. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=297.62s)]
*  You said that Israel is united right now, very united. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=302.0s)]
*  So far Netanyahu has not been able to get opposition leader Yair Lapid to join the unity [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=305.5s)]
*  government. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=310.38s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=312.58s)]
*  Shouldn't Israel be as united as possible? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=313.82s)]
*  We've already united by bringing in one major opposition party and as you know, they joined [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=317.62s)]
*  a few days ago and we've now got a national emergency government where Mr. Gantz, who [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=323.14s)]
*  was a very severe critic of Prime Minister Netanyahu, stepped in and said in this time [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=328.46s)]
*  of crisis, we have to unite to fight the common enemy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  And I think if you look at the polling in Israel, there's wide support for that sort [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=340.82s)]
*  of move. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=345.5s)]
*  It must be remembered, Jake, when they crossed the border on October 7th to murder us, they [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=346.5s)]
*  went to left-wing kibbutzim where people in their lives never voted for Netanyahu and [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=352.14s)]
*  they went to right-wing villages where everyone likes Netanyahu. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=358.5s)]
*  They didn't care if Israelis are left-wing or right-wing, religious, secular, what their [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=361.86s)]
*  political views are. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=366.82s)]
*  They kill us because we're Israelis. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=367.82s)]
*  They kill us because we are Jews. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=369.26s)]
*  The murderous violence we saw on October 7th, that was the largest single act of anti-Semitic [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=372.9s)]
*  violence since 1945, since the terrible years of the Holocaust. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=379.62s)]
*  We've never seen anything of that scale. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=384.5s)]
*  For what is it? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=386.74s)]
*  It's more than half a century. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=387.74s)]
*  And so I think for many Israelis, I mean, we will argue about politics just as you and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=390.06s)]
*  America argue about politics and we will do it very loudly and we'll do it very passionately. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=393.74s)]
*  But ultimately, I think these attacks by Hamas, to a certain extent, were a slap on the face. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=398.58s)]
*  We have to understand that we Israelis have a common destiny. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=403.46s)]
*  We have a common situation that we are all together in facing these terrible and horrific [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=408.26s)]
*  challenges. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=416.65999999999997s)]
*  Mark Ragev, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=417.65999999999997s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=419.65999999999997s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYcX3zRbvg&t=420.65999999999997s)]
