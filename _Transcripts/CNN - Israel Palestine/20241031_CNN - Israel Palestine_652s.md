# Normalization with Israel is 'off the table' until Palestinian statehood is resolved says Saudi FM
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM)
*  I asked the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Faham, what he makes of suggestions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=0.0s)]
*  that his countries and others in the Gulf could have done more to prevent the current [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=5.96s)]
*  situation, for example in Gaza. I also pressed him on whether his country would even consider [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=10.56s)]
*  normalising relations with Israel, absent of a concrete plan for Palestinian statehood. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=16.62s)]
*  Have a listen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=24.42s)]
*  I will say on the Kingdom's part we have been anything but ambiguous. We have been quite [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=26.16s)]
*  categorical. We called in the instance of Gaza for instance for a ceasefire from the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=29.6s)]
*  very beginning. We were very clear that even with the horrors of October 7th that an overreaction [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=34.24s)]
*  by Israel was extremely dangerous and we have seen the reality that Israel's reaction and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=42.68s)]
*  its continuing military assault in Gaza has led to a humanitarian catastrophe that has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=48.08s)]
*  not only impacted the citizens of Gaza, that has not only resulted in tens of thousands [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=54.6s)]
*  of civilian, of unjustifiable civilian deaths, it's also really put a huge question mark [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  on the international systems of rules and governance, on the legitimacy of international [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=67.28s)]
*  humanitarian law, international law and its applicability in ways that have been really [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=71.84s)]
*  un-uniform. And we've said that from the beginning. So we have been very unambiguous about it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=78.64s)]
*  And we will continue to engage. We engaged from the beginning as well on trying to find [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=83.64s)]
*  pathways out of the conflict. We have the group, the Arab League OIC contact group, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=92.88s)]
*  but we also had a group of Arab states that had engaged with the United States and others [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  to try and find ways to reach a potential ceasefire supporting of course the efforts [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=106.02s)]
*  of the US, Qatar and Egypt and others. So ambiguity is not what we in the Kingdom practice. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  We practice a very clear foreign policy based on clear guiding principles, but also of course [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=117.44s)]
*  from a prospect of not being drawn into confrontation in any way. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  You have described Israel's assault on Gaza as genocide and you've talked about Israel [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=130.02s)]
*  having to face consequences. What do you mean very specifically by that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=136.4s)]
*  I mean if we look just what's happening now in northern Gaza where we have a complete [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=142.36s)]
*  blockade of any access for humanitarian goods coupled with a continuing military assault [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=148.86s)]
*  without any real pathways for civilians to find shelter or to find safe zones that can [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=156.56s)]
*  only be described as a form of genocide. It is certainly against humanitarian law, international [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  humanitarian law. And that is feeding a continuing cycle of violence because this level of destruction, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=172.4s)]
*  this level of really devaluing of human lives, of the lives of ordinary Palestinians will [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=180.4s)]
*  feed a cycle that is against everybody's interest. And that's why we are trying to focus even [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=191.14000000000001s)]
*  in this very difficult time on a better future. And that's why we have focused on the issue [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  of a two state solution, of building a Palestinian state. I will say that while we talk about [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=204.62s)]
*  a two state solution, the reality is the state of Israel exists. So now it's about establishing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=210.62s)]
*  the state of Palestine and ensuring that the Palestinians can reach a place where they [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=215.62s)]
*  receive their right to self-determination. In the speech on Monday, the Israeli Prime [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=220.62s)]
*  Minister made no mention of a need to end the war in Gaza. No talk of any question of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=225.62s)]
*  quote, day after plans. No mention of the Palestinians. Now you have been, and just [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=233.62s)]
*  this week with the meeting here in Riyadh, hoping to get some concrete steps that would [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=241.82s)]
*  as we say, create this pathway to a Palestinian state or an independent Palestinian state. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=249.66s)]
*  How concerned are you when you hear no mention of the Palestinians, nor do you hear any mention [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=256.38s)]
*  of the day after by the current Israeli Prime Minister? What does that suggest to you? And [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=264.62s)]
*  when we talk about a pathway, what does that specifically mean? I'm of course incredibly [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=274.22s)]
*  concerned because that tells me that there is a real lack of understanding of the strategic [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=281.86s)]
*  reality. There, we are here in this region. We are stuck in this region. All of us, the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=288.58s)]
*  Palestinians, everybody, and we're going to have to find a way to live with each other. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=295.58s)]
*  And we can only live with each other if we address the rights of the Palestinians, if [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  we address the issues of injustice that the Palestinians face right now. And that is going [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=304.9s)]
*  to have to be a serious discussion. If that's not going to happen, we are setting ourselves [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=309.78s)]
*  for a continuing cycle of violence that serves no one except the extremists. Will a verbal [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=314.74s)]
*  commitment from Benjamin Netanyahu suffice? Will you, to get on a sort of, you know, on [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=320.98s)]
*  a pathway that you felt was worth sort of tabling for an independent state? And if not, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=326.58s)]
*  what specific measures does Saudi need to see to move forward? And what is Saudi Arabia's [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=332.74s)]
*  message to Benjamin Netanyahu? Is normalisation with Israel at genuine risk should you not [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=340.38s)]
*  see this commitment from Israel? I would say certainly normalisation with the Kingdom of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=347.90000000000003s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is not just a risk. It is off the table until we have a resolution to Palestinian [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=354.02s)]
*  statehood. But I would say more than that. I would say that it is not just the issue [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=360.3s)]
*  of normalisation with the Kingdom that is at risk. I would say that the security of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=364.04s)]
*  the region as a whole is at risk if we do not address the rights of the Palestinians, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=368.94s)]
*  if we do not find our way to a pathway that leads us to a Palestinian state. Because that's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=375.06s)]
*  the only way we can ensure that we can focus on the future, that we can focus on cooperation, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=380.46s)]
*  that we can focus on integration. So I would hope that the leadership of Israel sees that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=386.3s)]
*  it is not just the right thing to do, it is not just the moral thing to do, it is not [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=392.34s)]
*  just the just thing to do to give the Palestinians their rights and their state. It is also in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=396.78s)]
*  the security and strategic interest of Israel to do so. And that's, I think, up to them [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=401.7s)]
*  to decide. I want to return to that renewed US push by American officials for a ceasefire [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=407.82s)]
*  in Lebanon now. We were discussing this a little bit earlier with Jeremy Diamond. Lebanon's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=417.21999999999997s)]
*  Prime Minister, even suggesting that he is optimistic at this point. I asked the Foreign [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=421.58s)]
*  Minister whether he shared that optimism for an end to the conflict in Lebanon and whether [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=427.46s)]
*  or not Saudi Arabia is ready to re-engage with Lebanon, especially with Hezbollah's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=433.74s)]
*  military wing significantly degraded. We also talked about the Saudi-Iran relationship nearly [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=439.09999999999997s)]
*  two years after that fragile truce was struck between the two erstwhile enemies. Have a [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=446.3s)]
*  listen. I hope it is the case that we can see a ceasefire in the immediate hours, in [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=455.3s)]
*  the immediate short term. I am not sure that that is the case. I don't have the details. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=461.54s)]
*  We are not part of the direct negotiations that are going on. We certainly support the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=470.14000000000004s)]
*  effort that the US is undertaking to find a pathway to a ceasefire. I hope it comes [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=474.38s)]
*  to fruition. It's the same for Gaza. We have had, unfortunately, many false starts, many [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=480.65999999999997s)]
*  pronouncements of a near deal for a ceasefire in Gaza, only to be disappointed. My understanding [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=486.58s)]
*  is that we have in most of those instances where the talks eventually collapsed, it has [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=494.62s)]
*  been because there have been new requirements or new demands added on the part of Israel. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=500.66s)]
*  Are you prepared as the Kingdom to be better engaged going forward and significantly engaged [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=506.26000000000005s)]
*  in order to help Lebanon on the road to recovery with Hezbollah still involved in politics, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=516.02s)]
*  if not as the strategic militant group that it has been in the past? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=523.14s)]
*  From our perspective, it's up to the Lebanese, as I said. I'm not going to right now discuss [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=531.26s)]
*  what exactly the shape of Lebanon should be because it's up to the Lebanese to decide. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=538.26s)]
*  Whatever we see from that is going to inform our judgments as to how much we can engage, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=543.14s)]
*  how much we can work with Lebanon, how much we can facilitate progress in areas. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you see any signs that Iran is putting pressure on its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=561.3s)]
*  to accept a truce? You have decent contacts now with the Iranians. I'm just wondering [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=567.18s)]
*  what your understanding is. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=575.42s)]
*  I certainly hope that Iran, like us, is working towards regional de-escalation on all fronts, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  not just in Lebanon. That's very much the focus of our conversations, my conversations [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=588.0s)]
*  with my Iranian counterpart. What I hear from the Iranians is that they are indeed very [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  much keyed into the fact that continuing on the cycle of escalation is not in their interest. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  I do hope that they are translating that into actually practical steps. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=605.08s)]
*  Let's talk about Iran. Are you confident that Israel's recent retaliatory strike on these [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=611.24s)]
*  selected military sites in Iran signals the end of what has been this face-off that otherwise [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=615.68s)]
*  threatens to plunge this region into further chaos? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=624.0s)]
*  Am I confident? I cannot be confident of anything that is in the control of other parties, other [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=629.12s)]
*  actors, but what I can say is that I have made it clear to our Iranian counterparts [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=634.72s)]
*  that it is important that we avoid any further escalation. My sense is that at least on their [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  side that they realize the risks of escalation and would prefer to avoid it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHmRs3iAGgM&t=647.24s)]
