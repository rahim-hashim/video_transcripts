# New IDF video shows moment an Israeli tank fires on Sinwar's building
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y)
*  What is next for Hamas and Israel after the killing of Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar in Gaza? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF video shows the building where Sinwar was targeted. Israel says its forces killed [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=8.0s)]
*  him during an operation targeting a house in Gaza. Hamas now confirms that their chief [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=13.24s)]
*  is dead. But a top negotiator for the group says hostages won't be returned until the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=20.0s)]
*  war ends, Israel withdraws and the Palestinian prisoners are released. Israel also warns [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=26.68s)]
*  that the war is not over. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=33.6s)]
*  Today, evil has suffered a heavy blow. But the task before us is not yet complete. Hamas [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=35.68s)]
*  will no longer rule Gaza. This is the beginning of the day after Hamas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  A lot to get to. Matthew Chance will be joining us again this hour from Tel Aviv. That is [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=50.68s)]
*  in just a moment. Salma Abdulaziz following developments for us today from London. I think [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=57.8s)]
*  we should start inside Gaza this hour. What's been the reaction there to the official confirmation [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=65.16s)]
*  by Hamas that Yahya Sinwar, the political and military head of that group, has been [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=72.36s)]
*  killed? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=79.4s)]
*  Let me begin with a little bit of context, Becky. It's important to remember that Hamas [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=81.16s)]
*  is not an elected government. There have been no elections in Gaza since 2006. That means [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=85.4s)]
*  Palestinians simply do not get a say in who rules them, including of course, Yahya Sinwar, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  a very controversial figure, one who really struck fear in the hearts of many Gazans because [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=98.48s)]
*  of his reputation of taking out any potential enemies. Of course, he has supporters, but [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=103.88s)]
*  at a time like this, even critics of Yahya Sinwar are focused on the one major enemy [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  as Gazans see it, and that is Israel. You are now more than a year into this conflict. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=117.16s)]
*  At least 42,000 people killed, nearly every single person displaced by this near constant [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=123.0s)]
*  bombardment and a ground incursion that continues, famine spreading, illness spreading, disease [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=129.44s)]
*  spreading throughout the Gaza Strip. So absolutely for Gazans, their focus is the conflict with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=136.2s)]
*  the Israeli military. And for them, the priority is not what are the political happenings within [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  Hamas or who Israel kills, but quite simply just surviving, Becky, day by day. That is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=150.28s)]
*  absolutely the priority. That is absolutely the focus in their minds. And it is unlikely [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  that this will change matters on the ground. Yahya Sinwar could easily be replaced and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=160.72s)]
*  he could be replaced by an even more hardline figure. So for everyday Gazans, Becky, this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=165.0s)]
*  only continues that cycle of violence that claims more lives. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=171.8s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. I want to move on to Gideon Levy now who joins us. He's a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=177.72s)]
*  columnist with Haaretz newspaper and served as advisor to the former Israeli Prime Minister [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=182.0s)]
*  Shimon Peres. It's good to have you, sir. I've just been discussing with Salma what [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=189.44s)]
*  happens, you know, what's been the response in Gaza to the news what some 24 hours ago [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=196.48s)]
*  that Sinwar indeed had been killed by the IDF and indeed what happens next. What's your [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  assessment, sir? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=208.04s)]
*  First of all, I'm under the impression, if I can be emotional for a moment, I just spoke [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=211.04s)]
*  now with a friend in Gaza that I didn't speak to all year and I was sure he was dead and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=215.88s)]
*  he's alive. And he told me that there was quite a sense of happiness last night. He's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  in one of those rescue places in the Moasi, in those tents, facilities. And he says there [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=226.8s)]
*  was quite a sense of happiness last night hearing that Sinwar was assassinated, which [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=236.2s)]
*  doesn't mean that all the Palestinians share the same, but there are people in Gaza who [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=241.36s)]
*  were happy last night. In Israel it's different. If you ask me about Israel, I'll tell you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and that sentiment we have heard reflected from those that are Gaza freelancers and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=252.08s)]
*  staff have been able to collect. On the one hand, a lot of relief, perhaps, is the term [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=262.64s)]
*  that many have used, but also a sense of what happens to us next. Others are very much mourning [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  Sinwar's death. You then went on to say that is very different, of course, from the sentiment [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=279.84s)]
*  in Israel. Can you just explain, describe what that sentiment is? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=285.64s)]
*  So while the Palestinians, for them, I mean, those who suffered this year, and we, both [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=291.84s)]
*  of us, cannot imagine ourselves their suffer, in Israel it's a different picture, obviously. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=297.4s)]
*  And many Israelis saw it as a great achievement, and there was even a sense of joy last night [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  in Israel. I can understand this sentiment. It's very human. I mean, Sinwar, for most [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  of the Israelis, for all the Israelis, was the face of evil, and now he was killed. The [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  main newspaper of Israel gave this morning the headline, the death of the Satan, no less [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=321.96s)]
*  than this. Other, compared to Adolf Hitler, this is all understandable and legitimate. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=328.12s)]
*  The only question is, after this joy, what comes next? I mean, are we in a better place [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=334.88s)]
*  today? And I'm not sure so. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=340.72s)]
*  Well that better place would be a route through, a fork in the road, an opportunity, as Joe [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=345.68s)]
*  Biden has said, for the prospect or the path towards peace. We've heard from the Prime [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  Minister himself, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has said that the war is not over. He has [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=359.6s)]
*  talked about an opportunity to go going forward, but he also, and has also said that we are [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=364.68s)]
*  in the day after Hamas at this point. What do you make of what you've heard from the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=371.72s)]
*  Prime Minister at this point? How do you read his intentions about what happens next? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=378.16s)]
*  I can only guess, but my assessment is that Benjamin Netanyahu, and we have to realise [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=385.16s)]
*  it, never believed in any kind of settlements with the Palestinians, never. He always believed [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=392.16s)]
*  and still believes, and now after the last so-called military achievements or successes, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=400.36s)]
*  he believes in it even more, only in living on our sword, only in living on our military [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=406.6s)]
*  force. That's the only guarantee and that's the only solution. That's a very dangerous [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=413.12s)]
*  ideology obviously, but it is an ideology that we have to realise that leads him, because [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=419.0s)]
*  people tend to think that he does everything only for his personal survival. I'm not sure. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=426.0s)]
*  I think that he really believes there is no room for any kind of settlement with the Palestinians, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=430.96s)]
*  which means that Israel will live from war to war because they will never give up and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=437.68s)]
*  the resistance will never stop, because that's the nature of people. If they are oppressed, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=442.76s)]
*  they are resisting. This means that we are due to live like this for decades. I hope [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=447.52s)]
*  that this ideology will be proven as wrong and we will replace it with a newer ideology, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=453.76s)]
*  but right now I don't see anyone in Israel who calls for a different ideology. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=460.36s)]
*  Gideon Levy's perspective as we continue to question what happens next. Let me just bring [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  in Matthew Chance, my colleague. Israel today, Matthew, as I understand it, calling up additional [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=473.8s)]
*  reserve brigades to northern Israel, pressing on with its war on a number of fronts. Of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=479.48s)]
*  course it talks about being at war on seven fronts at the moment. We are talking very [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=486.96s)]
*  specifically about the front and with Lebanon. What do we understand to be the detail and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=490.44s)]
*  what is the intention there at this point? Is the end game any clearer? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, clearly the intention is to show that at this stage Israel is not letting up any [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  pressure on Lebanon or indeed on Iran. There have been meetings, very high level meetings [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=511.58s)]
*  over the course of the day with the Israeli Prime Minister and his top security officials, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=516.9s)]
*  including the Defence Minister of Israel, to talk about the extent to which the killing [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=521.62s)]
*  of Yaya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza on Wednesday, may have an impact on the timing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  of any further military operations in Lebanon and in Iran. They haven't released any details [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=534.74s)]
*  about any concrete measures or any steps they are going to be taking, but they have [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=541.3s)]
*  said in a joint statement that a window of opportunity has been opened with the killing [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=545.4599999999999s)]
*  of Sinwar. Again, reiterating this idea that because of the death of this key figure in [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=551.3399999999999s)]
*  the Palestinian militant group Hamas, it may be a time for renewed negotiations. Indeed, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=558.02s)]
*  my sources inside the Israeli government tell me they are trying to create pressure [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=565.74s)]
*  quickly with surviving Hamas officials on the ground who may be holding hostages to [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=570.86s)]
*  get them to set those hostages free in exchange for some kind of clemency. Netanyahu, the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=577.9s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister, has made a specific offer to members of Hamas saying that he [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=584.42s)]
*  will let them live if they wave the white flag and they surrender the hostages they [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=589.42s)]
*  may be holding at this stage. Again, the problem or part of the problem is that so far Hamas [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=595.14s)]
*  are not giving any indication that they are willing to play along. There has been a statement [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=603.6999999999999s)]
*  from a senior political figure at Hamas acknowledging the death of Yaya Sinwar at the hands of Israeli [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=608.3399999999999s)]
*  troops. They waited a couple of days before they did that. There has been a further statement, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=614.5s)]
*  also very defiant, basically saying that Israeli hostages will not be released until such time [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=619.6199999999999s)]
*  as Israel's aggression, in their words, against the people of Gaza has come to an end. So, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=625.5799999999999s)]
*  yes, it's a hopeful moment. It's potentially a window of opportunity and a pivotal moment, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=632.06s)]
*  but it's not a certainty that anything concrete will come out of this except for more fighting. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=638.38s)]
*  And so that's the grim reality, I think, of the situation now as we monitor what will happen [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=644.06s)]
*  over the coming days and weeks. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvvNDmjwV0Y&t=650.86s)]
