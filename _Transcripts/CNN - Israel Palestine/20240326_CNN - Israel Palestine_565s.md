# CNN's Clarissa Ward shares exclusive look at destruction in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U)
*  It may be hard to believe, but we are now 67 days into the war between Israel and Hamas, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=0.0s)]
*  and our next guest has been crucial in bringing our reporting to you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=5.0s)]
*  I have to tell you, her name is Clarissa Ward, and I used to work with Clarissa Ward back in the day. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=9.0s)]
*  I have always admired her reporting because she is a badass, and she is fearless, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=14.0s)]
*  especially her desire to be on the ground where the biggest and often most dangerous news is breaking. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=19.0s)]
*  There she is. And tonight is no different. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=24.0s)]
*  Thanks to Clarissa, CNN is the first Western media outlet to get access into southern Gaza [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=26.0s)]
*  and report in Gaza, rather, and report independently. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=32.0s)]
*  She has footage you won't see anywhere else, and this is the first time she's talking about it since returning. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=35.0s)]
*  Clarissa Ward is CNN's chief international correspondent. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=41.0s)]
*  Clarissa, we thank you for joining us. It's really good to see you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=44.0s)]
*  Thanks, Gayle. It's really good to be with you. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=50.0s)]
*  Every time I see you on TV, I tense up a little bit and say, please, please, please let her be safe. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=52.0s)]
*  Let all the people over there who are covering this war, but it's so crucial and so critical, the job that you're doing. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=57.0s)]
*  But I want to start with the obvious, because most of the world is watching from home. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=62.0s)]
*  We're watching from the safety of our homes, watching from the safety of our countries, wherever that may be. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=66.0s)]
*  But you are often there. You have a front row seat. What are you seeing on the ground? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=73.0s)]
*  So up until this point, we've been lobbying for weeks and weeks to try to get into Gaza, Gayle, but it just hasn't been possible. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=78.0s)]
*  Basically, the borders have been blocked by Israeli officials, by Egyptian officials. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=88.0s)]
*  And so the reporting that's been done up until now has been done by the extraordinarily brave journalists of Gaza who have been paying an incredibly high price. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=93.0s)]
*  More than 60 journalists killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, since this round of hostilities began. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=103.0s)]
*  That is truly an extraordinary number. We enjoyed a very privileged position on this trip. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=111.0s)]
*  We went in for a short window. There was deconfliction preparation that went into it to ensure our security and the security of the UAE medical volunteers, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=117.0s)]
*  the Emirati medical volunteers who we went in with to their field hospital. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=130.0s)]
*  But still, even in that brief window, Gayle, you really got a sense of the absolute horrors that have been taking place in Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=134.0s)]
*  This hospital was filled with the youngest victims of this war, children who have been disfigured, who are in full body casts, who are covered in burns, according to the United Nations. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=143.0s)]
*  Some two-thirds of the deaths that have happened since Israel retaliated after the horrific October 7 attacks with this massive bombardment. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=156.0s)]
*  Two-thirds of the victims have been women and children. And we definitely saw that borne out in this hospital. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=168.0s)]
*  There was a strike just minutes after we arrived near the hospital. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=176.0s)]
*  Two casualties brought in, a 13-year-old boy who had lost half his leg, an older man with his foot hanging off. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=181.0s)]
*  And so it was chilling. It was harrowing and a very sobering experience to see just how difficult life is on the ground. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=189.0s)]
*  And once you see it, Clarissa, you cannot unsee it, but I'm just struck by something you said. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=202.0s)]
*  You said there was a strike there at the hospital while you were there. What happens? What do you do in that situation? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=207.0s)]
*  What does that mean exactly? In the movies you see it, it looks like the whole place is decimated. What happens? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=213.0s)]
*  Well, I think the most interesting thing about it, Gayle, was that it was very loud. I can't say exactly how close it was. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=223.0s)]
*  But the doctor who was showing me around didn't even flinch. He turned to me and he said, this is our everyday. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=228.0s)]
*  This happens about 20 times a day. And then minutes later he gets a phone call saying the first casualties are coming in. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=235.0s)]
*  Because this field hospital that the United Arab Emirates has set up near the southern border is literally, Gayle, the only hospital with empty beds in Gaza. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=243.0s)]
*  And so what's happening is that these casualties will be rushed to one hospital. They will tie some kind of a makeshift tourniquet. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=255.0s)]
*  They don't even have tourniquets left most of these hospitals. And then they get brought to this field hospital, which is state of the art, which has MRIs, which has supplies coming in on a regular basis, although it is still a challenge every single day. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=263.0s)]
*  And so this has become part of the fabric of daily life for ordinary Gazans. It's not something you can ever truly get used to, particularly when you see the scale of the suffering, when you see the fact that it's women and children who are largely bearing the brunt of it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=279.0s)]
*  But there's a sense in Gaza right now that nobody has time to even take a breath. You just have to keep going, keep moving, keep trying to save lives to the best of your ability. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=296.0s)]
*  And I do think it's important to underscore as well, Gayle, that for the people of Gaza, we get to leave at the end of our visits. They do not. They have no way of going out and they have no safe place to go to. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=307.0s)]
*  And they are facing a level of bombardment that does not have a precedent in modern warfare. It is truly a catastrophe, Gayle. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=320.0s)]
*  How is the humanitarian aid getting through to all the people? I know that was a big question mark we've been talking about over here for a while. Is any humanitarian aid getting through? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=329.0s)]
*  So, Charles, some aid is getting through, but just nowhere near the volume that needs to be getting through. There's this one border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, the Ra'afah border crossing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=339.0s)]
*  It is totally overwhelmed. It was never built to deal with this capacity. When you approach that border, you just see miles and miles of trucks lining up, hundreds of them that are laden with this aid that is so desperately needed. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=355.0s)]
*  And even when they manage to cut through the bureaucracy and go through the various inspections and get into Gaza, the problem, according to aid workers, is they can't actually distribute the aid to where it needs to go because the bombardment is so ferocious, because it is so dangerous to make road moves around Gaza at the moment. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=370.0s)]
*  And so essentially, these aid workers are completely hamstrung, and the ordinary people are very much cut off from the basic necessities, whether it's food, whether it's medicine. I talked to the doctors again. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=392.0s)]
*  They said, we're getting injuries in here and illnesses that should be relatively easy to treat, but by the time they reach us, we're looking at severe cases of sepsis, of infection, simply because the hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza are not getting the aid they need. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=405.0s)]
*  The people are completely overwhelmed. The bottom has fallen out in the health care system. And so you're seeing things that should be easy to deal with turn into life-threatening diseases, illnesses, and infections. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=422.0s)]
*  So, before you go, listen, I remember when you had your first child, and now you're the mother of three. And I've often wondered this about you. When I described you as a badass, I really mean that because I've seen you in action. I know how you work. I know how hard you work. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=436.0s)]
*  How are you so fearless? Are you ever afraid? Are you ever afraid? And do you feel safe when you're there? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=451.0s)]
*  First of all, I just have to say, Gail, that honestly, the real badasses are the journalists in Gaza who are doing this, who are getting killed and injured every single day, the doctors who are staying in these hospitals that are getting bombed, where there is a complete breakdown, and continue with no sleep, with very little support, to do whatever they can to try to help their own people. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=462.0s)]
*  And so, when we enjoyed a very privileged position on this occasion, we did feel relatively safe. We were only on the ground for a matter of hours. But as a war correspondent who's been doing this for almost 20 years now, and particularly as a mother, you never get used to seeing children who have been maimed, who have been disfigured, who have lost their entire families. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=489.0s)]
*  And I can honestly say, I don't think we've ever seen it quite on this scale as what we are seeing take place on the ground in Gaza right now. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=513.0s)]
*  All right, Klosar, I think you're being very modest about what you do, because you put yourself in harm's way. I know that there have been times that it's been very dicey for you. But I appreciate you talking about the bravery of others, but I also know the job that you do. Thank you so much, and we really hope that you will stay safe. Can't wait to see you again. Thank you so much. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=540.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkxXpCiYI0U&t=564.0s)]
