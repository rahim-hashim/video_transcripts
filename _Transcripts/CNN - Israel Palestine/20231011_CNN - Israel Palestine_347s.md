# CNN reporter lays out Israel's evaluation of Iran's alleged involvement in the Hamas attacks
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w)
*  U.S. officials are saying in terms of what started this attack and possibly what could [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=0.0s)]
*  determine how much bigger this conflict gets. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  U.S. officials are saying that there's no proof or suggestion of direct Iranian involvement. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=6.4s)]
*  What are you learning? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=13.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean, in general terms, Israeli officials that I've spoken to agree with that [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=14.44s)]
*  assessment in the sense that they're saying, look, the backdrop of this is that Iran provides [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=18.88s)]
*  material support, training, political support for Hamas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=25.76s)]
*  But there is a difference. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=28.92s)]
*  There's a gap between what you just said then and what Israeli intelligence is suggesting. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=30.12s)]
*  They're saying to me, a senior Israeli official telling me earlier, that Iran green-lighted [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=35.56s)]
*  the idea of this operation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=40.68s)]
*  Didn't know about the timing, perhaps. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=42.68s)]
*  Didn't quite understand, perhaps, as many of us didn't, the consequences of what this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=44.36s)]
*  operation would be, but knew this operation was in the offing and that it was being planned. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  And that's very different to having no involvement whatsoever. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=53.2s)]
*  It's not that Iran is pulling the strings, but it's somewhere in the middle. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=56.12s)]
*  So General Hodges, a senior Hamas official is now claiming that they spent two years, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=59.72s)]
*  two years, I mean, it's amazing to think about that, as Matthew and I are standing here, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=64.8s)]
*  two years preparing for this unprecedented attack on Israel, and that it did have financial [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=67.52s)]
*  as well as weapons support from Iran, also saying that Russia reached out after the attack. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=72.08s)]
*  So General Hodges, when you put all this together, how significant is this? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=77.48s)]
*  That's just the involvement that they are saying they had from both Russia and Iran. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=80.72s)]
*  But also the length of time that they are saying they planned this that Israel did not [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=85.72s)]
*  see it coming. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=90.24s)]
*  So Aaron, I think this is Russia opening up a second front. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, what's going on now is distracting so much attention and even resources away [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=98.0s)]
*  from Ukraine, which of course benefits Russia. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=103.6s)]
*  Nobody even has mentioned Ukraine, hardly, in the last 96 hours. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=107.6s)]
*  I think it's probably accurate when the administration says there is no direct involvement, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=112.48s)]
*  but the way you and Matt have laid it out, it's the green lighting, the weapons, the, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I watched the training video of these guys, what they were doing to prepare for [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=123.4s)]
*  this attack. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=126.84s)]
*  This is not something you do in your garage or your basement. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=127.84s)]
*  I mean, this is really high quality effort on the side of Hamas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=130.56s)]
*  And Matthew, you know, we're talking, you know, I was talking to someone today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=138.32s)]
*  I mean, there's stories about IDF fighters taking on, you know, eight to ten of these [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=140.44s)]
*  fighters and fighting for hours and hours and hand to hand combat. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  But this was also going on for quite some time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=149.8s)]
*  These were not just highly motivated, but highly prepared and highly armed individuals. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=152.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=158.88s)]
*  I mean, this has been an incredible shock, Aaron, of course, to the people of Israel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=159.88s)]
*  They're enraged by it. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  And of course, it's been surprising as well. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=165.6s)]
*  And I think it's probably surprising for Hamas as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=167.44s)]
*  I mean, they, you know, from what I've been hearing, it's not entirely clear. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=171.0s)]
*  They thought they were going to be so successful if I can use those terms. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=177.16s)]
*  Perhaps they wanted to get some Israeli hostages. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=181.0s)]
*  Perhaps they wanted to use that to negotiate better terms in Gaza. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=183.6s)]
*  But where they've gone to has led to the brink of utter catastrophe for them and for Gaza. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=186.76s)]
*  General Hodges, when you think about what we actually saw on the border today, right [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=192.56s)]
*  along that border three miles away, very blatant massing of Israeli forces, they're busing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=197.39999999999998s)]
*  them in. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  We saw all of that on the ridge. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  We heard heavy outgoing fire. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=204.28s)]
*  We heard the fighter jets and the explosions and we saw them in Gaza. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=206.04s)]
*  And then at one point, 60 rockets came in. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=209.44s)]
*  It was a barrage. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=213.12s)]
*  It was an onslaught. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=214.72s)]
*  That's the tempo that we experienced throughout the afternoon today. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=216.16s)]
*  General Hodges, what does this say to you about what is next? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you sustain this sort of back and forth if something isn't imminently about to occur? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=223.6s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm putting myself in the shoes of the commander of the, say, a battalion [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=227.84s)]
*  commander or company commander. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=234.16s)]
*  And I want to know what is my mission. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=235.56s)]
*  Soldiers cannot stay in a crouch or coiled like this indefinitely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=238.84s)]
*  So what you have shown very clearly is that they are in this crouch getting ready for [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=243.88s)]
*  something. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=249.64s)]
*  Are they going in there to do a punitive strike, go in for a few days, kill as many Hamas as [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  they can? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=256.76s)]
*  Or is this going to end up in an occupation that maybe lasts for several months? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  That's a different sort of thing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=263.84s)]
*  That's what I would want to know if I was the commander. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=266.12s)]
*  What's the end state we're going, we're being sent in to achieve? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=268.32s)]
*  No matter which, either of these two possibilities, it's going to be very, very difficult. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=273.96s)]
*  You pointed out the bulldozers. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  The Israelis are probably as good as anybody in the world at using bulldozers and other [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=281.52s)]
*  capabilities inside a densely packed, densely populated area like this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  They know how to do this. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=293.68s)]
*  But even with that, it's still going to be very costly. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=295.4s)]
*  And Matthew, as you have spent so much time in Ukraine and we were there as the war began, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  there are more than double the number of troops that Putin had at one point on that border [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=306.08s)]
*  at the beginning along this border with Gaza. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  A very small, everything here is in a very small space. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  Just to give everyone a sense of the massive force that is prepared. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=316.88s)]
*  They're going to need overwhelming force because Gaza is one of the most densely populated [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=319.88s)]
*  areas in the world. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=324.36s)]
*  It's got thin, narrow streets, terrible fighting conditions. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=325.36s)]
*  It's crisscrossed by a network of tunnels that are controlled by Hamas. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=329.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=334.56s)]
*  The other thing is 150 hostages, remember, inside Gaza. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=335.56s)]
*  That's got to complicate any kind of military operation. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=338.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=342.16s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=343.16s)]
*  Well, General Hodges, thank you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=344.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=345.16s)]
*  And Matthew, thank you very much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy9fD07y4-w&t=346.16s)]
