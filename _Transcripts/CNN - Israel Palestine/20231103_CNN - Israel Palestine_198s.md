# How Hamas is attempting to control the narrative
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs)
*  We're now on what Hamas has been saying to the world on Arabic language programs in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=0.0s)]
*  and what its spokesmen and leaders are not saying when confronted with the barbarity of its attacks on civilians on October 7th. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Randy Kaye has that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=10.52s)]
*  The existence of Israel is illogical. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=14.56s)]
*  Hamas trying to control the narrative in television interviews, most of them with Arabic TV stations. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=17.48s)]
*  The existence of Israel is what causes all that pain, blood and tears. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=23.88s)]
*  That's Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, speaking out on Lebanese TV. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=29.8s)]
*  In the clip, he squarely blames Israel for causing the October massacre carried out by Hamas that left more than 1,400 people dead. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=35.04s)]
*  It is Israel, not us. We are victims of the occupation, period. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=43.72s)]
*  Therefore, nobody should blame us for the things we do. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=47.88s)]
*  On October 7th, October 10th, October 1 million, everything we do is justified. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=50.6s)]
*  We must teach Israel a lesson and we will do this again and again. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=56.28s)]
*  The Al Aqsa flood is just the first time and there will be a second, a third, a fourth, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=59.72s)]
*  because we have the determination, the resolve and the capabilities to fight. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=64.24s)]
*  Playing the role of victim, the terror organization, designated a terror group by the US, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=69.6s)]
*  is trying to convince people around the world that Hamas' attack on Israel was justified. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=75.36s)]
*  Despite its own random killing of hundreds of unarmed Israeli civilians and committing barbaric acts, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=81.44s)]
*  one Hamas leader spun Israel's retaliation, this way in a speech. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  We assure the enemy and whoever is behind it that your pathetic attempts to conceal your own defeat [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=94.84s)]
*  by committing barbaric massacres against unarmed civilians with villainy [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=104.8s)]
*  will not save you from resounding defeat in the Al Aqsa flood. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=108.84s)]
*  And those hostages Hamas is holding in Gaza? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=112.6s)]
*  Hamas, in trying to soften its image, now refers to them as guests. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=115.44s)]
*  We keep a diverse group of individuals currently under temporary custody, hailing from different nationalities. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  These individuals are considered our esteemed guests and our primary goal is to ensure their safety. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=127.0s)]
*  This Hamas leader also used Arabic TV to make the video. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=133.0s)]
*  We did not want to harm civilians, but there were complications on the ground [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=137.56s)]
*  and there was a party in the area with population. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=141.64s)]
*  It was a large area across 40 kilometers. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=144.28s)]
*  And when facts came out that Hamas was trying to kill Israeli civilians, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=147.72s)]
*  the video was not enough to show that they were doing it on purpose. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=151.88s)]
*  We did not want to harm civilians, but there were complications on the ground [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  and there was a party in the area with population. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  It was a large area across 40 kilometers. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=162.6s)]
*  And when facts get in the way of Hamas's message, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=166.44s)]
*  like during this interview with the BBC, Hamas shuts down the interview. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=169.48s)]
*  I can tell you that we didn't have any intention or decision to kill the civilians. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=174.36s)]
*  How do you justify killing people as they sleep? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=182.52s)]
*  You know, families, how do you justify killing hundreds of people? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=186.76s)]
*  I want to stop this interview. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=190.04s)]
*  I want to stop this interview. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCwNGCpjfrs&t=192.04s)]
