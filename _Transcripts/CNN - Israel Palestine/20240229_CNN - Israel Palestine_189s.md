*  eyewitnesses and the Hamas run [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestinian Ministry of Health say [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=1.96s)]
*  that more than 100 people were killed [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=3.72s)]
*  in what is being described as a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=6.04s)]
*  chaotic incident as IDF soldiers [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=8.08s)]
*  opened fire as people were trying [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=9.68s)]
*  to get food from aid trucks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=11.72s)]
*  CNN's Jeremy Diamond is gathering new details. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=13.56s)]
*  He's been picking up some new reporting. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=15.8s)]
*  Jeremy bring us up to speed here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=17.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, kid, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=22.92s)]
*  I think it's important to note [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=24.28s)]
*  that the aid situation, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=25.84s)]
*  the humanitarian situation in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=26.96s)]
*  northern Gaza is just so so desperate, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=28.2s)]
*  and that seems to be part of what [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  led to this scene hundreds, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=32.48s)]
*  if not thousands of people surrounding [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=34.12s)]
*  some of these aid trucks that were [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=36.04s)]
*  able to enter northern Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=38.04s)]
*  Some of the very few aid trucks that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  have actually been able to make it in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=41.92s)]
*  there and you can see in this video [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=43.8s)]
*  by the Israeli from the Israeli military. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=45.8s)]
*  The crowds of people around these trucks, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=47.4s)]
*  but what appears to have happened is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=49.84s)]
*  that the Israeli military opened fire [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=51.84s)]
*  on some of these people who are [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=53.72s)]
*  surrounding these trucks and Israeli [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=55.96s)]
*  military official telling us that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=57.72s)]
*  the crowd approached the forces in a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=59.32s)]
*  manner that posed a threat to the troops. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=61.32s)]
*  And they say that those troops [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=63.36s)]
*  then responded with live fire. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=65.12s)]
*  Now eyewitnesses on the scene have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=66.76s)]
*  told us that Israeli tanks as well as [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=68.56s)]
*  drones opened fire on this crowd and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=70.96s)]
*  that following that there was a chaotic scene. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=73.28s)]
*  Some of the drivers of these [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=75.92s)]
*  a trucks apparently tried to get [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=78.28s)]
*  away amid this gunfire and killed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=80.48s)]
*  several additional people. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=82.64s)]
*  We were told that a whole lot of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=83.88s)]
*  people were killed in this incident. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  760 people injured according to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=88.72s)]
*  the Palestinian Ministry of Health. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=90.56s)]
*  It's not clear yet how many of those [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=92.56s)]
*  were killed by Israeli gunfire versus [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  by these trucks and the ensuing chaos. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  But our eyewitnesses on the ground [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=99.92s)]
*  indicate that it was the Israeli gunfire [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=102.04s)]
*  that prompted some of those trucks to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=104.60000000000001s)]
*  flee the scene and in the process run [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  over some of these individuals. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  But we are still working to gather [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=111.84s)]
*  additional details about the incident [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=114.36000000000001s)]
*  and the Israeli military says for [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=116.36s)]
*  its part that the incident is under review. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=118.44s)]
*  And they are also saying in a statement [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=120.8s)]
*  that Gazan residents surrounded the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  trucks looted the supplies being [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=124.6s)]
*  delivered and that during the incident, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=126.16s)]
*  dozens of Gazans they say were injured [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=128.08s)]
*  as a result of pushing and trampling. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=130.12s)]
*  This was clearly more than just [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=131.96s)]
*  pushing and trampling and we have [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=133.76s)]
*  eyewitnesses making very clear that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=135.52s)]
*  the Israeli military did indeed open [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=137.4s)]
*  fire on these individuals as well. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=139.68s)]
*  Now we should note that this is only [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=142.76s)]
*  because of how desperate the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=145.64s)]
*  humanitarian situation is in northern Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=147.6s)]
*  Very few aid trucks have actually [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=149.88s)]
*  been able to make it in there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=151.55999999999997s)]
*  The World Food Program recently [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  suspended aid deliveries to northern [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=154.76s)]
*  Gaza saying that it was too unsafe. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=156.39999999999998s)]
*  Part of that has to do with a lack of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=158.83999999999997s)]
*  coordination with the Israeli military [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=161.0s)]
*  to get those trucks into a war zone [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=162.92s)]
*  safely in a way that they are not targeted. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=165.16s)]
*  And it also has to do with the fact that [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=167.67999999999998s)]
*  the Israeli military in the past has [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=169.88s)]
*  targeted police officers who have been [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  around those aid convoys and so there [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=173.88s)]
*  is very little security for these. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=176.2s)]
*  You combine that lack of security. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=178.2s)]
*  You combine that with the fact that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=180.12s)]
*  people are on the brink of famine [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=181.96s)]
*  in northern Gaza and then the Israeli [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=183.92s)]
*  military also being on the scene and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=185.96s)]
*  this is the situation that appears [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=187.92s)]
*  to have arisen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywOzeZl7uIU&t=189.6s)]
