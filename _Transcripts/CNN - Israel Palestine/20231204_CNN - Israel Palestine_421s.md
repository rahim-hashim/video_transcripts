# Israel expands ground operations to all of Gaza as fears of wider conflict grow
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw)
*  This morning we are watching growing threats of the Israel Hamas war spreading into a much [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=0.0s)]
*  wider conflict. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=4.88s)]
*  New overnight, the Israeli military ramping up air strikes after announcing it was expanding [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=6.22s)]
*  its ground assault to the entire Gaza Strip, including in the south. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=10.86s)]
*  That is where so many civilians have fled. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=15.14s)]
*  The IDF says the strikes destroyed 200 Hamas targets. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=17.76s)]
*  That happening as the, in the Red Sea, the U.S. Navy destroyer came to the rescue of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  three commercial Strip ships that were attacked by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=25.04s)]
*  The Pentagon says the destroyer shot down drones and one of the commercial ships was [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=29.24s)]
*  attacked with a ballistic missile. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=32.68s)]
*  We're also keeping a close eye on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, where Israeli [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=34.4s)]
*  forces have been exchanging fire with Hezbollah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=38.2s)]
*  This morning, the IDF says three Israeli soldiers were hurt by mortar shells fired from Lebanon. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=40.4s)]
*  We have team coverage from Jerusalem to the White House and the Pentagon, but let's start [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=46.3s)]
*  with CNN's Ben Wiedemann in Jerusalem. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=50.18s)]
*  Ben, Israel expanding the operation to the entire Gaza Strip over the weekend. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=52.68s)]
*  The biggest question right now, where are the civilians that have all moved to the south [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=57.1s)]
*  at the IDF's request supposed to go? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=61.08s)]
*  Well, that's, I think, a question, Phil, that many people in Gaza are asking because we [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=65.9s)]
*  know that more than 80% of the population of Gaza is already displaced. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=69.56s)]
*  Many have gone to the south. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=74.98s)]
*  Now, the Israelis have over social media put out a map showing hundreds of individual blocks [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=76.1s)]
*  that are numbered and in theory, people can go onto that map. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=82.1s)]
*  There's a QR code and know where is safe, where is not. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=86.5s)]
*  The problem is most people in Gaza don't have electricity to charge their phones, don't [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=91.3s)]
*  have an internet connection, and therefore, they're very much really left to their own [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=96.42s)]
*  devices. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=102.02s)]
*  And, of course, another problem is already the shelters, the schools that have been converted [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=103.02s)]
*  into shelters in Gaza are already crammed with people, as many as 400 to 500 people [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=107.5s)]
*  per toilet, if there's even a toilet. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=113.22s)]
*  And therefore, when they hear that the Israelis are going to expand their ground operations [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  to the entirety of the Gaza Strip, that really doesn't leave anything anywhere for anybody [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=120.92s)]
*  to go that could possibly be safe. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=127.8s)]
*  Phil, Poppy? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  We saw on Saturday fighting in the north of Israel across the border with Lebanon with [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=133.0s)]
*  Hezbollah. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=138.32s)]
*  Hezbollah saying one of their fighters was killed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=139.32s)]
*  You've spent so much time reporting in Lebanon on Hezbollah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  What does that indicate to you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=147.0s)]
*  Does that indicate the beginning of a broader expansion of this to the north and more broadly [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=148.0s)]
*  between not just Israel and Hamas, but Israel and Hezbollah? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=153.4s)]
*  Well, starting on the 8th of October, Hezbollah basically entered into this fight with limited [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=157.4s)]
*  strikes on Israeli positions in some communities on the other side of the border. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=165.54s)]
*  But it's worth noting that during the seven-day truce, they also observed the truce. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=172.94s)]
*  They did not open fire. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=176.74s)]
*  But what we've seen since the truce broke down on Friday morning is that there's been [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  a real intensification of the back-and-forth fire between Hezbollah and the Israelis. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  I've been in touch with Ivan Watson, who's our correspondent in south Lebanon. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=189.9s)]
*  At the moment, he says there are, there's hourly shelling back and forth. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  And that seems to be far more intense than what we were witnessing when I spent several [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=199.18s)]
*  weeks in south Lebanon before the truce went into effect. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=203.66s)]
*  Papi? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=207.62s)]
*  It's quite telling. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=208.62s)]
*  Ben Wiedemann reporting for us in Jerusalem. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=209.9s)]
*  Thank you very much, Phil. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  Well, Papi, as Ben was just talking about, those exchanges in the north, just the latest [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  example that every hour, the threat that America could get dragged directly into the war seems [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=217.22s)]
*  to grow. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=222.42s)]
*  This morning, the U.S. military says a U.S. Navy destroyer and three commercial ships were [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=223.42s)]
*  attacked in an hours-long assault from the Red Sea. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=227.56s)]
*  The U.S. says the attackers launched ballistic missiles and drones that hit three ships linked [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=230.6s)]
*  to several countries, including Israel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=234.28s)]
*  The Navy sent the USS Carney to respond and shoot down those drones in self-defense. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=236.72s)]
*  The U.S. blaming the attack on rebels backed by Iran operating in Yemen. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=240.6s)]
*  It is the largest attack targeting ships in the region, and it's stoking fears of a wider [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=244.6s)]
*  conflict. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=249.12s)]
*  I want to bring in CNN's Natasha Berchrand, who joins us live from the Pentagon. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=250.12s)]
*  And Natasha, before I start with you, just to give kind of an example for people on the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=252.6s)]
*  map of where this is all happening. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=256.44s)]
*  Obviously, Israel up here, Ben talking about what's happening in the north near Lebanon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=258.0s)]
*  Syria is also an area where proxies have been operating. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=262.0s)]
*  We're talking specifically in this area here, the Red Sea down in Yemen, which also has [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=264.32s)]
*  proxy organizations tied to Iran. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=268.67999999999995s)]
*  They have been a significant player in the dozens of attacks on U.S. ships, on other [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=270.52s)]
*  commercial ships over the course of the last several weeks. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  I think the big question right now, particularly in the wake of those hostage negotiations [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  breaking down, that pause coming to an end. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=282.34s)]
*  Is this a sign that an escalation is coming, or is this just a return to what we saw the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=284.82s)]
*  six or seven weeks before that pause? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=289.06s)]
*  Well, look, Phil, this was a particularly active day, to say the least, in the southern [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  Red Sea, with the U.S. as Kearney responding to multiple attacks by what the U.S. Central [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=296.26s)]
*  Command says are these Iran-backed Houthi rebels who operate in Yemen. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=301.46s)]
*  And this is certainly an escalation from what we have seen in the past. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=306.46s)]
*  This was a number of attacks, four attacks on three separate commercial vessels in the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=310.46s)]
*  southern Red Sea, including one attack in which the Houthis used a ballistic missile. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=315.18s)]
*  Now, the U.S. as Kearney responded to each of these attacks, which occurred yesterday [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=320.65999999999997s)]
*  at, on Sunday at several different times throughout the day. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=326.26s)]
*  And many of them actually resulted in damage to these commercial vessels in the southern [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  Red Sea. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=334.17999999999995s)]
*  And the U.S. now says that this is really, really dangerous, obviously. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=335.17999999999995s)]
*  Not only did the U.S. as Kearney respond to these attacks, but they also shot down a [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=339.3s)]
*  number of drones that were launched from these Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen, according [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=343.3s)]
*  to Central Command. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=349.66s)]
*  So clearly, they're taking advantage right now of the tumult in the region, of all of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=350.66s)]
*  the U.S. presence in the region to try to attack these ships. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=356.06s)]
*  And the Houthi-run Yemeni Armed Forces actually acknowledged these attacks in a statement [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=360.54s)]
*  yesterday saying that they will continue to wage these attacks against these, quote, Israeli [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=366.02000000000004s)]
*  ships and those aligned with Israel standing in solidarity, they say, with the Palestinians. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  But look, in a statement, U.S. Central Command said that these attacks represent a, quote, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=375.02000000000004s)]
*  direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=379.86s)]
*  They said they have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing dozens, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  multiple countries around the world, as many as 14 different countries. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=388.78000000000003s)]
*  And importantly, they said that they have every reason to believe that these attacks [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=392.46000000000004s)]
*  are fully enabled by Iran. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=397.1s)]
*  Now, the big question is how the U.S. is going to respond. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=399.1s)]
*  Of course, we have seen the U.S. military strike these Iran-backed groups in Iraq and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  Syria over the last several weeks. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=406.54s)]
*  But Yemen, whether they are going to go after the Houthis in Yemen, that remains an entirely [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=408.26s)]
*  different question. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=412.98s)]
*  But they said that they will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=413.98s)]
*  with allies and partners. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=417.74s)]
*  Phil. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=418.74s)]
*  Natasha Berchrein for the Pentagon. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=419.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGYbyvZdLVw&t=420.74s)]
