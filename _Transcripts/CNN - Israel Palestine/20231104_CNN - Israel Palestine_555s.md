**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA)
*  They put us on the ground and said, stay here, don't move. If you move, you're dead. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=0.0s)]
*  And they took all the knives that we had, said, don't do anything stupid. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=6.16s)]
*  And meanwhile, my kid, my 11 year old, she started communicating with the commander, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=14.96s)]
*  asking him, why are you doing this? Why did you kill my sister? And he said, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=25.6s)]
*  don't worry, your sister is with Allah. She's safe now. She's with Allah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=30.96s)]
*  Tzachi all this time cannot talk. He's shocked. He's not functioning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=36.56s)]
*  Because he saw his kid dead and was just holding his head and crying. And I was looking at him, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  when you have this impression of nothing behind it, it was like that. Tzachi is [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=51.12s)]
*  one of the strongest men I know. Every time that something happens, he's the one that holds the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=58.96s)]
*  situation. It was painful to see him like that. And then they said, okay, you and you, and they [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=66.32s)]
*  were pointing at Tzachi and Omri and said, you and you get up. You're coming with us. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=76.72s)]
*  And they cuffed his hand with white stripes and barefooted also, I think. And they said, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=83.44s)]
*  okay, you're coming with us. And they took them. They were in front of the back door. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=92.08s)]
*  They asked, whose car is it? And Tzachi said, this is my car. To us, they said, okay, stay on [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=98.0s)]
*  the ground or you'll be killed. We'll shoot you or you'll be dead. So we stayed. We told our [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=106.24s)]
*  husbands, Lisha and me, we said, we said, we love you. Don't do anything stupid. Don't be a hero. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  Just do what they say, please. And the kids started yelling, don't take him. Thank him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=123.84s)]
*  And they said, no, no, it's okay. He'll be back. He'll be back. They promised the kids he'll be back. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=130.64s)]
*  We couldn't do anything. And it was until, I think, 5.30 in the afternoon that we heard [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=138.88s)]
*  people talking around us, you know, and we just looked outside, peeked outside. Lisha [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=150.32s)]
*  peeked outside and said, there's somebody walking around the house. They said, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=158.0s)]
*  which is IDF, IDF. They are actually our saviors. They took us out of the house, actually. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=163.28s)]
*  But the kids didn't want to go. They said, please, I don't want anybody else to be dead [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  in this house. I don't want anybody else to get murdered. The kids didn't want to go. It took me [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  20 minutes outside the kibbutz just to breathe because I couldn't breathe all the way. I held [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=182.56s)]
*  shakhar on me and Yael near me. And we went out like this. Sorry. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=189.84s)]
*  You're an 11-year-old daughter and your 9-year-old son. And Tzachi had already been taken, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=198.0s)]
*  already been kidnapped. And Maayan, your daughter, was dead. And her body was left in the house. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=203.6s)]
*  It was left in the house. I couldn't, they didn't let us go there. We asked them to go to see Maayan, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=209.36s)]
*  the terrorist. They didn't let me see my daughter before I went. They didn't. I couldn't. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=215.6s)]
*  I couldn't say goodbye. I couldn't. She stayed there for three days. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  In the house. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=229.12s)]
*  Her body, yes. In a pile of blood, you know, on the floor. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=229.68s)]
*  Your kids, Yael and shakhar, they're okay? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=233.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=235.84s)]
*  Define okay. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=237.04s)]
*  You tell me. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=238.72s)]
*  It's like sanity in insanity. It's one day is up and one day is down. They cry. They miss their dad. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  They're 9 and 11 years old. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=254.24s)]
*  Yes. We buried Maayan a week and a half ago. They were there and it was, I think they had to do it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=255.84s)]
*  for the closure because I don't think you understand at that age, death. I don't think [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=266.0s)]
*  you understand that your sister is dead without seeing. And actually, I hope they didn't see. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=272.64s)]
*  The funeral was some kind of closure and they miss her. Shakhar painted a picture that he could [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=281.52s)]
*  bury with Maayan and Yael was really, really, you know, quiet and didn't want to come. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=290.16s)]
*  They didn't want to see it. It was a closed casket, of course. You couldn't see it and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=302.56s)]
*  they wanted to hug her and they wanted to, you know, just better hair, her curls, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  and hold her hand and they couldn't. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=315.92s)]
*  They rolled her sister. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=318.24s)]
*  Yes. And they admired her. She was a loving kind. She was a ray of light. She was pure, pure good. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=319.84s)]
*  Seriously, she was so good. I don't understand how can you kill? It's like killing a unicorn. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=329.28s)]
*  You can never kill a unicorn. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=335.84s)]
*  But now we're really united and focused about bringing Tzachih home, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=340.8s)]
*  alive and well. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=348.72s)]
*  What do you think? Is it hopeful that he will come home? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=349.68s)]
*  Yeah, he will come home. He will come home to us. Yes. He has to, alive and well. Yes. The way he [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=353.92s)]
*  got out. I hope so. I know so. He will. I'll do anything, anything in my power or everybody's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=362.8s)]
*  power. I will use everybody's power just to bring him and all of the hostages home, but him [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=373.6s)]
*  especially. Yes. He's my husband. He's my better half. He's my stronger half. I need him. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=380.48s)]
*  He needs to mourn his daughter. He needs to hug his kids. He didn't do anything to deserve this. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=387.6s)]
*  Nothing. Peaceful man. He just, you know, lived in the kibbutz. He was Jewish and lived in the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  kibbutz. That's it. That's the reason. That's the reason Mayan was murdered. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=402.32s)]
*  Hateful. Just pure hate. Pure hate. Nothing. Nothing more. She didn't do anything. What an [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=408.64s)]
*  18 year old playing volleyball in love with her boyfriend can do. What did she do to them? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=415.6s)]
*  Nothing. Just living in the kibbutz on the border of Gaza. That's the problem. That's her fault. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=423.12s)]
*  That's why she was murdered. Yes. That's why everybody was murdered because it was a slaughter. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=429.84s)]
*  They killed women and children. They have a nine month year old baby out there. How can you take, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=436.47999999999996s)]
*  what did he do to you? What? What did he do to you? Nothing. Is he a soldier? What did he do to you? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=442.96s)]
*  What did he do to you? They have grandmothers. 85 year old Alma, which is my neighbor, she's sick. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=450.72s)]
*  She needed medicine. They took 15 year old Daphna and 80 year old Ela. They killed her father and [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=459.6s)]
*  her almost stepmother and stepbrother. They shot him in the back. How do you do it? Why? And they [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  did nothing. They weren't armed. They weren't, nothing, nothing. Purely hate. That was, that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=479.2s)]
*  would happen. It's, it's, and, and we know that that cannot be. We had it a long time ago. We said [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=488.8s)]
*  never again. And it did happen. It did. So I'm asking everybody, everybody, everybody in the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=500.56s)]
*  world, in the U.S., everybody that can help stop this hatred, stop these crimes, bring, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=508.88s)]
*  bring them home. Bring the hostage home. Please. Your beautiful 18 year old daughter, Mayan. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  That's Mayan. As we say, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=525.68s)]
*  May her memory be a blessing. And this is Tzachi. And Tzachi, let's hope that Tzachi, 49 year old [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=530.88s)]
*  dad, a father who's been kidnapped, being held in Gaza by Hamas, let's hope he comes home soon. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=535.8399999999999s)]
*  Yes. When they, when he comes home, let me know. I'd like to come meet him. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=542.64s)]
*  Okay. I will. I will. Thank you. Thank you so much. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dmZeLBauyA&t=546.64s)]
