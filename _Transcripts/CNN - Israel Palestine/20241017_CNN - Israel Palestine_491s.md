# ‘Justice has been served’: Harris reacts to reports of Sinwar’s death
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k)
*  We do want to go to Vice President Harris, who is now reacting to this news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=4.16s)]
*  VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENTAL COUNCIL MEMBER, UNITED STATES, UNITED STATES [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=6.12s)]
*  TODAY, ISRAEL CONFIRMED THAT YAHYA SINWAR, THE LEADER OF HAMAS IS DEAD, AND JUSTICE HAS [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=11.56s)]
*  BEEN SERVED. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=18.84s)]
*  AND THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL, AND THE ENTIRE WORLD ARE BETTER OFF AS A RESULT. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=19.84s)]
*  Sinwar was responsible for the killing of thousands of innocent people, including the [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=27.12s)]
*  victims of October 7 and hostages killed in Gaza. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=32.68s)]
*  He had American blood on his hands. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=37.84s)]
*  Today I can only hope that the families of the victims of Hamas feel a sense and measure [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=41.28s)]
*  of relief. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=48.2s)]
*  Sinwar was the mastermind of October 7, the deadliest day for the Jewish people since [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=50.2s)]
*  the Holocaust. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=56.76s)]
*  A terrorist attack that killed 1,200 innocent people and included horrific sexual violence [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  and more than 250 hostages taken into Gaza, including seven Americans, living and deceased, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=66.32s)]
*  who remain in captivity. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  A terrorist attack that triggered a devastating war in Gaza, a war that has led to unconscionable [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=77.08s)]
*  suffering of many innocent Palestinians and greater instability throughout the Middle [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=85.72s)]
*  East. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=92.88000000000001s)]
*  In the past year, American special operations and intelligence personnel have worked closely [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=94.24000000000001s)]
*  with their Israeli counterparts to locate and track Sinwar and other Hamas leaders. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=101.16s)]
*  And I commend their work. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=108.12s)]
*  And I will say to any terrorist who kills Americans, threatens the American people, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=111.16s)]
*  or threatens our troops or our interests, know this, we will always bring you to justice. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=118.96s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself, and the threat Hamas poses to Israel must be eliminated. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=129.4s)]
*  Today there is clear progress toward that goal. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=136.88s)]
*  Hamas is decimated and its leadership is eliminated. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  This moment gives us an opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=146.56s)]
*  And it must end such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=154.56s)]
*  Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=162.24s)]
*  freedom and self-determination. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=169.76s)]
*  And it is time for the day after to begin without Hamas in power. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=173.28s)]
*  We will not give up on these goals, and I will always work to create a future of peace, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=181.8s)]
*  dignity and security for all. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=188.84s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=192.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=193.08s)]
*  Is the U.S. asking Israel to end the war? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=194.08s)]
*  Listening to Vice President Harris reacting to this news that Yaya Sinwar is dead, killed [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  by the IDF. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=202.44s)]
*  We do have CNN's MJ Lee at the White House, Clarissa Ward as well in London. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=203.44s)]
*  Clarissa, of course, is one of the few Western journalists who has been in Gaza during the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  war. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=212.4s)]
*  But, MJ, I do want to go to you first. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=213.4s)]
*  You have some new reporting about how families of American hostages being held by Hamas are [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=214.4s)]
*  reacting to news of the death of Sinwar. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=220.04s)]
*  Yeah, and, Brianna, we just heard the vice president referring to the fact that there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=222.28s)]
*  are still seven American hostages, both living and deceased, that are still being held captive [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=234.16s)]
*  These families, including American Israeli hostages that have been taken into Gaza on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=235.68s)]
*  October 7th, I mean, they are watching this development, the news of Yaya Sinwar's death, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=242.16s)]
*  and they are worried sick. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=247.28s)]
*  I was texting earlier with Ruby Hen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  He is, of course, the father of Itai Hen, the young U.S. Israeli American that was taken [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=251.04s)]
*  hostage and killed on October 7th, whose body has yet to be released. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=256.36s)]
*  He was saying, we are very concerned terrorists in the field will do something irrational [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=262.0s)]
*  to the hostages they are holding. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=266.88s)]
*  And he said time is of the essence. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=268.98s)]
*  You know, to say the obvious, the thing that these hostage families want more than anything [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=271.56s)]
*  else is a ceasefire and hostages deal so that all of the hostages can be released. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=276.06s)]
*  And for the past year, you know, this has been a nightmare situation for these families. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=282.06s)]
*  Every day they are waking up hoping that there is some good news on the hostages front and [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=286.74s)]
*  they are now in the position of basically waiting to see and learn whether Sinwar's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=292.46000000000004s)]
*  death ends up prompting a different phase of this conflict, whether it will ultimately [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  mean that the conflict can end. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  But as you all watch Prime Minister Netanyahu and his speech, it certainly didn't sound [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=305.21999999999997s)]
*  like that is where his mind was at. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=310.5s)]
*  But it was very interesting that for the vice president, her focus was very much on the [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=312.78s)]
*  end to this conflict and basically what should happen once the war is over. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=317.82s)]
*  That was clearly her message. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=323.06s)]
*  Clarissa, we noted your reporting from Gaza just a moment ago. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=325.85999999999996s)]
*  I wonder what you think Yaya Sinwar's death means for the enclave, for Palestinians and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=329.5s)]
*  for the region more broadly. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=336.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, Boris, we haven't had any reaction from Hamas yet. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, this is largely expected, but still a big blow for their leadership coming on [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=343.5s)]
*  the heels of the assassination of the former political leader Ismail Haniyeh. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  What's been really interesting, though, is talking to people inside of Gaza about how [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=353.46000000000004s)]
*  they view Sinwar's death. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=358.22s)]
*  And CNN has been talking to people throughout the day. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  And while many people have said that they are sad, there hasn't been the kind of emotional [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=362.94000000000005s)]
*  outpouring, the tears that we saw, for example, with Hassan Nasrallah's death, the leader [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=368.22s)]
*  of Hezbollah or Ismail Haniyeh, who I just mentioned. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  I think that the sense is many Palestinians in Gaza are honestly just focused right now [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=377.22s)]
*  on trying to survive. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  And there are those who will privately speak openly about their hatred of Hamas, about [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=385.9s)]
*  their deep resentment of the immense bloodshed that Yaya Sinwar brought upon the people of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=390.94s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=397.98s)]
*  But in terms of public demonstrations, the thing you're hearing over and over again, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=399.54s)]
*  Boris, is does this mean the end of the war? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=405.74s)]
*  We can't possibly survive this war any longer. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=409.06s)]
*  And it's important to remind our viewers right now that we are talking about a year of relentless [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  bombardment. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=418.16s)]
*  We are talking about 42,000 people dead, the majority of them women, children and civilians. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=419.16s)]
*  We are talking about people starving to death. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=425.48s)]
*  We are talking about disease, the reemergence of polio. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=427.92s)]
*  The situation inside Gaza is absolutely catastrophic and unsustainable. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=432.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's why you saw Vice President Harris saying that while justice has been [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=438.68s)]
*  served, this is a moment to celebrate, this is also an opportunity, a pivotal moment potentially [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=443.36s)]
*  to try to get the hostages released, to try to end this war, to try to get that ceasefire [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=450.28s)]
*  in place. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=455.56s)]
*  But when you listen to Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech, he talked a lot about needing to have [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=456.56s)]
*  patience. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=461.36s)]
*  He talked about the challenges that remained. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=462.36s)]
*  He alluded to the multiple fronts that Israel has opened across the region. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=464.16s)]
*  So no real hope from the people in Gaza that despite the significance of this moment, that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=469.56s)]
*  this will actually fundamentally change the situation on the ground and potentially portend [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=476.72s)]
*  an end to this grisly year-long conflict. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=482.52000000000004s)]
*  That really does put it into perspective. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=486.92s)]
*  Clarissa, thank you so much. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=488.32000000000005s)]
*  MJ, thank you as well. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9SE7mU70k&t=489.96000000000004s)]
