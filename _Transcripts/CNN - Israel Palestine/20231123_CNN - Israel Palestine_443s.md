# John Bolton: Truce is a bad deal for Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU)
*  We are now just hours away from what is supposed to be the start of this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=0.0s)]
*  temporary truce in this war between Israel and Hamas. This deal does not come [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=4.48s)]
*  without criticism. Even here in Israel there have been questions about making [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=9.68s)]
*  this deal. The former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton says is [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=14.4s)]
*  that it is a badly flawed agreement and he joins us now. Thank you so much [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  Ambassador for being here. You have been critical because essentially if I [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=22.68s)]
*  believe this right and tell me if I'm wrong, you think that Hamas gains more [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=26.72s)]
*  from this than Israel does. What exactly about this deal do you think is so bad? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  Well there are many specific provisions that I think are badly misguided but [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=38.12s)]
*  fundamentally what's going on here is that Hamas is playing a game of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=43.32s)]
*  psychological warfare against the people of Israel and the people of the United [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=48.4s)]
*  States as well. They're trying to distract Israel from its strategic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=53.44s)]
*  mission of eliminating Hamas and trying to focus on the question of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=58.32s)]
*  hostages, the question of the condition of civilians in Gaza. Obviously this is [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=64.64s)]
*  a heart-wrenching situation and you can feel nothing but compassion for the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=70.47999999999999s)]
*  families of the hostages but in cold fact Israel's strategic mission here is [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=75.64s)]
*  much more important but if the Hamas effort can help break the morale, can [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=82.2s)]
*  help break the resolve of the Israeli forces, what they really want to do and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=89.12s)]
*  this is the real play is to turn this four-day pause into a permanent ceasefire. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=93.12s)]
*  Now I don't think they're going to achieve that at the first iteration but [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=99.68s)]
*  they're trying to put the onus on the Israeli forces if and when they begin [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=103.56s)]
*  hostilities again. They are playing I think a surprisingly sophisticated [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=107.88s)]
*  psychological game here. I don't think this one event is necessarily going to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=113.28s)]
*  be the Alpha and Omega but if this sets a precedent that undermines Israeli [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=117.64s)]
*  resolve to achieve what they're legitimately entitled to achieve, the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  elimination of Hamas as a threat, it'll be a huge victory for the terrorists. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  So the flip side of that argument and something that I was reading today from [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=134.88s)]
*  Haviv Rettigarad-Ryer here for the Times of Israel in Tel Aviv, he basically [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  believes that Hamas agreed to this deal out of desperation. Why do you think [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  Hamas agreed to this with Israel? Well I think on balance in a military sense [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=148.16s)]
*  Hamas is the beneficiary more than the Israeli side. Certainly as you heard from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  your previous guest, the Israelis are going to move people around, they're [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=161.12s)]
*  going to change troops out, they're going to do a number of things. They will take [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  advantage of the pause as well but it's Hamas that's getting pounded here. I [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=168.44000000000003s)]
*  don't think we know the full amount of devastation that the Israeli forces have [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  wrought but it's Hamas that needs the break and the longer they can make that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=179.08s)]
*  break the better off they'll be. I don't think people should forget that at the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  beginning of this war the Biden administration sent military advisors to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=189.0s)]
*  Israel that said look learn from our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=192.84s)]
*  Don't rush in, tell mail, take your time, this is very complicated. Using the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=197.76s)]
*  examples particularly of Fallujah and Mosul in Iraq which took nine to twelve [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=203.08s)]
*  months for American and Iraqi forces to secure. We're seven weeks into this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=208.64s)]
*  There's a long way to go but if Israel's resolve can be weakened and broken [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=213.52s)]
*  they'll never get to the amount of time they really need to accomplish the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  stated objective of eliminating Hamas. That is I mean quite an objective. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  They're not just saying they want to demean or diminish Hamas. They have used [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=229.96s)]
*  words like eliminate and eradicate Hamas. We heard from the defense minister [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=233.52s)]
*  earlier saying that after this pause he believes it will take two more months of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  fighting. Do you realistically think that Israel can achieve that goal within [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=242.08s)]
*  two months? Well you know I read that comment as well. I understood that to be [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=246.4s)]
*  saying to the Israeli forces we've got two months of intense struggle ahead of [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=253.08s)]
*  us. I didn't see it as limiting it to two months but part of the psychological [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  campaign, part of the propaganda effort here is to undercut Israel's ability to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=262.68s)]
*  get to that stated objective. For example the Russian Prime Minister [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=268.76s)]
*  Medvedev said a couple of weeks ago that Israel as an occupying power, which it's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=272.52s)]
*  not by the way in the Gaza Strip, but as an occupying power did not have a [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=279.56s)]
*  legitimate right of self-defense meaning implicitly that everything Israel has [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=283.88s)]
*  done since October the 7th has been illegitimate since it doesn't have the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=288.84s)]
*  right to self-defense. A senior UN quote-unquote human rights official said [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=293.12s)]
*  the same thing about a week ago. That's going to be part of the argument here to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=299.0s)]
*  say you've gone far enough you don't have to eliminate it just sit down and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=303.24s)]
*  negotiate with them. You can see it coming and what I worry about is the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=307.12s)]
*  pause if it begins in a few hours is just the opening wedge to achieve that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=311.24s)]
*  objective. So you think that once Israel has agreed to this this pause once [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=315.68s)]
*  it starts just literally in a matter of hours from now that basically the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=322.32s)]
*  international criticism of Israel restarting its military campaign will be [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  so high that they may not actually do it? Well I think I think the Israelis are [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=330.91999999999996s)]
*  pretty immune to a lot of blabbering internationally. What I worry about is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  that the White House is losing its resolve. There's no secret if you if you [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=342.11999999999995s)]
*  read in American papers you can see many of the the pro-Palestinian elements of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=346.64s)]
*  the Democratic Party are saying they want the pause to be transformed into a [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  truce or into a ceasefire. A lot of these words become interchangeable after a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=356.68s)]
*  while and that's the objective and I think Biden recognizes he's got a severe [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=361.56s)]
*  problem because of the schism within the Democratic Party. So domestic US politics [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=365.96s)]
*  are going to play a role here and if the mood can be shifted talking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=370.96s)]
*  about the anguish of the hostages nobody nobody really talks about the 190 [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=375.72s)]
*  hostages who are not going to be released in the next four days. You know [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=380.16s)]
*  this can have a significant impact. I think really the questioning that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  Medvedev has started off of the legitimacy of what Israel is doing is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=389.08s)]
*  just going to be amplified. What the Israelis need to do and frankly what [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=393.56s)]
*  the United States needs to do is reinforce the legitimacy of self-defense [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=397.16s)]
*  permitting Israel in this situation not to minimize the threat but to eliminate [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=403.16s)]
*  the threat and the threat really is not just to us. Ultimately think of Hezbollah [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=408.64000000000004s)]
*  in the north for almost the entire seven weeks since October the 7th they've been [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=413.16s)]
*  shelling targets in northern Israel. All of this under the watchful eyes of the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=418.8s)]
*  mullahs in Tehran. This is a much bigger conflict than just in the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=424.0s)]
*  Yeah and Hezbollah is not party to this temporary truce. Of course Ambassador [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  John Bolton is always thank you for your time. Thanks for joining us tonight on [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=436.08s)]
*  Thanksgiving. Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCtoGV4SmU&t=439.04s)]
