# ‘Huge concern’: Military analyst on new fears of wider war in Middle East
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0)
*  New strikes on Iranian-backed militants far from Israel's borders stoking fears that the United States is on the brink of a wider war in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. hitting multiple pro-Iranian targets in the region. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=10.0s)]
*  In northern Iraq, a U.S. drone strike killed at least five militants. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=14.0s)]
*  U.S. officials saying that it was a preemptive strike to stop an imminent attack. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=18.0s)]
*  And then when you look here, this is the Red Sea right here, the U.S. shot down three drones launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militants and responded to four separate missile attacks against commercial ships. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=22.0s)]
*  Iran-backed proxy groups actually have now launched 76 attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17th. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=35.0s)]
*  76 attacks. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=46.0s)]
*  Let's discuss this now. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=48.0s)]
*  CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Layton. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=49.0s)]
*  All right, so, Colonel, and I'm going to go back here to the region so that we can see the 76 attacks. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=53.0s)]
*  That is an awful lot. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=57.0s)]
*  And this tit-for-tat really seems to be escalating despite multiple warnings from the U.S. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=58.0s)]
*  How concerned are you for the potential here of a miscalculation getting into a broader conflict? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=62.0s)]
*  Well, Brianna, it's a huge concern because where these attacks have occurred, you look at the Kirkuk area, you look at the Al-Assad area, which is really over here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=69.0s)]
*  All of these types of attacks really are challenging U.S. security postures. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=77.0s)]
*  Plus, you look at everything that has happened in the Red Sea. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=83.0s)]
*  You have all these different places. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=86.0s)]
*  Plus, of course, what happened in Syria. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=88.0s)]
*  So every single one of these attacks is a signal from Iran and its proxies that they are not only watching what the U.S. is doing, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=90.0s)]
*  but it's also a signal that they are prepared to act against the U.S. should they feel the need to do so. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=97.0s)]
*  The U.S. has, of course, surged its assets, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=104.0s)]
*  It's got two carrier strike groups in the region. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=107.0s)]
*  That doesn't, though, seem to have worked fully as a deterrent. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=110.0s)]
*  We still see what they're doing here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=114.0s)]
*  What can the U.S. do to get them to knock it off? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=116.0s)]
*  So one of the key things is where they deploy these carrier strike groups. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=119.0s)]
*  So one of them is right here in the eastern Mediterranean. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=123.0s)]
*  The other one is right about here at the entrance to the Persian Gulf and maybe a little bit beyond that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=126.0s)]
*  So that's one thing is the proximity of these groups. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=132.0s)]
*  Plus, they also have aircraft in places like Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait, and even in Jordan. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=135.0s)]
*  So these aircraft can be used to move forward. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=142.0s)]
*  They can also pre-position troops in other areas. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=146.0s)]
*  So there are several options that the U.S. has. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=148.0s)]
*  Plus, they can use any of these strike forces to actually engage these forces, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=150.0s)]
*  the Iranian proxies and even Iranian forces themselves, should the president direct that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=156.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the objective here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=161.0s)]
*  Why are these Houthi rebels, I mean, yes, they're attacking the USS Carney, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=163.0s)]
*  but attacking three commercial ships, what is the goal here? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=170.0s)]
*  So actually, when it comes to the USS Carney, it's kind of unclear as to whether or not they actually attacked the Carney. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=174.0s)]
*  But the Carney responded to protect these ships. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=180.0s)]
*  But what they are trying to do is they're trying to limit commerce throughout the Red Sea. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=182.0s)]
*  About 12% of all global commerce goes through this area right here, which is the Suez Canal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=187.0s)]
*  And the Red Sea is the line through which all these ships pass. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=192.0s)]
*  So 12% of global commerce, a lot of it is controlled by European interests. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=196.0s)]
*  Some of it is controlled also by Israeli interests. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=201.0s)]
*  So every time that they think there is an Israeli-related ship going through here, they want to interdict that ship. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=203.0s)]
*  They want to stop it from moving. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=208.0s)]
*  And when they do that, they think that they're hurting Israel's economy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=210.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=213.0s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about the ground war that the IDF is waging against Hamas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=214.0s)]
*  Now there is this movement towards southern Gaza. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=219.0s)]
*  And actually, as we look, the IDF has dropped leaflets. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=224.0s)]
*  You have IDF tanks that were geolocated in the Khan-Yunis area. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=228.0s)]
*  Tell us about some of the issues this is going to raise when it comes to mobilizing people and keeping people safe. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=232.0s)]
*  Yes. This is a really interesting thing because at the beginning of the conflict, after the 7th of October, everything was basically centered. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=239.0s)]
*  All the Israeli attacks were basically centered in north Gaza and in the north central part of Gaza, which is really where Gaza City is. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=246.0s)]
*  So all of this, basically about 50% of all buildings have been completely destroyed in this area, probably more than that actually by now. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=254.0s)]
*  So now what's happening is the Israelis are moving south along the routes right through here. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=261.0s)]
*  Before this happened, before they moved south, they told all the civilians in this area to move down south as well. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=267.0s)]
*  But along with the civilians, Hamas fighters have also been interspersed within these areas. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=274.0s)]
*  At least that's what the IDF thinks. And it's pretty likely that that is in fact the case. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=279.0s)]
*  And now we have the Israeli forces moving down here. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=284.0s)]
*  Coupled with air power, what they are trying to do is they're trying to go into all of these areas [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=287.0s)]
*  and eliminate as many of the Hamas fighters as possible, but that's also going to impact the civilians. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=292.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very scary situation for them. They feel they have nowhere to go where they can be safe. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=299.0s)]
*  Colonel, great to have you take us through this. Thank you so much. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNULLdleZm0&t=305.0s)]
