# He quit the State Department over US support for Israel. Here's why he did it
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I)
*  What influence does the United States have as Israel seeks to avenge the slaughter of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=0.0s)]
*  1,200 people on October 7th and to remove Hamas from power in Gaza? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=5.12s)]
*  Our first guest tonight, Josh Paul, resigned from the State Department soon after October [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=11.18s)]
*  7th in protest of what he said were unscrutinized U.S. arms transfers to Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=15.36s)]
*  In his resignation letter, he said the Israeli response and American support, quote, will [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=21.04s)]
*  only lead to more and deeper suffering for both the Israeli and Palestinian people and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=26.48s)]
*  is not in the long-term American interest. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=32.36s)]
*  And Josh Paul is joining me now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=35.66s)]
*  Welcome to the program. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=36.96s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed for having me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=37.96s)]
*  So I was struck by what the U.S. defense secretary said. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=39.68s)]
*  I mean, this is a very bold military assessment that this amount of civilian killing is going [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=44.2s)]
*  to lead not only to this tragedy that the world is witnessing, but a strategic, he used [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=52.24s)]
*  the word defeat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=57.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=58.92s)]
*  And so tell me, how do you assess what he said? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=59.92s)]
*  I think he's right. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=63.88s)]
*  And I think what you see is a tension between those of us who have worked in political and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  military fields, on the ground in the Middle East and in the defense establishment in the [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  uniformed services, who understand that this is not going to work. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=75.2s)]
*  This is not going to lead to the result that Israel wants. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=78.88s)]
*  It is just going to prolong the suffering of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=80.96s)]
*  for another generation, as opposed to, I think, a very political ideological perspective that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  is coming from the political level in the U.S. and in Israel and in the U.K. that thinks [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  that there is a way to make this work. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=98.0s)]
*  There is not. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=99.64s)]
*  And the suffering we are seeing on the ground really reflects that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=100.64s)]
*  I can't recall a time in my experience where I've seen such a disconnect between our values [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=103.08s)]
*  and our actions or between the perspectives of our political leadership and the realities [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=108.72s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=113.52s)]
*  Can I ask you where and how you draw that line and make that difference? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=114.52s)]
*  This is not the first time Israel has gone to war against Hamas in Gaza, and it's not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=119.36s)]
*  the first time there has been backlash around the world. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=123.8s)]
*  What makes you say that this is so different to have caused you to have resigned? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=128.56s)]
*  So a number of factors, the first of which is just the scope and the scale. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=134.04s)]
*  Here we are two months into this conflict, and we have seen three times more children [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=138.36s)]
*  die, 6,000 in Gaza, than in two years of Russia's war against Ukraine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=143.16000000000003s)]
*  We have seen over 50 journalists killed, over 100 U.N. aid workers, over 200 medical professionals. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=148.24s)]
*  Do you know what it takes to be a doctor in Gaza? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=155.68s)]
*  So the scale... [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  We've interviewed a lot of them, and it's a terrible situation for them. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  The scale of the loss has been astounding. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=161.52s)]
*  And of course, my role in the State Department involves approving many of these major arms [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=163.76000000000002s)]
*  transfers that are going to Israel right now that are enabling this killing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=167.76s)]
*  But this is American policy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=172.28s)]
*  It's not like these are rogue transfers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=174.4s)]
*  This is American policy, bipartisan, decades long. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=176.56s)]
*  Israel is America's strongest ally in the Middle East, and America provides the most [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=180.6s)]
*  aid in the world to Israel and obviously to Egypt as well, but in general to Israel. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=185.84s)]
*  Again, what is so unscrutinized about this? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=191.76s)]
*  What was so different that made you resign publicly? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, in all the arms transfers I've been a part of discussing before, including to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  Israel, there has always been space for discussion and debate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  You can raise concerns about how are these arms going to be used? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  Do we have confidence that laws of war, laws of proportionality are going to be respected? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=209.16s)]
*  Do we have concerns about some of the units that these arms might be going to and their [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=214.16s)]
*  track records? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  What was different here was that there was no discussion. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  There was no space for that discussion. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=222.28s)]
*  There was simply an approach of essentially the barn doors are open, and that remains [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  the case. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=227.72s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reported just in the last couple of days that America has transferred [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=229.2s)]
*  over 4,000 dumb bombs to Israel, several thousand guidance kits, and 45,000 artillery shells. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=232.88s)]
*  So the barn doors remain open, and while I'm certainly encouraged to hear what Vice President [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=242.0s)]
*  Harris said, what Secretary Austin has said, for as long as those barn doors remain open, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=247.44s)]
*  I don't know why Israel would take those warnings seriously. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=252.32s)]
*  Can I just read the State Department response to your resignation, basically saying that [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=255.64s)]
*  it expects and appreciates employees have different beliefs? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=260.12s)]
*  And of course, one thing that is actually kind of interesting for all of us is to know [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=262.52s)]
*  that there is a dissent, there's an official dissent channel in the State Department that [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=266.44s)]
*  allows people to air their concerns, and that is history from the Vietnam War. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=270.32s)]
*  This is what the State Department says about you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=277.48s)]
*  With respect to this specific criticism that's been aired, we have made very clear that we [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=279.08s)]
*  strongly support Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=283.44s)]
*  We're going to continue providing the security assistance that they need to defend themselves, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=286.52s)]
*  but the President and the Secretary of State has spoken to this very clearly, that we expect [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel to abide by all international law as they defend themselves. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=296.68s)]
*  Israel says it's doing that to the best of its ability. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=301.0s)]
*  So I think we have a responsibility as the larger, more powerful partner in this relationship [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=303.46s)]
*  to give advice, to give guidance, to step in when things are not going right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=309.03999999999996s)]
*  And when we say that we have a responsibility to or a commitment to defend Israel and to [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=313.56s)]
*  support Israel's security, I think we have to look at the situation on the ground and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  say, is that what is actually happening? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=322.64s)]
*  Is Israel more secure as a result of our assistance, or has our military assistance enabled Israel [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  to move ahead with the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, to continue the siege of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=331.0s)]
*  Gaza and to take steps that ultimately undermine its own security rather than leading to a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=335.36s)]
*  comprehensive peace? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=340.52000000000004s)]
*  As you know, the U.S. administration believes, and whether it says it publicly or behind [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=342.32s)]
*  closed doors, that the only way to get, for instance, it's not a secret that there's no [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  love lost between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu before this, over the attempted, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  essentially, these are my words, overthrow of a democratic system in their so-called [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=359.0s)]
*  judicial reform. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=362.68s)]
*  When President Biden didn't even invite him to the White House, it's a total rarity. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=363.68s)]
*  However, they believe that in order to affect Israeli policy, the likes of which you're [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=367.56s)]
*  talking now, to affect the policy and make it more towards the peace process, they have [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=373.48s)]
*  to embrace Israel, defend Israel, support Israel in order to get the trust of the Israeli [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=379.48s)]
*  people so that they can then speak, you know, speak clearly to the Israeli governments. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=387.12s)]
*  And you saw what happened under the Obama administration. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=392.68s)]
*  The people of Israel didn't support the Obama administration. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=395.88s)]
*  They thought Obama didn't support them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=398.32s)]
*  So first of all, I would ask where that embrace gets the United States. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=401.08s)]
*  If you look at what is unfolding now, it is not only a disaster in Gaza, but it is a foreign [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  policy disaster for the United States, across the Arab world, and frankly, across the global [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=409.48s)]
*  South. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=414.16s)]
*  We seem like hypocrites when we criticize Israel, rather when we criticize Russia for [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=415.44s)]
*  human rights abuses, but fail to do so with Israel. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=420.6s)]
*  And so I think that our embrace, we have to be careful with that embrace because it draws [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=423.76s)]
*  us in as well. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=428.8s)]
*  Secondly, of course, the answer is we do have leverage that we can use within that embrace. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that America should not remain close with Israel. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm suggesting simply that as we are the provider of arms, as we are the provider of billions [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=439.0s)]
*  of dollars in taxpayer-funded assistance every year to what is actually a wealthy country, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=444.46000000000004s)]
*  we do have a fair amount of leverage. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=449.68s)]
*  And of course, we provide Israel with security and diplomatic backup across the region that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=451.56s)]
*  has enabled its integration. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=456.56s)]
*  We have a lot of leverage here to set Israel on a better path and to end this senseless [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=458.88s)]
*  killing in Gaza. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=463.6s)]
*  We are not using it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  How does what happened on October 7th in Israel was barbaric. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=467.74s)]
*  It was savage. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=473.04s)]
*  We've heard the stories of rape and gang rape, of children being shot to death in front of [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=474.44s)]
*  their parents. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=479.76s)]
*  We know what's happened with more than 250 people who've been taken hostage, including [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=480.76s)]
*  babies. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=485.48s)]
*  How does a nation get... [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=488.36s)]
*  I don't even know what the right word is. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=492.08s)]
*  Beyond it, I don't know what the right word is. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=493.72s)]
*  How does it get to feel that it's being supported and that it then doesn't, you know, have to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  do what's going on in Gaza right now? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=504.08s)]
*  The elders, which is a group of former presidents, prime ministers and UN officials, have also [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=505.71999999999997s)]
*  questioned now, they've just put out a statement questioning arms transfers and talking about [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=511.44s)]
*  the inhumanity that's happening in Gaza that's rising to an intolerable level. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=517.4s)]
*  I think what happened on October 7th was an absolute atrocity, was a thousand atrocities. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=523.06s)]
*  I think at the same time we condemn those atrocities, we have to condemn the atrocities [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=527.76s)]
*  that happen every day to Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=531.56s)]
*  You mentioned sexual violence. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=534.72s)]
*  I was part of the human rights vetting process for arms going to Israel and a charity called [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=536.48s)]
*  Defense of Children International Palestine drew our attention at the State Department [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=541.6s)]
*  to the sexual assault, actually the rape, of a 13-year-old boy that occurred in an Israeli [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=545.96s)]
*  prison in Moskabia in Jerusalem. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  We examined these allegations, we believed they were credible, we put them to the government [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=553.06s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=558.28s)]
*  And you know what happened the next day? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=559.6800000000001s)]
*  The IDF went into the DCIP offices and removed all their computers and declared them a terrorist entity. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=561.8000000000001s)]
*  I think it is vital that atrocities not happen to anyone, not sexual violations, not any [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=569.32s)]
*  kind of gross violation of human rights. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=575.28s)]
*  We are looking at a situation where there is so much dehumanification, where people [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=577.36s)]
*  are not seen for the value that they have. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=581.6s)]
*  And I think that's true whether you're talking about those who are attacked on their kibbutz [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=584.26s)]
*  or those who are attacked in their homes in Gaza or in the West Bank. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=587.92s)]
*  What we really need is to center the human beings who are at the core and who are suffering [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=591.28s)]
*  so much in this conflict. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=596.4399999999999s)]
*  Do you believe that in order to have some kind of peaceful resolution, so this never [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=599.16s)]
*  happens again, that Hamas has to be removed from power? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=603.68s)]
*  How do you neutralize Hamas? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=611.24s)]
*  The answer is through a lasting political settlement that provides a Palestinian state, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=612.68s)]
*  not a process that promises one, holds out the promise and never gets to it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=617.92s)]
*  You neutralize Hamas by showing the Palestinian people that if they want to succeed, the route [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=622.56s)]
*  is there for them to do so through a political process rather than through violent resistance. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=628.92s)]
*  Until we have that political process in place, you cannot defeat the Palestinian resistance. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5106v4b05I&t=634.28s)]
