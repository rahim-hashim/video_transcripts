# Israel targets Hezbollah chief in Beirut strike
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo)
*  I want to go to our Jeremy Diamond, who's standing by in Jaffa in Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=0.0s)]
*  our CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=3.52s)]
*  and our global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=5.84s)]
*  Jeremy, let me go to you first, because we do have the statement form, the IDF, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=8.96s)]
*  basically saying they are responsible, they carried out what they called a targeted strike. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=14.0s)]
*  They were attacking, I think, a number... [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=20.64s)]
*  Well, pardon me, targeted strike in Beirut on a commander. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Commander responsible for the murder of the children in Mashd al-Sams. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=30.24s)]
*  But it says at the moment there are no changes in the Home Front command defensive guidelines. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=33.52s)]
*  What does that mean, Jeremy? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=38.32s)]
*  Well, effectively, the Home Front guidelines are the guidelines issued to civilians in Israel [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=42.56s)]
*  to tell them effectively what the risk level is at this moment in terms of military action. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  It's to tell them whether to cancel large gatherings, to not go to school, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=53.04s)]
*  to be within reach of a bomb shelter at all times. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=58.0s)]
*  And in this case, the Israeli military has decided not to make any changes to those guidelines, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=61.52s)]
*  which indicates, at least for the moment, that they don't anticipate that this will [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  immediately escalate any further than it already has. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=70.16s)]
*  But make no mistake, that possibility is certainly in the air tonight, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=73.2s)]
*  as we have seen this very significant Israeli strike hit the southern suburbs of the Lebanese [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=77.36s)]
*  capital, Dahyeh, which is notable in and of itself for the location given its proximity to Beirut. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=83.52s)]
*  But also in addition to that, it is the fact that they are targeting a senior commander in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=90.96s)]
*  that area. They say that this commander, who they have not named in this statement, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=95.28s)]
*  was responsible for this rocket attack that killed 12 children in the Israel-controlled [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=99.52s)]
*  Golan Heights in the Syrian Druze community of Mashd al-Sams. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=106.88s)]
*  It has been clear since this weekend when that rocket attack took place, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=111.12s)]
*  when we saw the number of civilians killed, the fact that these were all children who were killed [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  as well, it became immediately clear that there was a possibility of escalation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=119.76s)]
*  And since then, we have heard clear statements from Israeli officials vowing that there would [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=125.04s)]
*  be a severe response, vowing that Hezbollah would have a price to pay, even as Hezbollah, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=130.08s)]
*  of course, denied responsibility for this attack. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=135.44s)]
*  And so now we have finally seen what shape that response has taken as the Israeli military [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=138.4s)]
*  in just the last couple of hours carried out this strike and then very quickly confirmed it, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=144.0s)]
*  making clear that they wanted to send a message that, as the Israeli defense minister says tonight, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  a red line was crossed by Hezbollah in this rocket attack over the weekend [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=154.24s)]
*  and an Israeli response was merited. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=158.4s)]
*  Thanks very much, Jeremy Diamond. Let's get to Cedric Leighton, who is with us. And Cedric, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=160.88s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that many were expecting a response, all expecting some sort of retaliation [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=165.36s)]
*  for the Golan Heights attack. What do you make of what we are learning this sound, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=171.52s)]
*  the idea of saying it was a targeted strike? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=175.52s)]
*  Now, you say, I think that is really the key thing here. And if it turns out to be true [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  that this was a drone strike instead of a strike with a manned aircraft, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  that also goes to show that the Israelis were looking for a very precise action. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  They wanted to do this with a minimum of collateral damage. And that, I think, commensurate with some [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=196.8s)]
*  of the pressure that the Israelis have probably received from the U.S. as well as other Western [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  nations to minimize civilian casualties in any type of response that they would make. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  I think everybody expected them to make this kind of an effort, this kind of a response, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=215.36s)]
*  in response to what happened at Marshall Trump's. But the other thing that they had to consider [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=220.4s)]
*  was the fact that they needed to also minimize the possibility of civilian casualties. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=226.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, this is a very dangerous moment, right? This is not a war zone. This is happening [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=231.76s)]
*  as we showed off your streets of Beirut. And that is absolutely terrifying. We've heard in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  the last few minutes from the Lebanese state media that the strike was conducted by drone that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  fired three missiles. If we play the video that we played at the top of the show, I'm just going [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=246.4s)]
*  to ask my producers to play that out. From what we see in this video, once we play it out, Cedric, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=250.24s)]
*  I wonder whether you could tell us in terms of the impact. We're hearing one casualty here. What more [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=255.04000000000002s)]
*  can you dissect from the video that we have seen so far? The images. Here we go. It's playing right [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=260.8s)]
*  now. Right. So when you look at the destruction in the street, this is commensurate with a fairly [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=265.52s)]
*  low powered explosive, something that on the order of perhaps a 250 pound bomb or less, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=274.16s)]
*  and I say or less with emphasis in that case because there would be far greater destruction [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=281.44s)]
*  to the buildings if a standard bomb would have been used in this particular case, Isa. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=286.88000000000005s)]
*  And so you see some of the, obviously there's building debris in the middle of the street there. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=294.56s)]
*  Some windows appear to have blown out. And there does seem to be a case where they looked at a very [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  specific location within a building to go after a very specific individual target. So that's what [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=309.6s)]
*  it looks like to me at the present time. And I see these are live pictures right now. And it does [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=316.56s)]
*  seem as if they're basically in a mopping up operation, but they don't expect any secondary [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=322.24s)]
*  or tertiary attacks after this one. At least that's what it looks like right now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=327.84s)]
*  So do stay with us. Let me go to our Matthew Charles. And Matthew, we look, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=333.28s)]
*  we are in unknown territory. Yes, Israel's claim responsibility, as we heard from our Jeremy [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=337.44s)]
*  Diamond there. But as Bala had said previously, Matthew, they would meet escalation with escalation, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=343.28s)]
*  right? Speak to the significance of this moment and the fear, of course, that this could widen out [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=347.76s)]
*  the wider conflict. Yeah, I think the question here is, is this the start of a broader Israeli [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=352.72s)]
*  campaign in southern Lebanon? Or will it provoke a broader campaign in southern Lebanon? Or is it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=362.0s)]
*  just a very limited action that was undertaken in response to those dreadful killings in Majdal [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=368.8s)]
*  Shams in the Golan Heights at the weekend in which those 12 children, teenagers as well, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=376.4s)]
*  were killed? And the whole region is on a knife edge trying to grapple with that question. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=384.0s)]
*  I can certainly tell you, and I've been up to northern Israel several times since the October [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=391.12s)]
*  7th attacks, there's a great deal of political pressure inside Israel and in northern Israel, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=396.56s)]
*  particularly, to strike at Hezbollah, to push that group back from the northern border of Israel. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=403.52s)]
*  Northern Israel is under constant, not just a constant threat of missile attack, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=410.4s)]
*  but actually under constant missile attack as well. And it's led to whole communities being [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=414.64s)]
*  evacuated. They're not able to go back into their homes. They're fright, fearful that what happened [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=420.32s)]
*  from Gaza in southern Israel could happen to them in northern Israel as well. So there's enormous [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=428.0s)]
*  amount of political pressure the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is feeling to strike at [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=434.16s)]
*  Hezbollah. But that has to be balanced with the fact that Israel is exhausted. It is already [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=439.6s)]
*  engaged in a bitter conflict in the south of the country, inside Gaza, and just doesn't have the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=447.04s)]
*  energy potentially. It may have the means, but it doesn't necessarily have the energy and the [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=453.04s)]
*  political will to go full on into Lebanon right now. Now, whether it escalates into something [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=456.88s)]
*  else, it has a momentum of its own, we will see. But that is the issue we're confronted with tonight. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. The concern is how does Hezbollah retaliate if it indeed does retaliate to this, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=467.84000000000003s)]
*  as we have seen tit for tat before. Let me go to our Ben Wiedemann, who is in Beirut for us. Ben, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=474.72s)]
*  just give us a sense of what you are learning. We're looking at these images out of Beirut. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=481.2s)]
*  Streets, a patch is here, an ambulance. We've seen some of the first scenes. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=485.52s)]
*  What are you learning from authorities there and importantly about casualties at this stage? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=489.12s)]
*  Well, this strike happened just before eight o'clock in the evening local time. This is a time [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=497.2s)]
*  when the streets are crowded with people and the neighborhood where it happened, Harat Hareik in [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=503.12s)]
*  southern part of Beirut, is a very crowded, populous neighborhood. Now, that is where [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  many of Hezbollah's leaders operate out of, but that's also where hundreds of thousands of civilians [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=514.96s)]
*  live as well. Now, we're hearing from the national news agency, the official Lebanese news agency, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=522.48s)]
*  that at least one woman was killed and several others injured. There are reports in the local [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  media that hospitals in the area are calling for donations of blood as well. Also, I'm hearing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=534.0s)]
*  that people are lining up, queuing up at petrol stations to fill because this is an event that, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=542.96s)]
*  although it comes at a surprise in terms of the time and the place, the fact that it happened was [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=549.84s)]
*  no surprise at all because it was widely expected that there would be some sort of Israeli response [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=554.4s)]
*  to the attack on Mezhd el-Shamz in the Israeli occupied Syria in Golan Heights that left 12 [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=560.56s)]
*  people dead. But the other day I was speaking with the foreign minister of Lebanon who told me that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=566.56s)]
*  they, the Lebanese government had received assurances through diplomatic channels that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=574.16s)]
*  Beirut, the Beirut airport, and specifically the southern suburbs of Beirut would not be struck. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=581.1199999999999s)]
*  That was their interpretation of those assurances. So, clearly, those assurances [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=587.76s)]
*  don't amount to much at this point. Now, we know that the secretary general of Hezbollah [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=593.84s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah has said time and time again that striking Beirut is crossing a red line. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=600.24s)]
*  However, on the 2nd of January of this year, Israel did launch a strike that killed a senior [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=607.12s)]
*  Hamas leader, also roughly in that area as well. So, we'll have to simply wait and see how Hezbollah [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=612.88s)]
*  is going to respond. But I know that organization well. They are not going to go quietly into the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=621.04s)]
*  night. There will be some sort of response from Hezbollah. They have said they will meet escalation [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=627.28s)]
*  with escalation. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-HUwFLX6bo&t=634.24s)]
