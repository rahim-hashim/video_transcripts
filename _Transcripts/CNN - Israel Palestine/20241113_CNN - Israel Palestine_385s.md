# Mike Huckabee once said that ‘there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian’
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM)
*  President-elect Trump choosing Mike Huckabee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=0.0s)]
*  for the job of U.S. Ambassador to Israel. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=1.8s)]
*  Now this is a decision that would have huge ramifications. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=4.14s)]
*  And we have a very different view on policy [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  what Huckabee's put forward than any other ambassadors [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=9.5s)]
*  who publicly who have served in that role. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=12.84s)]
*  K-File tonight is revealing that Huckabee said, quote, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=14.58s)]
*  there's really no such thing as a Palestinian. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=16.92s)]
*  Nevermind a state. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=20.14s)]
*  Huckabee making extensive comments on this topic [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=21.36s)]
*  when he was running for president in 2008. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=23.48s)]
*  And Andrew Kaczynski of K-File joins me now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=25.32s)]
*  In the context of the war and the fears [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=28.74s)]
*  that it could become a much, much bigger war, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=31.58s)]
*  this reporting is so crucial. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=34.12s)]
*  What more do you know about what Mike Huckabee has said? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=35.36s)]
*  Right, and this nomination of Mike Huckabee [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  as ambassador to Israel, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=39.26s)]
*  this is a extremely hawkish pick by President-elect Trump. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=40.32s)]
*  He has a track record of highly polarizing comments [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=44.16s)]
*  on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=48.0s)]
*  These views go back years with him [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=49.84s)]
*  repeatedly questioning the legitimacy of a Palestinian state [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=52.44s)]
*  on the border with Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  He has said that if a Palestinian state were to be created, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=57.660000000000004s)]
*  it should be not created where it is now, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=60.96s)]
*  it should be created with land from the neighboring countries, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=62.94s)]
*  Syria, Jordan, Egypt. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=65.74s)]
*  He even described a Palestinian identity [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=67.68s)]
*  in one of the clips he found as, quote, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=70.14s)]
*  a political tool to try and force land away from Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=71.94s)]
*  And I first obtained these comments we're about to hear [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=77.82s)]
*  when he ran for president in 2016. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=79.82s)]
*  Just take a listen to them right now. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=82.66s)]
*  Basically, there really is no such thing as, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=85.02s)]
*  I have to be careful in saying this, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=87.58s)]
*  because people really get up, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=89.17999999999999s)]
*  there's really no such thing as a Palestinian. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=90.61999999999999s)]
*  There's no, there's no, there's no. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=93.41999999999999s)]
*  There's no, there's no. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  There's no such complexity to the name. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=96.05999999999999s)]
*  There's really no such thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  That's been a political tool to try to force land away [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=101.06s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, just obviously hugely significant. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=107.5s)]
*  You're talking about he would, if anything, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=109.38s)]
*  take land from neighboring countries. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=110.88s)]
*  Obviously, the clear implications there would be [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=112.86s)]
*  for Israel to annex the West Bank, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=114.4s)]
*  which is obviously seismic, if true. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=116.64s)]
*  Andrew, obviously, this isn't the only time [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=121.14s)]
*  Huckabee has talked about this issue. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=123.14s)]
*  I mean, this is an issue that he feels is deeply personal. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=124.74000000000001s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=128.62s)]
*  He takes trips to Israel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=129.62s)]
*  This goes back all the way, I mean, to 2008, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=130.58s)]
*  where we played that initial clip from. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=133.62s)]
*  But this is a position that he has consistently had. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=135.66s)]
*  It is far from the only time that he has said it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=138.42000000000002s)]
*  He has said consistently that he opposes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=141.28s)]
*  a two-state solution. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=143.72s)]
*  He has said, quote, there's plenty of land outside Israel [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  and the rest of the world for a Palestinian state. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=149.06s)]
*  Take a listen to him going a little bit further [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=152.1s)]
*  on that in 2015. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=154.2s)]
*  The two-state solution, if we mean two governments [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  holding the same piece of real estate, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=160.04s)]
*  is irrational and unworkable. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  If there is a two-state solution, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=164.44s)]
*  the Palestinian state needs to be outside the bounds [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  outside the boundaries of the nation of Israel. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=170.4s)]
*  There's plenty of land in the world [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=173.88s)]
*  that we could find a place and say, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=175.32s)]
*  okay, let's create a Palestinian state. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=176.73999999999998s)]
*  So we did reach out to Huckabee personally, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=181.48s)]
*  we reached out to the transition, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=183.92s)]
*  and we asked them if he stood by those comments. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=186.32s)]
*  We didn't hear back from either of them, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=188.28s)]
*  so it's gonna be interesting to see how all of this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=189.6s)]
*  plays out, especially with the conflict [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=191.79999999999998s)]
*  that's going on right now in Gaza. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  Oh, certainly, and raises questions of the voters [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=195.44s)]
*  and the voters who had voted for Jill Stein [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=198.88000000000002s)]
*  as an opposition to Kamala Harris, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  so they may feel about what this policy looks like. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=202.22s)]
*  And some of them even voted for Trump as well. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=203.96s)]
*  And some of them even voted for Trump, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=205.42000000000002s)]
*  and this is, well, this is what you would have thought, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=206.56s)]
*  Trump, this is consistent with the words [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  that they've put out before. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=211.36s)]
*  And Andrew, thank you very much. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  There are certain words I refuse to use. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  There is no such thing as a West Bank, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=216.60000000000002s)]
*  it's Judea and Samaria. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=218.08s)]
*  There's no such thing as a settlement, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  they're communities, they're neighborhoods, they're cities. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=220.94s)]
*  There's no such thing as an occupation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=223.84s)]
*  All right, our panel is back. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=226.88s)]
*  Stephen Collinson, Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu's Israel, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=229.72s)]
*  likely to welcome this pick. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=233.04s)]
*  It's worth noting Huckabee is the first in quite some time [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=234.72s)]
*  to not be Jewish in this role, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=237.48s)]
*  but of course evangelical Christians, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=239.76s)]
*  and that's really kind of Huckabee's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=241.48s)]
*  defining political identity, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=243.04s)]
*  have a very specific relationship with the Jewish state, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=245.44s)]
*  and you heard him articulate some of it here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=250.56s)]
*  What does it mean? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=252.32s)]
*  This is a clear sign that the administration's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=253.72s)]
*  first term policy, which was very soliditous [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=256.24s)]
*  towards the Netanyahu coalition, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=259.52s)]
*  will continue and will go even further. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=263.04s)]
*  It will be regarded as a disaster by Palestinians [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=265.68s)]
*  who still are a long way from that two state solution, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=270.0s)]
*  which now seems almost likely never to happen [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=274.68s)]
*  given the events of the last year or so. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  I think it poses two real questions, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=281.56s)]
*  notwithstanding the fact that the ambassador [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=284.16s)]
*  doesn't make the policy the president does. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=285.88s)]
*  How will this be seen by some of Trump's allies [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=288.64s)]
*  in the Arab world with whom he wants to create [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=292.8s)]
*  this realignment of the Middle East between Israel, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=297.36s)]
*  some of the Gulf states, and Iran? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=300.6s)]
*  That could be a problem if this is the Trump policy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=302.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Brad, how do you see that piece of this? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=308.2s)]
*  Well, I think if you look back at the first [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=310.36s)]
*  Trump administration, the signature foreign policy [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  success happened in Israel. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=314.6s)]
*  Democrats lost their mind when Donald Trump [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=316.8s)]
*  moved the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  even though many of them had voted for it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=320.8s)]
*  And then when he recognized the Golan Heights, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=322.8s)]
*  they said, this is terrible, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=324.52000000000004s)]
*  it's gonna cause disruptions. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=325.36s)]
*  It didn't. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  Instead, what happened is as soon as the United States [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=327.36s)]
*  was fully behind Israel without question, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  we got the Abraham Accords, and a lot of Arab nations [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=331.64s)]
*  making peace with Israel for the first time. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=333.56s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump has figured out the code on this. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=335.76s)]
*  The United States has to stand with Israel [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  and make it completely clear it stands with Israel, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=340.72s)]
*  and then things will begin to take place [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=343.24s)]
*  and work out in the Middle East. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=344.72s)]
*  I think it's a good pick. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=345.92s)]
*  My company spent a ton of time in Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=347.32s)]
*  He has a lot of relationships there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=348.92s)]
*  I think it's a good pick. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=350.72s)]
*  Just one thing I wanted to add is, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=352.44s)]
*  Trump is doing exactly what he said he was gonna do, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=353.68s)]
*  which is that he wanted Netanyahu to escalate the conflict, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=355.6s)]
*  not de-escalate the conflict. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=359.32s)]
*  And there's gonna be a lot of potentially [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=360.8s)]
*  civilian casualties if that happens. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=363.32s)]
*  And if you see that happen, you're going to see this [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=365.88s)]
*  become even more of a fight on the left part [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=368.20000000000005s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  I think that's true, but I also think it will be, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=371.76000000000005s)]
*  if the violence continues to unravel [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  in the way that we've seen, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  and he's not able to actually stop the violence, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=377.72s)]
*  that's gonna be a stain on his administration early on, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=381.16s)]
*  depending upon how this plays out. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4chxcXBDXM&t=384.08000000000004s)]
