# What the death of Yahya Sinwar means for Israel, Gaza, and the Middle East, according to experts
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q)
*  Breaking news, the Israeli military releasing new video [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=0.0s)]
*  purportedly showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar's final moments. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=3.0s)]
*  You see a drone flying through a damaged building. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=6.84s)]
*  Israel says that that man there sitting alone [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=9.48s)]
*  looking towards the drone, Sinwar. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=12.16s)]
*  And then you see him throw that piece of wood [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=14.76s)]
*  towards the drone, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=18.48s)]
*  He's well aware of what this drone would mean. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=19.52s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty incredible to think about this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=22.04s)]
*  as you could navigate a drone through a building like this, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=23.52s)]
*  that this is where he's sitting by himself. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=26.04s)]
*  I mean, all of it just bears watching again and again [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=28.52s)]
*  and again as we play it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=30.88s)]
*  And Israel says Sinwar was trying to escape to the north [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=32.32s)]
*  when he was killed in Rafa in Southern Gaza. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=35.44s)]
*  And US officials are now vowing to intensify efforts [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=38.96s)]
*  to negotiate a ceasefire and hostage deal. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris tonight [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=44.08s)]
*  calling for an end to the war. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=45.68s)]
*  This moment gives us an opportunity [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=49.36s)]
*  to finally end the war in Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  And it must end such that Israel is secure. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=57.28s)]
*  The hostages are released. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=61.84s)]
*  The suffering in Gaza ends. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  And the Palestinian people can realize their right [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=67.0s)]
*  to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=70.2s)]
*  And it is time for the day after to begin. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Nick Robertson is out front. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=82.12s)]
*  Once dubbed by the IDF a dead man walking, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=87.24s)]
*  the IDF says these are Yaya Sinwar's final moments, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=90.44s)]
*  recorded by a drone in the Gaza house where he died. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=95.64s)]
*  According to the IDF, he was discovered [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=100.48s)]
*  during a routine patrol, the building hit by tank fire. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=102.68s)]
*  His body spotted in the rubble. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=106.68s)]
*  Sinwar died while beaten, persecuted, and on the run. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=111.08s)]
*  He didn't die as a commander, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=114.88s)]
*  but as someone who only cared for himself. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=116.56s)]
*  In life, Sinwar had cultivated a tough image, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=120.92s)]
*  feared and fettered at home in Gaza, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  universally reviled by Israelis, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=127.72s)]
*  vilified for his leading role in Hamas's brutal [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=130.6s)]
*  October 7th slaughter of at least 1,200 people in Israel. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=133.84s)]
*  Journalist Ehud Yari was one of the few Israelis who met him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  When I was talking to him, he always insisted [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=143.72s)]
*  that we speak Hebrew and not Arabic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=148.12s)]
*  Yari interviewed Sinwar four times [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=150.56s)]
*  while the terror leader was in jail, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=153.68s)]
*  convicted of playing a role in the killing of two Israelis, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=155.64s)]
*  and four suspected Palestinian informers. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=159.76s)]
*  He was ruthless. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=163.24s)]
*  He used to send people to kill those prisoners [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=164.68s)]
*  whom he suspected of passing information [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=169.12s)]
*  to the intelligence of the prison service. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=172.28s)]
*  Born in a Gaza refugee camp to parents who fled their home [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=176.32s)]
*  in what is now Israel, in 1948, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=180.52s)]
*  following the Jewish state's creation, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=183.72s)]
*  Sinwar's cause was to reverse those land losses. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=185.84s)]
*  Hamas was the vehicle to do it. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=192.0s)]
*  He rose through its ranks as an enforcer, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=194.16s)]
*  becoming Gaza leader in 2017. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=197.4s)]
*  His message, uncompromising. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  During fighting in 2021, the IDF bombed his house. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=204.2s)]
*  A week later, at a rare press conference, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=209.2s)]
*  he goaded the IDF to take a second shot, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  saying he would walk home. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=215.44s)]
*  His luck finally running out now. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=217.76s)]
*  In Israel, people are celebrating, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=222.88s)]
*  the prime minister warning them it may be premature. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=225.27999999999997s)]
*  The fight with Hamas not done, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=229.32s)]
*  offering them survival or be chased down, like Sinwar. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=231.52s)]
*  I call on everyone who holds our hostages, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=235.84s)]
*  whoever leaves down his weapon and returns our hostages, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=239.04s)]
*  we will allow him to go out and live. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=242.0s)]
*  Hostage families again, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  calling for Netanyahu to get their loved ones home at any price. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=247.12s)]
*  Sinwar may be dead, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=255.12s)]
*  but the politics of both sides hasn't changed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=257.12s)]
*  It's far from clear Hamas will listen to Netanyahu, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=261.44s)]
*  and far from clear Netanyahu will cede to US wishes. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=265.04s)]
*  Make this the moment to end the Gaza war. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=269.88s)]
*  I mean, Nick, that footage is absolutely incredible. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=276.52s)]
*  The footage of what the IDF says is the drone [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=278.68s)]
*  as it was flying in, filming Sinwar, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=281.36s)]
*  then throwing that piece of wood. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=284.24s)]
*  And as I said, I've watched it 15 times. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm gonna keep watching. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=289.0s)]
*  There's something about it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=289.84s)]
*  Who is most likely though to succeed him? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=291.0s)]
*  And what does that say about what's next? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=294.96s)]
*  Yeah, look, one of them could be his brother, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  Mohammed Sinwar, and they've been joined at the hip, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  rising through the ranks together, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  they've fought together. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=305.4s)]
*  And right now his brother, Mohammed, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  is the head of the military wing of Hamas. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=309.23999999999995s)]
*  So, and oftentimes the IDF believes that they travel, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=311.2s)]
*  they had traveled around together. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  So if he steps in, he's gonna be hardline like Sinwar. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=316.52s)]
*  We can expect that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=318.64s)]
*  The next one up would be Khalid al-Hayyar. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=319.8s)]
*  Now he's been the sort of new number two, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=323.48s)]
*  since the old number two was killed. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=326.52s)]
*  He's been helping lead the negotiations, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=328.32s)]
*  and is seen as a bit more of a moderate than Sinwar, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=330.44s)]
*  but that's hard to judge. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=332.6s)]
*  And it's not really clear that he has the same kind [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=334.2s)]
*  of charisma with the fighters that Sinwar had. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=336.32s)]
*  And then the other person, kind of thrown into the mix, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=338.76s)]
*  somebody that Qataris might turn to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=342.12s)]
*  as they try to pressure Hamas to make a deal, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  because they're trying to deliver [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=346.56s)]
*  on what the United States wants here, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=348.16s)]
*  which is end of the war in Gaza. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=349.6s)]
*  Khalid Mishal, he was a former head of Hamas. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  He's been in exile and outside of Israel [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  for many, many years, decades. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=358.04s)]
*  But right now he's living in Doha, in Qatar, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=359.96000000000004s)]
*  and therefore if he were picked, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=363.76000000000005s)]
*  then he might be the one that could be [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=365.8s)]
*  the most moderate of all of those. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=367.88s)]
*  But right now it's just, frankly, unclear. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  And of course Sinwar had opted to stay there [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=374.15999999999997s)]
*  in Gaza throughout this war. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=377.8s)]
*  Nick, thank you very much. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=380.0s)]
*  Tonight, President Biden says he told [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=381.15999999999997s)]
*  the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=382.96s)]
*  that it's time to move on now that Sinwar is dead [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=385.28s)]
*  and move toward a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=388.68s)]
*  Let's get some more on this breaking story [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=391.2s)]
*  with our chief international correspondent, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=393.24s)]
*  Clarissa Ward, and CNN's Fareed Zakaria. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=395.52s)]
*  He's the host of Fareed Zakaria, GPS, here on CNN. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=397.88s)]
*  Fareed, Prime Minister Netanyahu says [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=401.24s)]
*  the war is still not over, at least not yet. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=403.56s)]
*  How big is the divide you sense between Israel [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=406.2s)]
*  and the United States on what comes next? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=408.88s)]
*  Well, it's still a pretty big divide. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  Look, what the Israeli defense forces [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  were able to do was remarkable, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=418.2s)]
*  but it provides an extraordinary opportunity. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=420.36s)]
*  It allows Israel to begin the process [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=423.24s)]
*  of ending the war, claiming victory. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=426.76s)]
*  Obviously, the most important unfinished business [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=430.6s)]
*  is the hostages, but it then allows Israel [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=434.6s)]
*  to start moving toward a post-war settlement. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=437.68s)]
*  And that is what the Biden administration [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=441.4s)]
*  has been arguing, and the Biden administration [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=443.56s)]
*  has lined up serious conversations [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=446.36s)]
*  with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=449.36s)]
*  about Israel normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=452.48s)]
*  but it would be part of a package [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=456.32s)]
*  where there would be some post-war authority in Gaza. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=458.44s)]
*  That would be maybe the Saudis, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=462.2s)]
*  maybe the Palestinian Authority would have to be involved, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=463.76s)]
*  and there would have to be some movement by Israel [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=467.12s)]
*  toward a Palestinian state. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=470.52s)]
*  So the Biden administration, even in its last days, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=471.79999999999995s)]
*  is trying very hard to see if they can take this [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=475.47999999999996s)]
*  and turn it into something that produces [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=478.91999999999996s)]
*  a more lasting political settlement. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=481.79999999999995s)]
*  The question is, does Bibi Netanyahu [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=484.12s)]
*  want to take this enormous victory [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=486.12s)]
*  and turn it into that settlement? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=489.24s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=490.64s)]
*  That would be huge indeed. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=492.0s)]
*  Clarissa, what's been the reaction [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=493.56s)]
*  to Sinwar's killing among Palestinians, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=495.44s)]
*  especially inside Gaza? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=497.96s)]
*  Well, it's interesting, Wolf, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=500.92s)]
*  because when you talk to people on camera, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=502.08s)]
*  they will largely pay lip service, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=504.36s)]
*  say that it's very sad that Yahya Sinwar has died, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=506.96s)]
*  but when you talk to people privately, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=510.08s)]
*  it's a different story. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=512.12s)]
*  There's a lot of bitterness towards Sinwar, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=513.16s)]
*  a lot of anger. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=515.12s)]
*  One woman told CNN, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=516.2s)]
*  he committed crimes that we have paid the price for. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=517.6800000000001s)]
*  Another Palestinian woman saying to me, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=521.32s)]
*  after the killing of Haniyeh, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=523.2800000000001s)]
*  Hamas's former political leader who was assassinated, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=524.96s)]
*  of Nasrallah, the former leader of Hezbollah [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=527.72s)]
*  who was assassinated, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=530.12s)]
*  we saw people crying in the streets. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=531.24s)]
*  We haven't yet seen any tears for Sinwar. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=533.6s)]
*  Now, it's entirely possible that we will see [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  sort of elaborate displays of mourning in the coming days, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=539.32s)]
*  but it appears to be that the more fundamental question [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=542.72s)]
*  for the vast majority of Gazans is really about survival. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=545.88s)]
*  I mean, we are talking about 42,000 people dead. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=550.68s)]
*  We are talking about famine or the brink of famine [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  throughout large parts of the enclave, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=556.84s)]
*  almost everybody displaced, disease, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=558.72s)]
*  the reemergence of polio. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=561.16s)]
*  And so for all the talk in the international community [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=563.2s)]
*  and from the Biden administration [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=565.72s)]
*  that this could be a pivotal moment, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=567.52s)]
*  that this could presage somehow, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=569.24s)]
*  at least the reemergence of those ceasefire talks [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=572.24s)]
*  that had essentially completely broken down for two months, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=575.0s)]
*  for people on the ground in Gaza, they are not optimistic. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=578.24s)]
*  They are understandably fairly despondent. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=582.24s)]
*  And as one man said to us, we need food and water. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=585.24s)]
*  That right now is more important than anything. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=588.84s)]
*  Farid, is there any sense that you're getting any sign [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=591.64s)]
*  that Prime Minister Netanyahu already has a real plan [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=594.24s)]
*  for what's called the day after in Gaza? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=597.88s)]
*  No, it seems as though the Prime Minister's plan [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=600.44s)]
*  has always been, I want tactical victories. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=603.2800000000001s)]
*  And tactical victories are important. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=606.1600000000001s)]
*  And to be fair to him and the IDF, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=608.0400000000001s)]
*  they have gotten a series of tactical victories, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=611.32s)]
*  the assassinations of Nasrallah and of Sinwar. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=613.84s)]
*  Sinwar particularly, remember, a very brutal man [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=617.72s)]
*  launched the October 7th attack, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  but also routinely killed Palestinians. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  He was called the butcher of Khan Yunus, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=625.84s)]
*  because he was butchering Palestinians [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=628.28s)]
*  who were against Hamas, who were looking for perhaps [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=630.28s)]
*  a peaceful path to a Palestinian state. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=633.48s)]
*  So this is a bad guy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=636.04s)]
*  But does Prime Minister Netanyahu have a plan? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=638.52s)]
*  No, because his problem is this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=642.88s)]
*  Any plan that involves Palestinian political rights [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=645.2s)]
*  will fracture his coalition, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=648.76s)]
*  which includes some very hard right elements [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=650.64s)]
*  that believe there should never be a Palestinian. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=653.52s)]
*  that believe there should never be a Palestinian state. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=656.1999999999999s)]
*  Clarissa, as you know, the USC is an opportunity [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=659.36s)]
*  to restart ceasefire talks, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=661.68s)]
*  but we don't know yet who will be [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=664.04s)]
*  the Hamas decision maker, do we? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=665.76s)]
*  We do not, and we have not heard anything from Hamas. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=669.0s)]
*  There is a lot of speculation about Mohammed Sinwar, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=671.76s)]
*  who is the brother of Yahya Sinwar. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=675.1999999999999s)]
*  He effectively replaced Mohammed Daif, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  who was killed in mid July in an Israeli strike [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=679.9599999999999s)]
*  as Hamas's military leader. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=683.36s)]
*  And up until August, the two, according to some US officials [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=685.28s)]
*  that CNN has spoken to, were frequently seen together. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=688.76s)]
*  It's not clear if Mohammed Sinwar was with his brother [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=692.08s)]
*  when he was killed or if he has survived, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=695.96s)]
*  but if he has survived, if he is the successor, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=698.08s)]
*  you can be sure that you will see a continuation [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=701.08s)]
*  of those kind of hardline approaches. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=704.16s)]
*  And until we know who that successor might be, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  there will continue to be this vacuum, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=709.6800000000001s)]
*  which really complicates efforts to try to seize the moment [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=711.5600000000001s)]
*  and turn this into an opportunity, Wolf. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=715.04s)]
*  Let's hope there is an opportunity. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=717.4s)]
*  Our Clarissa Worden for Reed Zakaria. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=718.76s)]
*  To both of you, thank you very much. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=720.5999999999999s)]
*  CIA Director under President Obama, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  retired US Army General David Petraeus joins us now. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=723.48s)]
*  His book, Conflict, The Evolution of Warfare [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=725.8s)]
*  from 1945 to Gaza, just came out in paperback. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=728.56s)]
*  General, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=732.56s)]
*  How do you predict Sinwar's death [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=734.8399999999999s)]
*  could alter the course of this war? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=737.52s)]
*  Do you agree with Clarissa? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=739.48s)]
*  There's an off-ramp for Netanyahu here, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=740.52s)]
*  but he just needs to articulate [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=743.36s)]
*  what post-war Gaza looks like. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  I think there is an opportunity here. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=749.2s)]
*  I'm not sure they're going to seize it, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  but first we should recognize how hugely significant [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=752.32s)]
*  this blow is to Hamas. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=755.6s)]
*  He was not just symbolic. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=757.9200000000001s)]
*  He was the leader overall, of course, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=759.5200000000001s)]
*  after the political leader was killed in Tehran. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=761.4000000000001s)]
*  So he was the political and military leader, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=764.84s)]
*  and he was the operational leader as well. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=767.0s)]
*  So unlike, say, Osama bin Laden, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=769.6400000000001s)]
*  who was killed during my final time in Afghanistan, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  who is symbolically hugely important, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=775.0s)]
*  but operationally not that significant, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=777.0799999999999s)]
*  in this case, he checks every single block. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=780.8s)]
*  Now, the question is, who will succeed him? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=784.04s)]
*  Will it be his brother? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=785.92s)]
*  Will it be someone else? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=786.88s)]
*  I suspect that the command control communications [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=788.04s)]
*  at this point is very decentralized, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=791.16s)]
*  but this does give an opportunity [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=794.0s)]
*  for Prime Minister Netanyahu to say, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=795.64s)]
*  we are now going to enter a new phase of the operations, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=797.28s)]
*  and in this phase, our objective is to achieve security [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=800.36s)]
*  in Gaza, which is not there now, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=804.16s)]
*  and to provide a better life [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=806.28s)]
*  for the Palestinians who live there, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=807.92s)]
*  sequentially clearing, holding, restoring basic services, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=810.64s)]
*  humanitarian assistance, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=815.76s)]
*  ending this really humanitarian disaster [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=817.72s)]
*  that is the lives, as Clarissa pointed out, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=820.76s)]
*  for the average Palestinians, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=823.96s)]
*  and creating a situation [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=825.96s)]
*  in which they don't want Hamas coming back, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  they don't want Palestinian Islamic Shi'aad stepping in, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=830.88s)]
*  because they do want better lives, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=833.92s)]
*  and I think there is an opportunity for that, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=836.28s)]
*  and by the way, also to truly destroy Hamas. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=838.7199999999999s)]
*  They're not destroyed yet, they've been decapitated, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=841.88s)]
*  they've been degraded very, very heavily, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=844.36s)]
*  but destruction means that they cannot reconstitute, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=846.8399999999999s)]
*  and as long as there is no security in Gaza, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=849.4s)]
*  the only security is that provided by criminal elements [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=852.9599999999999s)]
*  and remnants of Hamas, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=856.24s)]
*  they are going to continue to reconstitute, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=857.48s)]
*  at least in terms of their personnel, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=859.96s)]
*  even as, frankly, they cannot materially reconstitute, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=862.0s)]
*  because Israel rightly has taken control [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=866.2s)]
*  of the southern border between Gaza and the Sinai, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=868.28s)]
*  through which and under which, of course, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=872.28s)]
*  the material used to flow. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=873.96s)]
*  So I wonder, thinking about the Palestinian people, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=875.24s)]
*  and thinking about how they deserve so much better [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=878.96s)]
*  than what they're experiencing right now, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=881.9200000000001s)]
*  and thinking about how disastrous [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=883.44s)]
*  the leadership of Hamas has been for them, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=885.16s)]
*  is this not an opportunity also for Arab states, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=888.76s)]
*  for the King of Jordan, for President Sisi? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=892.4s)]
*  Not until their security. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=895.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, not until their security, but who would, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=897.0s)]
*  but only the Israelis could provide the security, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=899.04s)]
*  or is there a way that the, there's no way that the Arab, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=901.6s)]
*  the Arab League would not be able to go in there? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=905.04s)]
*  Arabs are not gonna fight, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=907.36s)]
*  Arabs are not gonna fight fellow Arabs, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=909.08s)]
*  however reprehensible and extreme they are, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=911.16s)]
*  they're not gonna fight fellow Arabs for Israel, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=914.5999999999999s)]
*  nor will the Palestinian. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=916.8s)]
*  No, not for Israel, but for, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=918.2399999999999s)]
*  For us, it could be introduced. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=919.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm just saying, like, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  if we're gonna try as a world to get to a post-war Gaza, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  it's not gonna, obviously it won't work [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=929.16s)]
*  with the Israelis occupying, right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=931.1999999999999s)]
*  We know what that looks like, and it doesn't work, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=933.04s)]
*  that's why the Israelis hold on. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=934.8s)]
*  It's the only alternative. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=935.64s)]
*  You think that's the only alternative? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=936.8s)]
*  It's the only way to achieve security. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=937.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  Now, I'm not talking about settlements, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=940.68s)]
*  you had settlements back when they occupied, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=941.7199999999999s)]
*  in the occupation, the creation of security [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=943.72s)]
*  should be explicitly described as temporary [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=947.12s)]
*  and based on conditions. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=950.28s)]
*  Then, once you have security, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=951.6800000000001s)]
*  you can bring in Palestinian security forces [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=953.6800000000001s)]
*  trained and equipped by the US [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=955.96s)]
*  and the Jordan International Police Training Center, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=957.36s)]
*  you can bring in Arab forces, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=959.48s)]
*  and they will come in, in that case, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=960.9200000000001s)]
*  but they're not going to come in and fight [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=962.8000000000001s)]
*  what will be seen as on behalf of Israel [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=965.8000000000001s)]
*  against fellow Arabs, and by the way, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=968.6800000000001s)]
*  take casualties, essentially for Israel. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=970.32s)]
*  I don't see any problem. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=972.88s)]
*  I've talked to Arab leaders about that, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=974.0s)]
*  I just don't see it. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=975.88s)]
*  I didn't mean like immediately, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=976.88s)]
*  I meant like with what you're talking about. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=978.72s)]
*  Is there any willingness of the Jordanians [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=981.3199999999999s)]
*  or the Arab League to, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=984.4399999999999s)]
*  let's say the Israelis came out and said, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=986.28s)]
*  Netanyahu said, we're gonna occupy Gaza [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=988.0s)]
*  for another six months, and then after that, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=991.52s)]
*  we need Arab forces or Palestinian forces [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=993.84s)]
*  to come over and provide security for the region, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=996.28s)]
*  and then we can talk about some sort of Palestinian state, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=998.12s)]
*  one way or another, is there a willingness [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1002.28s)]
*  by the Palestinian Authority and the West Bank, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1004.88s)]
*  by the Jordanians, et cetera, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1006.76s)]
*  to engage in that kind of discussion at all? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  If the Israelis establish security, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1012.84s)]
*  they are not occupying Gaza right now. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1014.64s)]
*  They are clearing and leaving, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1016.52s)]
*  they're conducting a raid and then departing. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1017.84s)]
*  They're not securing Gaza. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1020.2s)]
*  There is no real security in Gaza. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1022.16s)]
*  What you have are a series of criminal entities, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1024.28s)]
*  remnants of Hamas, remnants of Palestinian Islamic Shi'a, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1027.32s)]
*  and by the way, they are reconstituting. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1030.52s)]
*  There's plenty of recruits for Hamas 2.0 in there, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1032.3600000000001s)]
*  albeit not with all the material [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1034.8s)]
*  and the weaponry and ammunition [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1037.08s)]
*  that would be flowing normally through the Rafah crossing [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1038.4s)]
*  and under the southern border between Gaza and Egypt, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  but if they establish security, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1044.84s)]
*  and you and I have discussed how to do that, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1046.48s)]
*  is a series of gated communities [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1048.08s)]
*  such as we created in Fallujah, Ramadi, Bakuba. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1049.56s)]
*  You tell the Palestinian people explicit, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1052.24s)]
*  we were gonna make your lives better, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1054.3600000000001s)]
*  and the way we're gonna do it is we're gonna get Hamas [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1056.52s)]
*  and Pidge and these others out of your areas. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1058.72s)]
*  We're gonna gate them, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1061.72s)]
*  we're gonna give you biometric ID cards, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1062.64s)]
*  we're gonna get you back into shelter initially [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1064.44s)]
*  of some type that is better than tents. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1067.64s)]
*  As the homes are rebuilt, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1069.76s)]
*  the basic services are restored, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1071.04s)]
*  reconstruction proceeds. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1073.92s)]
*  Then you'll see Arab states sending not just money, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1075.48s)]
*  but also security forces to augment them. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1079.8s)]
*  You'll see the opportunity for Palestinians, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1082.38s)]
*  security forces to come in as well, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1085.2s)]
*  and then even local governance can be. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1087.52s)]
*  So the Israelis will continue to thin out [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1089.28s)]
*  as they go presumably from north to south, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1091.84s)]
*  again, creating these gated communities. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1094.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think Jake is the only realistic option [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1097.04s)]
*  for actually how to provide a better life [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1100.94s)]
*  for the Palestinian people, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1102.8s)]
*  which is the crucial element here that has been missing. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1103.84s)]
*  There's no vision for the day after. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1106.76s)]
*  And even the Minister of Defense, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1108.76s)]
*  Yoav Golan has called for a political vision for Gaza, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1110.72s)]
*  and that has not been forthcoming. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1115.76s)]
*  This would provide that. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1117.28s)]
*  And then you could have a situation, again, ideally, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1118.8s)]
*  some years down the road, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1121.62s)]
*  where you actually see Palestinians and Israeli Jews [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1123.36s)]
*  living side by side in peace. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1125.8799999999999s)]
*  General David Petraeus, thank you as always. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1128.44s)]
*  Appreciate your time and expertise. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1130.04s)]
*  How significant is this, Tom? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1132.0s)]
*  Well, this is obviously huge, Anderson, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1137.3999999999999s)]
*  because Yahya Sinwar planned this war, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1140.6s)]
*  led this war, directed this war. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1143.44s)]
*  Without him, there's really only one significant [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1146.4s)]
*  Hamas leader left in Gaza. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1150.4s)]
*  That's his brother, Mohammed. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1151.72s)]
*  And it is the necessary, but not sufficient condition [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1154.16s)]
*  to end this war and put Israelis and Palestinians [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1157.8600000000001s)]
*  on a new trajectory. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1160.92s)]
*  What would that actually look like? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1162.94s)]
*  I know Secretary Blinken has been doing a lot of diplomacy. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1164.44s)]
*  He said the United States will, quote, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1169.8400000000001s)]
*  redouble its efforts with partners to end this conflict. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1171.1000000000001s)]
*  I know you've reported on this. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1174.5600000000002s)]
*  What do you see as a possible way forward? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1176.92s)]
*  Well, basically, Secretary Blinken, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1181.3200000000002s)]
*  the leader of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1184.52s)]
*  the leadership in the United Arab Emirates, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1188.76s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1190.5600000000002s)]
*  they've all basically, for the last month, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1192.28s)]
*  been in a kind of quiet dialogue [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1194.3200000000002s)]
*  to create a morning after scenario for Gaza. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1196.92s)]
*  It's a multi-step process, Anderson. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1201.28s)]
*  Step one, you get President Mahmoud Abbas [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1203.34s)]
*  of the Palestinian Authority to appoint someone [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1206.3s)]
*  like As-Salam Fayyad, a high-quality, respected, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1210.22s)]
*  non-corrupt leader to be the prime minister [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1214.98s)]
*  of a completely reformed Palestinian Authority. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1218.04s)]
*  Step two, you get that Palestinian Authority [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1220.54s)]
*  to issue an invitation to the UAE, Egypt, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1223.3799999999999s)]
*  other Arab states, European countries, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1227.6599999999999s)]
*  to create an international peacekeeping force [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1230.3799999999999s)]
*  of which PA soldiers would be members [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1232.54s)]
*  to basically phase into Gaza as Israel phases out [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1235.62s)]
*  and take over security there. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1239.58s)]
*  Stage three, Israel commits to a dialogue [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1241.7s)]
*  with the Palestinian Authority on a two-state solution, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1247.58s)]
*  which creates then the context for Saudi Arabia [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1250.82s)]
*  to normalize relations with Israel [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1253.5s)]
*  and open the way basically for relations between Israel [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1255.9s)]
*  and the wider Muslim world. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1259.06s)]
*  Obviously, the million things that can go wrong here, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1260.74s)]
*  but there is a plan, it's being seriously discussed. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1264.08s)]
*  The question is, for it to succeed, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1267.06s)]
*  Netanyahu really would have to agree to blow up his cabinet, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1270.1s)]
*  to replace several of the far-right, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1272.7s)]
*  crazy, lunatic, messianic members of his cabinet [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1278.38s)]
*  who play key roles in it, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1281.46s)]
*  replace them with more centrist politicians, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1283.54s)]
*  and to take a risk on a peace with Saudi Arabia, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1286.24s)]
*  but also realizing that somehow Israel's got [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1290.84s)]
*  to fill the vacuum in Gaza. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1293.96s)]
*  It's either gonna be filled by remnants of a Hamas, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1296.32s)]
*  it's either gonna be a Hamas insurgency, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1299.96s)]
*  a permanent Israeli occupation, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1302.28s)]
*  or an Arab peacekeeping force [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1304.48s)]
*  that pays the way for a two-state solution. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1306.2s)]
*  I mean, Netanyahu has done everything possible [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1308.18s)]
*  over the last many years to undercut [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1310.58s)]
*  Palestinian authority and Mahmoud Abbas's authority, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1313.0s)]
*  and actually funding, allowing money to go to Hamas [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1316.84s)]
*  in order to keep the possibility [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1320.84s)]
*  of a two-state solution off the table. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1323.38s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, do you think he sees this as, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1325.52s)]
*  do you think this is a possibility [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1330.68s)]
*  that he would go along with this? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1331.96s)]
*  Because obviously, anything that Saudi Arabia [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1333.24s)]
*  would be involved with, they would only do it [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1335.92s)]
*  if this was to, on paper, lead to a two-state solution. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1338.24s)]
*  He has designated his closest advisor, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1343.12s)]
*  strategic minister, minister of strategy or strategic affairs, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1346.44s)]
*  Ron Dermott, former ambassador to Washington, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1349.46s)]
*  to engage in this dialogue with the administration, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1351.88s)]
*  with the UAE, and with others. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1355.44s)]
*  So he's clearly probing it, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1358.24s)]
*  but he has a history of probing things [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1361.0s)]
*  and not closing them. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1362.84s)]
*  So, but all I can say to you, Anderson, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1363.8s)]
*  is that Israel now has achieved [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1367.0s)]
*  a major military victory in Gaza. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1369.36s)]
*  But it remains a tactical victory. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1372.74s)]
*  To translate that tactical victory into a strategic victory [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1374.66s)]
*  that gives real security for Israelis and Palestinians [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1378.76s)]
*  and brings this thing to some kind of ending, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1381.38s)]
*  he's gonna have to take a risk. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1384.86s)]
*  He's gonna have to prove that he is the Turchilian figure [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1386.34s)]
*  that he claims to be. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1389.74s)]
*  Call him a dubious, but at the same time, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1391.72s)]
*  I'm asking myself, without him taking that step, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1394.58s)]
*  how does Israel translate this tactical victory [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1398.06s)]
*  into a strategic victory? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1400.98s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar, I mean, I saw some people online [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1403.3s)]
*  portraying him as sort of a messianic figure. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1406.46s)]
*  Just to be clear, not only did he take part [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1409.66s)]
*  in this terror on October 7th and other terrorist acts, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1412.06s)]
*  he also killed a lot of Palestinians. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1417.34s)]
*  I mean, he was head of the internal security for Hamas. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1419.16s)]
*  I remember being in Gaza years ago [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1422.5s)]
*  and seeing Palestinians being dragged through the streets [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1424.94s)]
*  on the backs of motorcycles, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1428.14s)]
*  chained to the back of a motorcycle, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1429.94s)]
*  their bodies dragged through the streets [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1432.1s)]
*  who were viewed as collaborators. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1433.3799999999999s)]
*  He was the guy who was executing a lot of Palestinians. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1434.98s)]
*  Look, I mean, there had been two uprising [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1439.1399999999999s)]
*  against Hamas in 2019 and 2021 among Gazans. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1441.62s)]
*  They were called, you know, We Wanna Live. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1447.06s)]
*  That was the name of the uprising. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1449.2199999999998s)]
*  So this was an Islamofascist organization. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1450.6599999999999s)]
*  And yes, he had his supporters, obviously, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1453.82s)]
*  but over the last year, given what happened in Gaza, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1456.54s)]
*  which is basically Anderson, what Sinwar did, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1459.78s)]
*  it was a human sacrifice. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1462.54s)]
*  He attacked Israel in a way [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1463.98s)]
*  that he knew would produce this reaction. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1465.26s)]
*  He provided no warning, no shelter for any of his people [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1467.46s)]
*  in light of the Israeli onslaught. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1473.78s)]
*  He in effect traded thousands of Palestinian lives [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1475.66s)]
*  for the next generation on TikTok [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1479.84s)]
*  to win the support of the next generation. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1482.7s)]
*  By the way, it worked. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1484.42s)]
*  It was a very effective strategy. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1485.26s)]
*  If you're interested in public affairs for Palestinians, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1487.24s)]
*  but if you're interested in a state for Palestinians, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1489.76s)]
*  it's been a disaster. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1492.2s)]
*  And my only regret, frankly, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1493.92s)]
*  is that it was Palestinians who didn't, in the end, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1495.8400000000001s)]
*  finish him off, but in fact, Israelis. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1498.88s)]
*  Tom Freeman, thank you. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_78nhvnM01Q&t=1501.4s)]
