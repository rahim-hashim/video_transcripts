# ‘Completely untrue’: Biden envoy to Netanyahu on his comments about US-supplied weapons
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w)
*  There are new signs of the Biden administration's deep frustration right now with the Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=0.0s)]
*  prime minister. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=5.04s)]
*  CNN is now reporting that an envoy for the president told Benjamin Netanyahu that the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=6.04s)]
*  new video of Netanyahu saying the U.S. was withholding military aid to Israel was, quote, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=11.08s)]
*  unproductive and completely untrue. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=17.04s)]
*  The White House also canceled one of its meetings with Israeli officials in response to this [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=20.02s)]
*  Netanyahu video. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=24.76s)]
*  I want to go to our White House correspondent Arlette Saenz. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=25.92s)]
*  She's joining us from Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, where the president is today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=29.08s)]
*  Arlette, update our viewers on what's going on. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=33.08s)]
*  Well, there is a growing sense of frustration among Biden administration officials towards [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=35.64s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after his comments in that video yesterday [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=42.64s)]
*  say that it was inconceivable that the U.S. is withholding military aid for Russia. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=47.46s)]
*  That is something that White House press secretary, Kareem Jean-Pierre, just yesterday said that [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=53.16s)]
*  they have no idea what Netanyahu is talking about there. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=56.8s)]
*  And privately, the administration has also started conveying their frustration directly [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=60.48s)]
*  to Netanyahu. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=65.44s)]
*  CNN has learned that Amos Hoxstein, who had been traveling in the region, met with Netanyahu [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=66.92s)]
*  yesterday and told him very frankly that his comments were unproductive and, more importantly, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=71.34s)]
*  completely untrue. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=77.56s)]
*  The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, was also meeting with Netanyahu and reiterated [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=79.06s)]
*  that these comments were incorrect, actually running through the types of weapons that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  the U.S. has been sending to Israel over the past few months. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=88.8s)]
*  Now, it's unclear what exactly Netanyahu was referencing here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=92.64s)]
*  In early May, we know that the administration had put a pause on the shipment of some heavy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  bombs to Israel amid concerns about its operations in Tiratha. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=103.0s)]
*  Just yesterday, both Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the White House press secretary [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  said that that is still under review, but that there haven't been any other pauses in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=111.92s)]
*  the shipments. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=116.48s)]
*  Take a listen to what Jean-Pierre had to tell reporters yesterday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=117.48s)]
*  We generally do not know what he's talking about. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=121.76s)]
*  We just don't. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=125.2s)]
*  There was one particular shipment of munitions that was paused. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=126.2s)]
*  There are no other pauses, none. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=130.74s)]
*  No other pauses or holds in place. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=132.76s)]
*  Now, one senior administration official told us that the U.S. postponed a meeting that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=139.08s)]
*  they were supposed to have with the Israelis to talk about Iran, in part due to these comments. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  So we also have heard from other officials pushing back, saying that it's not because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=148.84s)]
*  of the comments from Netanyahu, that there were simply some scheduling issues. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=152.78s)]
*  But this does come at an incredibly tense time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=156.28s)]
*  We have often seen these frustrations between the U.S. and Israel aired out in public, but [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=158.84s)]
*  it comes as there's tensions. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. wants Israel to do more to try to put an end to this conflict in Gaza, and then [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=166.16s)]
*  there's concerns about the possibility of this conflict widening even further. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  So we will see what more both sides have to say as the days continue, but it's clear that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=175.6s)]
*  there is a palpable sense of frustration from the Biden administration towards Netanyahu [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=181.28s)]
*  because of these comments. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=186.28s)]
*  That's absolutely clear. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=187.72s)]
*  Arlette Saenz reporting from Rehoboth Beach in Delaware, where the president is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=188.72s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=193.24s)]
*  I want to get some analysis right now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=194.24s)]
*  Joining us now, the former U.S. defense secretary and former CIA director during the Obama [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=195.76s)]
*  administration, Leon Panetta. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  Secretary Panetta, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=202.2s)]
*  The Biden administration, as you just heard, is calling Netanyahu's comments completely [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=205.04s)]
*  untrue and unproductive. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=209.4s)]
*  You've done a lot of work in U.S.-Israeli relations over the years at the CIA, the Defense [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=211.36s)]
*  Department, when you were in Congress, when you were at the White House. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=217.76s)]
*  Give us your sense of what's going on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=220.84s)]
*  How serious is this rupture in U.S.-Israeli relations at this critical moment right now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, Wolf, in my experience, the one predictable thing about Netanyahu is that he is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=230.72s)]
*  unpredictable, whether whether it was working with President Clinton or President Obama. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=237.2s)]
*  My experience was that it was always very difficult to try to figure out exactly what [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=244.76s)]
*  Netanyahu was up to. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=251.04s)]
*  And so you had to basically try to understand that he is always about survival, survival [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=253.2s)]
*  in office. And I think for some reason he decided to come out and attack the United [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=262.68s)]
*  States, although we are providing billions of dollars of weapons to Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=269.88s)]
*  There is a pause with regards to one shipment, but that's it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  So it clearly is not true that we have not continued to provide assistance to Israel. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=280.0s)]
*  So we've just got to straighten out the record and determine whether or not ultimately we [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  can reestablish a relationship, because this is a very sensitive time in terms of the war [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  with Hamas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=299.04s)]
*  You make a very, very important point to all of this coming, Mr. Secretary, just a day [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=299.92s)]
*  after the U.S. actually greenlit one of the largest ever weapons packages to Israel, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=304.72s)]
*  including F-15 fighter jets, billions and billions of dollars worth of weaponry. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=309.92s)]
*  And the Biden administration was leaning heavily on key Democrats in the House and Senate to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=314.8s)]
*  support this package, which eventually they clearly did do. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=320.12s)]
*  So what do you think Netanyahu is hoping to achieve here? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's what concerns me more than anything is the decision not to go ahead with [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=327.76s)]
*  the meeting on Iran. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=333.56s)]
*  The problem right now is Iran is within a very few weeks of being able to build a nuclear [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  weapon. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=342.4s)]
*  They've got a lot of enriched fuel. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=343.4s)]
*  And if Iran gets a hold of a nuclear weapon, that could be a real threat to stability in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=346.44s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=353.12s)]
*  And so I hope that ultimately they can try to reestablish a relationship here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=353.92s)]
*  We've gone through a lot of ups and downs in the relationship with Netanyahu. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=360.24s)]
*  But the fact is right now, Israel is at a point where they are successful in trying to [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=364.76s)]
*  diminish Hamas's ability to be able to conduct warfare there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=373.16s)]
*  And if we could demilitarize Hamas completely, get rid of the tunnels, get rid of the support [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=378.56s)]
*  systems they have and their depots, I think we could move on to try to establish some [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=386.56s)]
*  kind of governance system for Gaza, kind of protect the border so that weapons don't [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=392.44s)]
*  continue to come into Hamas and create a better situation ultimately to try to get rid of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=398.44s)]
*  the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=405.44s)]
*  And, you know, on top of all of this, all the other threats that are going on right now, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=408.74s)]
*  Israel is now publicly warning of the prospect of a quote all out war with the Iranian [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=414.96s)]
*  back his ball of forces in south Lebanon after that militant group published drone video [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=420.68s)]
*  showing Israeli military and civilian locations around Haifa. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=426.44s)]
*  Very sensitive locations. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=430.64s)]
*  How concerned are you about this potential escalation that could happen? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=432.24s)]
*  We always have to be very concerned about what could happen with Hezbollah as well as [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=439.88s)]
*  what could happen with the other proxy forces in that region. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=446.4s)]
*  If if for some reason, Iran gives the go ahead to Hezbollah to continue the kind of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=451.32s)]
*  assaults we've seen over these last few weeks, then I think there really is a chance [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=459.0s)]
*  for continuing war in the Middle East because Israel cannot afford to just simply [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=465.72s)]
*  allow Hezbollah to continue to send hundreds of missiles into Israel and not respond to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=474.36s)]
*  that threat. So this is, as I said, a very sensitive time in which, frankly, the United [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=480.52s)]
*  States and Israel and our allies in the Middle East have to work together to try to figure [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=487.04s)]
*  out how we provide for better security in the region. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it's so, so critically important. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  Such a sensitive moment indeed. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=498.8s)]
*  As someone who has covered that part of the world for many, many years, it's really [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=500.72s)]
*  potentially extremely dangerous. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  And as a result, the Israelis have already forced the tens of thousands of Israelis who [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=506.48s)]
*  live in northern Israel, north of Haifa, the Galilee, near the Lebanese border to evacuate [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  because they're deeply concerned that the situation could escalate into a full scale war, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=516.96s)]
*  which would make Israel's war with Hamas and Gaza look like relatively small potatoes compared [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=521.76s)]
*  to what could happen with Hezbollah in south Lebanon and Israel in the north. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=527.52s)]
*  Leon Panetta, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=532.32s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=534.48s)]
*  Good to be with you, Walt. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVaNT_6xN3w&t=536.32s)]
