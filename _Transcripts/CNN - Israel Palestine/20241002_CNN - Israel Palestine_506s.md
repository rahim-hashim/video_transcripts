# Ex-NATO Commander explains what Israel’s most strategic next move is
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo)
*  A day after Iran launched its largest ever ballistic missile attack on Israel, despite [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=0.0s)]
*  some strikes on Israeli bases, the damage was thankfully minimal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=5.78s)]
*  Still, Israel is vowing retribution as President Biden implores the Israelis to not retaliate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=10.6s)]
*  against Iran's nuclear sites. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=16.86s)]
*  All of this, as Israel continues its campaign to the north in Lebanon, trying to dismantle [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=18.76s)]
*  the Iran-backed organization Hezbollah, which the United States considers to be a terrorist [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=23.62s)]
*  group. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=27.580000000000002s)]
*  We have Ben Shudow, who's in Tel Aviv, and Ben Wiedemann in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=28.58s)]
*  Ben, let's start with you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=31.9s)]
*  Your team just heard several loud explosions in Beirut. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=32.9s)]
*  What exactly is going on in Lebanon right now? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  Well, what we heard is just a few minutes ago, some sharp blasts. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=39.7s)]
*  And I'm going to step out of the way. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=45.66s)]
*  I think you can still perhaps see some of the smoke that's still there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=47.06s)]
*  This is the heart of Beirut. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=52.5s)]
*  This is not the southern suburbs. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  This is the general area where you will find the prime ministry and you will find the fortunately [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=56.34s)]
*  currently empty CNN bureau. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=63.580000000000005s)]
*  As I said, this is the second time since Sunday night that there have been Israeli airstrikes [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=66.7s)]
*  outside of the heart of Beirut. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=71.5s)]
*  And just about 40 minutes before that, we heard three very large explosions from the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=75.78s)]
*  southern suburbs with smoke just wafting all over the city. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=82.7s)]
*  We did the first strike that was about 40 minutes ago. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=88.7s)]
*  The Israelis did put out a statement that they have struck a target in Beirut. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=93.26s)]
*  Details to follow the statement indicated. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=99.26s)]
*  But this comes after a day in which we've seen intense fighting between Hezbollah and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=102.54s)]
*  Israeli forces on Lebanese soil. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  We've heard that at least eight Israeli soldiers have been killed in those clashes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=112.46s)]
*  And so we haven't seen sort of the kind of full scale ground presence by Israeli forces [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=118.98s)]
*  in south Lebanon. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=126.02s)]
*  Perhaps they're probing at this point, but clearly despite Israel's severe pounding of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  the southern suburbs of the southern part of Lebanon along the border, clearly Hezbollah [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=134.3s)]
*  has a sizable presence and is able to challenge Israeli forces. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  Just one last detail. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  The Ministry of Health has come out with its death toll over the last 24 hours. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=148.38000000000002s)]
*  Forty-six dead, 85 wounded as this war continues. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=155.02s)]
*  Jake? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=160.74s)]
*  All right, Ben, thanks so much. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=161.74s)]
*  Jim, what are your sources telling you about how Israel might retaliate? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=163.02s)]
*  Well, there was a sense, Jake, last night that that retaliation might come within hours [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=168.74s)]
*  of the Israeli, of the Iranian missile barrage on Israel, including here in Tel Aviv. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=174.7s)]
*  That passed, of course, last night passed, and we're getting quite late here as well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=181.54s)]
*  It appears that Israeli leaders may have taken a pause on this decision as they decide the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=186.02s)]
*  next course. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=191.38s)]
*  They made it quite public that they attend a response, serious consequences. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=192.38s)]
*  But there is also some communication going back and forth between Tel Aviv and Washington [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=197.54s)]
*  about how that retaliation takes shape with both private and very public messaging right [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=202.78s)]
*  up to President Biden indicating the U.S. does not want Israel to go so far as to attack [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=209.62s)]
*  Iran's nuclear facilities, that the U.S. fears that strike. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  And by the way, this is not a new fear of the U.S., that that strike would greatly expand [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=219.86s)]
*  this war and might, frankly, drag the U.S. into an open conflict between Israel and Iran [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=224.18s)]
*  that the U.S. does not want to be a part of. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=230.62s)]
*  And it's quite interesting, Jake, because just as U.S. officials were telling me when [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=232.46s)]
*  Israel sent those ground forces into southern Lebanon or when Israel took out Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=237.1s)]
*  just as they were telling me then, they were not involved in those strikes, they're signaling [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=242.86s)]
*  quite clearly now that the U.S. would not be involved in an Israeli strike on Iranian [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=248.26000000000002s)]
*  nuclear facilities if it were to choose that path. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  All right, Jim Sciutto, Ben Wheatman, thank you so much to both of you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=255.46s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=258.74s)]
*  Joining us now to discuss retired U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, the former [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=259.74s)]
*  NATO Supreme Allied Commander of Europe. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=262.94s)]
*  General, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=266.06s)]
*  So Israel is warning that it has the means to strike anywhere in the Middle East. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=267.74s)]
*  What do you see as Israel's most strategic next step? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=272.14s)]
*  What would you advise Israel to do? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=276.1s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me on. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=278.06s)]
*  And I think we have to go back to the first set of strikes earlier in the year where they [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  shot 110 missiles in. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=286.54s)]
*  And because the U.S. and others helped Israel intercept those, the effect was low and the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=289.18s)]
*  United States implored Israel to not respond in a big way. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  And Israel led a very, very measured response. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=301.18s)]
*  So now Iran is back with a much larger strike. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=305.18s)]
*  And I think what it's going to be hard this time to convince Israel to not have a more [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=309.74s)]
*  forceful reply. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=315.56s)]
*  There are multiple things they could strike. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  They could strike the petrochemical infrastructure. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=319.62s)]
*  They could strike military targets. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=322.78s)]
*  And of course, they could strike the nuclear program. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=325.09999999999997s)]
*  The U.S. assesses that Israel has destroyed about 50 percent of Hezbollah's arsenal. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=329.34s)]
*  What's your assessment of Iran's overall military strength, including its proxies such as Hezbollah, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=333.94s)]
*  such as Hamas, the Houthis, and the militias in Syria and Iraq? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=341.5s)]
*  How strong are Israel's immediately surrounding enemies right now? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, clearly Israel has struck a blow. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=351.7s)]
*  And the most important blow is they have eliminated essentially the top three echelons of leadership. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=357.09999999999997s)]
*  And so the program is in disarray because the leaders are gone. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=363.4s)]
*  But if you believe the numbers that people have quoted about Hezbollah's arsenal and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  Iran's arsenal, there is quite a few weapons left that could be sent Israel's way. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=375.44s)]
*  Today we learned that eight IDF soldiers have been killed in Lebanon since the offensive [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  began. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  Would you assess that to be an unusual number for Israel in an offensive like this? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=391.88s)]
*  Well, it's a tragic number. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=398.04s)]
*  But remember that urban warfare is the worst. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=401.32s)]
*  We encountered this in Iraq and other places. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=405.36s)]
*  When you are doing urban warfare in the modern world, this is the toughest mission you can [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  throw at a land force. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=415.12s)]
*  And so in some places, Israel is going in in very cramped confined spaces and it makes [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=416.92s)]
*  it very tough on their soldiers. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  So this is not unusual. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=426.56s)]
*  In fact, frankly, I would have expected the numbers to have been higher. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  I also want to get your take on Israel's strategy at this stage. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=432.72s)]
*  IDF forces are making a quick targeted incursions into Lebanon, urban warfare as you know, then [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  withdrawing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=440.48s)]
*  The IDF said today it also clashed with Hezbollah's forces at, quote, close range. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  Why do you think Israel is avoiding a full on ground invasion right now, doing more of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=446.48s)]
*  these targeted strikes? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=452.12s)]
*  Well, I think that we should be happy that that's the attack that they're taking. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=454.32s)]
*  They're being very surgical. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=460.96s)]
*  As you said before, they have hit some of the largest caches of weapons and they have [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=462.58s)]
*  hit some of the command and control targets. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=468.52s)]
*  You were talking at the top of the hour there with with folks about the strikes into the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=472.4s)]
*  heart of Beirut. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=476.96s)]
*  And may I assure you that if they're doing that, they are targeting a very specific target [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=479.12s)]
*  and trying to minimize collateral damage. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=485.32s)]
*  But remember, just like Hamas, Hezbollah wraps itself in innocence. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  It intends for an innocence to die. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=495.12s)]
*  That way the world will control Israel for them. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=498.52s)]
*  Retired General Philip Breedlove, thank you so much, General. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGjJ8u1mfIo&t=502.52s)]
