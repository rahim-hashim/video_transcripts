# Hamas leader was killed by explosive device planted months before explosion, source says
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY)
*  More breaking news right now and this coming from the Middle East tension skyrocketing there after [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=0.0s)]
*  Assassinations this week and we are getting right now some brand new details about [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=6.48s)]
*  exactly how the assassination of the Hamas political leader Ismael Hanaiah went down and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=10.92s)]
*  This these are incredible details that Jeremy Diamond is breaking [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=16.72s)]
*  He's in Haifa Israel and northern Israel right now and Jeremy these details are pretty stunning [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=19.82s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt about it Aaron, I mean this was quite sophisticated operation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=24.9s)]
*  I'm told by a source familiar with the matter that Ismael Hanaiah was assassinated in Tehran early yesterday morning using a bomb [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=29.619999999999997s)]
*  That was covertly hidden in the guest house where he was staying, but this bomb I'm told was actually [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=37.22s)]
*  Covertly planted inside that guest house about two months ago [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=43.62s)]
*  And it was only remotely detonated once it was clear that Ismael Hanaiah was assassinated [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=48.18s)]
*  Ismael Hanaiah Hamas's political leader was actually inside his room inside of that guest house [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=53.46s)]
*  When that bomb was detonated he was killed alongside his bodyguard who was also there now [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=60.14s)]
*  We should note that Israel has still neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in this Iranian officials and Hamas have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=66.76s)]
*  Said that Israel was behind this attack. I'm also told that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=73.98s)]
*  Israel Israeli officials actually briefed US officials on this operation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=78.54s)]
*  But only after it took place only after we learned that Ismael Hanaiah had been killed in this [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=83.3s)]
*  What's also interesting here is that this guest house was actually under the control of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=89.86s)]
*  And so this represents a stunning breach of security for them a very big embarrassment for the IRGC [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  And we've reached out to Iranian officials for comments on this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=103.24s)]
*  But we know of course that we heard yesterday from [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=106.9s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader vowing revenge saying that Israel has quote paved the way for your harsh punishment [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=109.58s)]
*  This assassination has put this region on a knife's edge in addition of course to the Israeli strike in Beirut [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=117.06s)]
*  Just hours before this that took out a senior Hezbollah commander [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=125.78s)]
*  There are now threats of retaliation not only from Iran [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=129.46s)]
*  But also from Hezbollah and Hamas putting this region and this area where I am right now in northern Israel [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=132.7s)]
*  Very much on edge as the possibility of retaliation now looms Erin [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=139.02s)]
*  Thank you very much Jeremy diamond [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=144.58s)]
*  Cedric Leighton joins me now Colonel Cedric Leighton is Colonel [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=147.58s)]
*  Jeremy's reporting is really stunning and he mentioned this but let's just emphasize this again. He is reporting that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=151.02s)]
*  sensibly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=157.94s)]
*  Some Israeli operative although they have not confirmed their involvement [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=159.74s)]
*  Planted an IED in Tehran in a guest house controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps the elite [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  IRGC two months ago, and then remotely detonated it when they knew that the guy they wanted to get was actually staying in that house [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=170.98s)]
*  Holy cow [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=178.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, holy cow is right here, and this is a classic operation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=180.17999999999998s)]
*  And you know kind of in line with the tradition of Israeli intelligence going back [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=184.1s)]
*  Almost to the founding of Israel and what the Israelis if they did this [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=189.38s)]
*  What they were able to do was Jeremy pointed out was breach security in a really remarkable way [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=193.78s)]
*  The IRGC the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is very much in control of a lot of different aspects of Iranian life [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=200.54000000000002s)]
*  But they weren't in direct control of this guest house which was ostensibly their own guest house and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=208.54000000000002s)]
*  Whoever breached this and you know the supposition is that it was Israel [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  But whoever did this did a remarkable job and the fact also has to be noted that this was not detected for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=218.7s)]
*  Probably over two months if you know if Jeremy's reporting is into sources are accurate so that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=225.94s)]
*  That really indicates that you know people were quite frankly [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=232.42s)]
*  overcome by [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=237.82s)]
*  You know by their own sloppiness in this particular case and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=239.18s)]
*  This this very fact on the Iranian side shows that Israel has been able to penetrate [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=243.38s)]
*  Their security apparatus quite a bit and that of course [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=249.38s)]
*  Signals some major weaknesses in the Iranian structure [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=254.18s)]
*  I mean Jeremy just to emphasize this and I know obviously [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=257.3s)]
*  I don't know if you're reporting is is how detailed it is on the form of an IED [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=260.78s)]
*  But you have an improvised explosive device inside a guest house [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=264.26s)]
*  Which would presumably mean no one was sweeping it or checking it before this Hamas leader came in or in fact anytime in the past [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=268.78s)]
*  Two months which would seem to be just a really basic [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=276.26s)]
*  basic point of protocol [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=279.74s)]
*  Yeah, look we don't know exactly what kind of explosive device this was we don't know exactly where it was hidden whether this was something [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=283.46s)]
*  That could have evaded the typical checks that the IRGC would conduct on this, but I think one clear [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  Failure of security here is the fact that this guest house the reason why this bomb was planted there is because it was a guest [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=297.46000000000004s)]
*  House where Ismail Hania was known to have stayed and so this indicates that Hania was a repeat guest in this same [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=303.94s)]
*  Location which is obviously a security a major security [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  Vulnerability that the Israelis appear to have exploited here [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  And so we don't know exactly how this happened, but there's no question that there will be [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=320.5s)]
*  Major questions asked within the IRGC within Iran's top political and military echelons about how this could have possibly [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=326.54s)]
*  Happened and I also think it's notable that yesterday Iranian state media was reporting that this was a rocket that was fired from outside [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=334.82s)]
*  Into this guest house that actually killed Hania [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=343.74s)]
*  But the fact that it was actually something that was planted in the guest house suggests even additional layers of failure [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=346.98s)]
*  It also makes clear that this was not fired by a drone or by a fighter jet that would have violated [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=353.74s)]
*  Iranian airspace so that also may factor into how Iran chooses to retaliate for this assassination [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=361.3s)]
*  And that's a significant point as well [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=367.78000000000003s)]
*  Colonel it also though what Jeremy's saying does just make one thing sort of unbelievably clear [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=370.58s)]
*  So let's just say it in black and white that means a human being is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=376.42s)]
*  Involved who's in Tehran who actually gets access to this guest house and plants on that at some point [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=379.3s)]
*  There is a human being infiltration [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=384.02s)]
*  Which is different than what Jeremy's saying they had originally been put out there about a rocket or a drone right which could be completely [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=386.82s)]
*  Done remotely that shows an actual physical human involvement Colonel [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=393.18s)]
*  It does absolutely and it's really a classic case of in essence a clandestine operation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=397.5s)]
*  These are the kinds of operations you would have seen the British conducted in World War two with a special operations executive [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=403.09999999999997s)]
*  In Europe you would have seen the OSS the forerunner of the CIA doing stuff like this [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=409.7s)]
*  So also in that conflict and the Mossad has a history of doing things of this type [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=414.9s)]
*  In various countries around the world and of course Iran is a prime target [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=420.58s)]
*  We know a lot about the you know many of the nuclear scientists who have been killed in Iran ostensibly by the Israelis [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=425.38s)]
*  that kind of operation and the fact that these things are continuing that there's such a [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=432.38s)]
*  significant penetration of IRGC security at a guest house that is frequented by people like Ania that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=437.85999999999996s)]
*  Really shows that as Jeremy said there's a significant weakness in their security apparatus [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=444.02s)]
*  And they you know they really didn't didn't take care of things all right. Thank you very much [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=450.5s)]
*  Colonel and Jeremy for that incredible and significant reporting on that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=456.34s)]
*  assassination [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12_YTNLq3NY&t=460.46s)]
