# Gunfire breaks out at key Gaza crossing for aid trucks
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0)
*  Well, this video is hard to look at, but what can you tell us about it? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=0.0s)]
*  I know there's not a whole lot of information, but it gets to the desperation that we're [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  seeing out there. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=10.38s)]
*  Well, this location in southern Gaza, the Rafah Crossing, is essentially one of the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  only lifelines for the 2.2 million people in Gaza because it's where you can bring [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=17.6s)]
*  in supplies from Egypt. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=22.12s)]
*  There's always a long line of trucks waiting to cross, but they don't always get through. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=24.16s)]
*  We know that there were dozens of trucks that did get through, but their efforts to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=29.28s)]
*  distribute aid in Gaza were hampered by these large, desperate crowds. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=34.36s)]
*  You're talking about hundreds of people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=39.16s)]
*  At least that's what we can ascertain from this footage. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=41.16s)]
*  Jumping on the trucks, trying to break in and grab whatever items they could. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=44.4s)]
*  It seemed as if it was really a mad dash, and at some point, gunfire erupts. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=48.64s)]
*  So adding to the chaos and the confusion is the danger of bullets whizzing through the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=53.32s)]
*  air. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  We don't know who was firing the shots. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  We don't know how it started or necessarily why, but in a chaotic situation like that, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=59.36s)]
*  when people are so hungry and so desperate and so determined to try to get what they [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=65.4s)]
*  can in many cases just to support themselves and their families, but there could also be [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=71.0s)]
*  potentially looting. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=76.18s)]
*  We saw that there were tires that were set on fire, and then you had the gunshots ring [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  out as well. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=80.94s)]
*  Listen to what it sounded like at the height of all of this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=82.08s)]
*  It is Christmas Eve, Jen. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=87.76s)]
*  These people have lived through week after week of airstrikes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=113.66s)]
*  There's been ground combat that's now expanding. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=118.3s)]
*  The IDF, the Israeli military, moving into central and southern Gaza, their operations. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=121.1s)]
*  There have been airstrikes throughout all of these areas. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=125.66s)]
*  And now on top of that, a brawl around the relief trucks and gunfire. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  People are living an absolute hellish nightmare right now in Gaza, and this video is all you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=133.18s)]
*  really need to look at to just get a little bit of a glimpse of what it's like for them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=140.38s)]
*  And this is why the call for aid, the call for help, the call to do whatever the world [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=145.5s)]
*  can to improve the situation for more than 2 million people living through this is even [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=151.22s)]
*  more urgent on this Christmas Eve than it's ever been. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=156.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=159.38s)]
*  Well, that video right there just goes to the horror of what life is like right now [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=160.38s)]
*  in that part of the world. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=166.26s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=169.02s)]
*  The gunfire is emanating in that video. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=170.9s)]
*  Is that something we can ascertain from looking at it? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=175.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=177.14s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=178.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=179.14s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=180.14s)]
*  It's in the video, but we don't know where the shots are being fired from. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=181.14s)]
*  You don't see, there's no reports of anybody injured that we know of. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=184.26s)]
*  But again, information can be slow going. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=188.18s)]
*  A lot of times people have to climb up on a roof just to get an internet signal to feed [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=190.62s)]
*  back video like this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=194.34s)]
*  Our journalists on the ground in Gaza work so hard to record moments and sometimes it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=196.42s)]
*  can take hours and hours and hours just to get the information back to us, to get a phone [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=201.42s)]
*  signal to get the footage back. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=205.45999999999998s)]
*  And so we hope to learn more about what exactly happened today in southern Gaza at the Rafah [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  crossing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=211.42s)]
*  But you can see clearly in the pictures, it was a situation of people who are driven to [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=212.5s)]
*  the edge of desperation. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=218.54s)]
*  And so determined to try to get what they can, grabbing whatever they can, running for [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=222.38s)]
*  it and then having to essentially hear gunfire, wonder if they're going to have to dodge bullets [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=228.82s)]
*  after airstrikes and everything else that they've gone through. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=233.62s)]
*  And by the way, most of these people on the verge of starvation, extremely hungry because [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=236.5s)]
*  there's so little food and water, even drinking water available in Gaza right now. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  Barack, I do want to ask you about this drone attack in just a few moments, but I wanted [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=246.06s)]
*  to go back to that video that Will Ripley was talking about near the Rafah border crossing [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=250.38s)]
*  where we saw gunfire breaking out, people sort of almost running in a panic with relief [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=254.98s)]
*  supplies that had come in. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=260.42s)]
*  I guess what's your sense when you talk to your sources about the level of desperation [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  inside Gaza and whether things could, I mean, this just gives you a sense that things could [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=269.14s)]
*  really spiral out of control in a significant way that it just might become difficult for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=273.94s)]
*  anybody to get a handle or a lid on the situation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=280.5s)]
*  What's your sense of it? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=283.98s)]
*  First, I agree with you, Jim, that the situation is very, very serious and it's getting worse [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  by the day. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=292.82s)]
*  And I think what is most challenging is that in a few weeks, the Israeli military is going [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=294.28000000000003s)]
*  to phase out this operation, move from the high intensity phase to the low intensity [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=301.22s)]
*  phase, which means that most of the IDF soldiers will go out of the Palestinian cities. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=306.82000000000005s)]
*  And then you'll have a vacuum all over the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=313.82000000000005s)]
*  And then either Hamas will come back again or we will see the same pictures we saw in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=318.16s)]
*  Rafah today, we'll see it all over the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=323.1s)]
*  And the number one challenge now is to find a way for somebody to be in charge of law [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=326.68s)]
*  and order in a few weeks in Gaza so that all this humanitarian aid that is coming in won't [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=333.94s)]
*  be looted, will reach the people who need it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  And unfortunately, at that moment, there's nobody that can do it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=342.14s)]
*  Right, because, Barack, one of the conversations that really hasn't been fully dealt with is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=346.4s)]
*  Who is going to be the governing authority in Gaza in the near future? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=353.12s)]
*  I can't imagine Israel is going to want Hamas to be that governing authority. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=360.71999999999997s)]
*  And when you see the chaos break out that we saw today, I mean, that is going to be [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=364.91999999999996s)]
*  a major challenge. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=369.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=371.84s)]
*  And if it's not Hamas, and if there's no other volunteer that can take the Gaza Strip [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=372.84s)]
*  under its responsibility, the Egyptians are not going to do it, the Saudis are not going [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=382.48s)]
*  to do it, the Emiratis are not going to do it, then Israel can find itself. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=386.24s)]
*  Again, not next year and not six months from now, but a few weeks from now in a situation [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=390.32s)]
*  where it will have to take responsibility for two million Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=397.36s)]
*  And this is the last thing Israel wants. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=404.88s)]
*  But if there's not going to be any alternative governing body, and for now there is not, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=407.4s)]
*  the responsibility will lie at Israel's table. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=412.76s)]
*  And Barak, what do you make of the Pentagon singling out Iran for this latest drone attack [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  on this commercial ship? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=423.0s)]
*  It does sound as though the tensions are really building and it almost feels like a foreshadowing [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=424.68s)]
*  of something to come to send a message to the Houthi rebels, to send a message to the [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=431.68s)]
*  Iranians potentially. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=436.88s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=438.24s)]
*  I think what's important and interesting in this recent attack that generated from Iran, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=440.76s)]
*  this drone attack against this ship near the coast of India, is that it's a kind of attack [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=447.88s)]
*  that we haven't seen for many, many months. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=453.2s)]
*  Something like a year ago, we saw almost every week an Iranian attack on some sort of a vessel [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=456.24s)]
*  that had either a strong connection or a weak connection to Israel. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=463.24s)]
*  And this was part of this shadow war between Israel and Iran because the Israelis also [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=467.56s)]
*  attacked Iranian vessels and this was this tit for tat. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=472.52s)]
*  But we haven't seen this for a long, long time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=476.28000000000003s)]
*  And the fact that the Iranians decided to resume those attacks, those direct attacks [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=478.32s)]
*  from Iran against Israeli vessels or vessels that are affiliated with Israeli companies, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=483.56s)]
*  I think it's a very worrisome sign because it's no doubt an escalation after what we've [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=489.32s)]
*  seen in the last few weeks. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=495.08s)]
*  And when we were talking with Kevin Liptak earlier about this on this program, I mean, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=497.16s)]
*  there is a sense in the Biden administration that the Iranians may be setting something [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=501.0s)]
*  of a bit of a trap and that they want to almost bait the Israelis in the U.S. to, I guess, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=505.32000000000005s)]
*  muster some kind of response that would widen the conflict, make things messier in the region. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=511.12s)]
*  I suppose that there's that side of it too that has to be dealt with. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=516.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=520.76s)]
*  So senior Israeli officials that I talked to are, you know, very aware that that's the [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=521.84s)]
*  case and this is why you did not see Israel retaliating against the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=526.76s)]
*  Because the Israelis say this is exactly what the Iranians and the Houthis want. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=533.44s)]
*  They want to distract us from Gaza. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=537.24s)]
*  They want to distract us from trying to deter Hezbollah in the north. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=539.44s)]
*  And we're not going to do it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  And therefore Israel gives a chance for this international maritime coalition in the Red [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl1Qj7ev3t0&t=545.14s)]
