# 'Mind-boggling': Retired general on Hamas tunnel in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [December 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg)
*  I guess first of all, I mean, the images of this tunnel are just kind of mind boggling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=0.0s)]
*  here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  What is your take on all this? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  What was your reaction to that when you saw that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=8.88s)]
*  Yeah, Jim, my reaction is this is what Israel has been talking about since the beginning [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=11.24s)]
*  of this conflict. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=16.96s)]
*  They knew that these kind of tunnels existed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=18.28s)]
*  I mean, we've been showing on CNN the single file tunnels that you almost have to squeeze [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=20.52s)]
*  through. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=25.32s)]
*  You're not going to conduct an operation of literally thousands of terrorists when you're [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=26.32s)]
*  squeezing them all through. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=31.12s)]
*  So you're talking about a tunnel in this case that's 50 meters, about 200 feet or so underground, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=32.76s)]
*  that has the capability to hold weapons, have large meeting spaces, travel around and even [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=38.66s)]
*  bring vehicles in. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=44.32s)]
*  It's just part of the network that's subterranean under the Gaza that Hamas has been building [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=45.32s)]
*  for the last several years, in fact, close to a decade, and how they have been shifting [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=51.68s)]
*  the money away from the Palestinian citizens to build these kind of things, to construct [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=56.44s)]
*  their military apparatus. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=63.2s)]
*  And it's just mind boggling. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=64.76s)]
*  It is, but it also shows the difficulty of fighting in this kind of subterranean environment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=67.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, our Jeremy Diamond was saying just a short while ago that, I mean, this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=72.2s)]
*  tunnel is almost big enough or maybe big enough for vehicles to move through. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=77.92s)]
*  I mean, that is a different kind of tunnel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=81.28s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=84.92s)]
*  In general, today the IDF announced it's taken control of parts of Khan Yunis in southern [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=86.88s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=91.16s)]
*  The Hamas-run health ministry also reported an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=92.16s)]
*  What's your sense of things right now? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=98.56s)]
*  I mean, President Biden has been concerned about what he's described as indiscriminate [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=99.76s)]
*  bombing in Gaza. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=104.88s)]
*  But what's your sense of where things stand right now tonight? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  I'm not in concurrence, Jim, with the indiscriminate bombing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=113.6s)]
*  It may be somewhat excessive, and we could talk about that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=120.16s)]
*  But from the very beginning of this conflict, starting eight weeks ago, you and I were talking [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=124.28s)]
*  about how they would start in northern Gaza, in Gaza City, and then go to potentially Khan [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=128.84s)]
*  Yunis, then to Dara Bala, and then even down south into Ra'afah. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli government has said this operation will take many more months, whereas many of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=139.64s)]
*  the United States administration is saying they'd like to see it ended in terms of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  kinetic operation by the end of December. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=149.12s)]
*  I've said from the beginning, I don't think that's going to happen given the size and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=151.72s)]
*  strength of the Hamas terrorist groups that are in these subterranean tunnels. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  And we're seeing in each section of Gaza that there are more and more underground headquarters, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=160.48s)]
*  and Hamas has been very diligent in terms of setting traps for the Israeli forces as [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=165.28s)]
*  they go through. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=170.32s)]
*  So anyone that says, hey, we ought to shift from using air power to ground and special [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=171.32s)]
*  operations forces, that's easy to say on the outside. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  But truthfully, with some of the constructs that we've seen Hamas using, these underground [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=180.48s)]
*  networks and some of the uses of civilian buildings have to be struck. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=186.56s)]
*  I think it will continue on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  Secretary Austin is going to discuss that with the Israeli government over the next [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=194.28s)]
*  couple of days. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  But I think we're going to see a continuation of these kind of strikes until Israel determines [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  that Hamas is defeated. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=204.52s)]
*  And I did want to ask you about the three Israeli hostages who were mistakenly killed [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  by the IDF. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  We've talked to a variety of people this weekend. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=212.76000000000002s)]
*  I certainly want to get your take on all of this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=214.84s)]
*  When I spoke with the IDF spokesman, Jonathan Konrickis, yesterday, I mean, he really didn't [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=217.52s)]
*  indicate that there's going to be a major shift in their tactics or rules of engagement. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=224.16s)]
*  They're going to remind their soldiers that they may come across hostages from time to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=229.68s)]
*  time who have escaped captivity, and they need to be able to recognize that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=233.44s)]
*  But I mean, the three men came out of a building shirtless, waving a white flag. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  They were shot anyway. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=243.38s)]
*  The IDF says those troops were not following the proper rules of engagement. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  But Colonel Konrickis was saying, look, you know, we have Hamas fighters who are pretending [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=250.78s)]
*  to be civilians, who are doing things to draw in IDF forces to entrap them and kill them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=255.62s)]
*  It is such a messy, chaotic battlefield. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=262.44s)]
*  I'm wondering, General, what's your advice in all this? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=264.78s)]
*  Well, I don't have any advice, Jim. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  But truthfully, what I would say is Hamas and any terrorist organization is going to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=270.38s)]
*  use deception and trickery. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=275.14s)]
*  And you add to that the fact of the conditions of the battlefield, as you just said, and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=278.06s)]
*  I would bet that the hostages, as they came out of the building, probably did not look [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=282.46s)]
*  like the clean-cut young men we see in their photos that have been appearing on air. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=287.14s)]
*  They've been in captivity for two months. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=292.5s)]
*  The Israeli soldiers who were always anxious in any kind of firefight with adrenaline surging, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=296.94s)]
*  and especially depending on what their level of training experience is. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=302.98s)]
*  You know, truthfully, Jim, I had a fratricide incident in a command I was in in Iraq. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=307.18s)]
*  And it devastates the individuals who shoot their fellow citizens. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=313.82s)]
*  And in this case, I'm sure it's not only devastated whoever engaged those three hostages, but [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=318.86s)]
*  I would believe that this is rippled through the Israeli Defense Forces. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=324.70000000000005s)]
*  And they are attempting to conduct their operations according to rules of engagement. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=329.26000000000005s)]
*  But truthfully, as you just said, the conditions on this battlefield are extremely complex [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=334.66s)]
*  and complicated. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=340.26000000000005s)]
*  You don't know who the enemy is. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=341.70000000000005s)]
*  When people hop out of buildings, especially buildings, as the Israelis have been showing, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=343.66s)]
*  contain a vast amount of ammunition and they contain ambush sites, it's very difficult [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=348.78000000000003s)]
*  to differentiate. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=353.78s)]
*  But I believe that the Israeli Defense Forces will review their rules of engagement. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=354.78s)]
*  And I know their chief of staff has addressed this issue with all of their soldiers in the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=360.05999999999995s)]
*  fight right now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=364.05999999999995s)]
*  But it's tough. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=365.05999999999995s)]
*  It's really heartbreaking. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=366.05999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, very heartbreaking. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=367.05999999999995s)]
*  All right, General Hurling, great to have you on as always. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=369.21999999999997s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQ7zYQlPyg&t=372.26s)]
