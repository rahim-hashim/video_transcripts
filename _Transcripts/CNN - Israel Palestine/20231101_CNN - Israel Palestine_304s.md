# CNN anchor asks IDF spokesman where Palestinians were supposed to go after strike. Hear his response
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo)
*  Colonel, I appreciate your time, again, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=0.0s)]
*  obviously in these early hours of the morning for you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=2.2s)]
*  You heard that man there, you know, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=5.84s)]
*  asking the question about his family who are dead. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=7.8s)]
*  What did they do to deserve this? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=10.84s)]
*  What is your reaction, Colonel, to these accusations [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  that you hear, that the strikes on the Javaleo refugee camp [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  are hitting civilians and amount to a massacre by the IDF? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=19.72s)]
*  Hi, Erin. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=25.22s)]
*  Sad images, really, at the human level. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=26.72s)]
*  When I watch it and I detach myself [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=29.58s)]
*  from the reality that we are facing, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=31.619999999999997s)]
*  I see sad events and I see people suffering, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=34.22s)]
*  and that is not something that we intend to. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=37.42s)]
*  What I could say to that man, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=40.599999999999994s)]
*  without even a drop of cynicism, is, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  you should have evacuated you and your family. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=45.54s)]
*  You shouldn't have been there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=48.44s)]
*  That doesn't mean that we wanted to kill anybody. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=49.94s)]
*  It just means that when we warned Palestinians two weeks ago [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=53.1s)]
*  to evacuate that specific area [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=57.04s)]
*  because there was going to be major combat operations, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=59.64s)]
*  they should have heeded the warning and they should have left. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=62.64s)]
*  The sad reality that is unfolding now [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=65.88s)]
*  is that the civilians in Gaza [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=68.52s)]
*  are paying the price for the atrocities of Hamas. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=70.68s)]
*  We are fighting a battle here to defend ourselves. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=74.28s)]
*  We cannot allow a situation for Hamas to continue to exist [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=76.68s)]
*  after the atrocities of October 7th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=81.38s)]
*  And in order for us to be able to safeguard ourselves, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=84.28s)]
*  we have to eradicate Hamas wherever they are, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=86.92s)]
*  even if they're hiding in tunnels underneath populated areas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=90.02s)]
*  Colonel Kamikis, so the point, though, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=95.02s)]
*  about wanting them to leave, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=96.82s)]
*  I mean, these are 100,000 people in a refugee camp. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=98.06s)]
*  By definition, they lack resources. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=101.0s)]
*  Where were people like that supposed to go? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=104.26s)]
*  Was it even reasonable to tell them to go? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=106.3s)]
*  I mean, they don't have anything to begin with. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=108.32s)]
*  No, no, that is unfortunately not accurate at all. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=111.02s)]
*  And if you'll let me, I'd like to explain why. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=114.56s)]
*  If you look at the footage that you're showing, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=117.16s)]
*  you don't see tents. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=119.26s)]
*  This isn't some makeshift refugee camp. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=120.3s)]
*  These are permanent dwellings of Palestinians [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=123.14s)]
*  living in a Palestinian-controlled area [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=126.6s)]
*  under Palestinian rule. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=129.44s)]
*  These aren't refugees. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=131.14s)]
*  No more than my grandparents are refugees [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=132.38s)]
*  who came from Poland and Morocco in 1948. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=135.16000000000003s)]
*  This is the time scope that we're talking about. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=138.5s)]
*  These aren't refugees, and it's not a refugee camp [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=140.9s)]
*  any more than half of the population in modern Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=143.68s)]
*  are refugees of the expulsion from Arab countries in 1948. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  So, yes, they could evacuate. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=151.18s)]
*  I understand your point about permanence. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure King Abdullah would say the same [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=154.96s)]
*  about refugee camps of Syrians in Jordan and Egypt, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=156.62s)]
*  the same about other refugee camps they have. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=161.02s)]
*  But while I understand the point you're making [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=163.22s)]
*  about the permanency of the residents, they are poor. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=165.72s)]
*  And they're ability to move, Erin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  Yes, they could, they could. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  They made a decision. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=172.61999999999998s)]
*  Now, the fact that they made the wrong decision [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=173.7s)]
*  does not make them a target. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=176.26s)]
*  That is not what I'm saying. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=177.64s)]
*  I am saying that we warned ahead. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=178.76s)]
*  Everybody in Jabalia knows the same guy [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=181.1s)]
*  who was holding the page listing the unfortunate deaths [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=183.6s)]
*  in his family, I feel for him, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  but he knows that Hamas is there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=188.73999999999998s)]
*  He knows that the place is full [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=190.9s)]
*  of what they call Mukawamah, resistance. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=193.1s)]
*  All of them know it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=195.4s)]
*  And they know that there will be fighting there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=196.68s)]
*  And they know that the safest place for them to be [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=198.48s)]
*  is not there, it's in the South. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=200.88s)]
*  So let me ask you a question about though, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=203.38s)]
*  how you know what you're striking, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=205.7s)]
*  because I know you put out a statement today, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  the IDF did at least, Colonel, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=210.1s)]
*  regarding the second strike, right? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=211.98s)]
*  The second strike in 24 hours in Jabalia camp. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=213.54s)]
*  And a quote from it is that, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=215.82s)]
*  based on precise intelligence, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=217.42s)]
*  IDF fighter jets struck Hamas command [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=219.06s)]
*  and control complex in Jabalia. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=221.29999999999998s)]
*  Colonel, of course, we all know Israeli intelligence failed [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  in the lead up to the Hamas terror attack on October 7th. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=228.98s)]
*  How do you know that Israeli intelligence is right now? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=232.5s)]
*  Aaron, I think you asked the same question three weeks ago, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=238.26s)]
*  and I think I'll provide the same answer [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=241.22s)]
*  that I'm saying now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=243.5s)]
*  We are basing our military operations off intelligence. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=244.7s)]
*  We continue to monitor their communications. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=247.89999999999998s)]
*  We continue to listen and see what they're doing. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=250.61999999999998s)]
*  We issue information, not claims, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=253.5s)]
*  but we issue names, faces, and positions [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=256.18s)]
*  of dead Hamas commanders and key operatives. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=259.14s)]
*  We do that because we do still have excellent intelligence, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=262.94s)]
*  very granular intelligence of what they are doing [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=267.06s)]
*  of their whereabouts. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=269.62s)]
*  Granted, I cannot argue with what you said, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=270.86s)]
*  the first part, yes, we failed on October 7th, clearly, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=273.94s)]
*  and that needs to be investigated, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=278.14s)]
*  but definitely that does not imply [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=279.7s)]
*  that our intelligence is wrong. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=282.42s)]
*  On the contrary, we continue working [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=284.1s)]
*  based on that intelligence, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=286.46s)]
*  and we generate more intelligence. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=287.7s)]
*  Our ground troops are there in friction with the enemy. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=289.58s)]
*  Every encounter, when we meet the enemy, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=292.82s)]
*  we defeat them, even if we have casualties, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=295.26s)]
*  and then we generate more and more targeting intelligence. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=297.58s)]
*  All right, well, Colonel Konriks, thank you very much. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=300.9s)]
*  I appreciate your time tonight. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5fBPAKpaKo&t=302.8s)]
