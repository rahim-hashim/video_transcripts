# Retired colonel predicts Israelâ€™s next steps in war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU)
*  analyst Colonel Cedric Layton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=0.0s)]
*  Colonel, thank you so much for [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=1.8s)]
*  your time this morning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=3.72s)]
*  First up, I want to get your reaction [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=4.96s)]
*  to Secretary of State Blinken in Ramallah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=7.48s)]
*  He was just there meeting with Mahmoud [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=9.8s)]
*  Abbas, the Palestinian authorities [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=11.88s)]
*  president. What does that tell you? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=13.32s)]
*  Especially that he's engaging [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=15.0s)]
*  once again in shuttle diplomacy. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=16.28s)]
*  He was just at the summit in Saturday [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=17.96s)]
*  meeting with the four ministers of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=20.48s)]
*  Egypt and Qatar and Jordan. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=22.6s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=24.2s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, Amara. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=27.0s)]
*  Well, I think what Secretary Blinken [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=28.52s)]
*  is doing is he's trying to shore up [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=30.56s)]
*  support among the Palestinian authority [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=33.24s)]
*  as well as the Arab nations for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=35.24s)]
*  a two state solution. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=37.84s)]
*  He would like the Palestinian authority [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=39.4s)]
*  also to take over the administration [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=41.72s)]
*  of Gaza once Israel achieves its [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=43.96s)]
*  goals of destroying Hamas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=46.28s)]
*  Now, whether or not Israel can achieve [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=47.84s)]
*  those goals is of course another matter, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=50.0s)]
*  but I think the goal of the Secretary [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  of State is very much to get the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=55.12s)]
*  Palestinian Authority represented [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=58.08s)]
*  by Mahmoud Abbas in on his side and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=59.64s)]
*  make that work for him from a political [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=63.04s)]
*  standpoint. What are your thoughts [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=66.6s)]
*  on this four hour window for this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=68.96s)]
*  safe corridor that window is about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=72.0s)]
*  to close at 2 PM local time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=74.36s)]
*  It's a little after 1 o'clock there [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=77.16s)]
*  and and Elia brought up these issues, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=79.6s)]
*  right? I mean, how do you even get [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=82.75999999999999s)]
*  those to all the civilians who were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=84.84s)]
*  dealing with power outages and Internet [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=87.08s)]
*  outages in Gaza and let's say they do [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=89.16s)]
*  get the message? Of course, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=91.84s)]
*  resources is a huge problem, right? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=93.56s)]
*  Because no fuel, as we heard from the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  US special envoy David Satterfield, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=98.12s)]
*  no new fuel has gone into Gaza [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=99.92s)]
*  since the war began. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=102.36s)]
*  How helpful do you think this [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=103.72s)]
*  quote unquote safe corridor that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  the IDF is opening will be for [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  the civilians to move South? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=110.12s)]
*  I think it's too short a time period. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=111.8s)]
*  You know, four hours is not enough [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=114.84s)]
*  time to get people out, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=117.36s)]
*  especially those that have, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=119.28s)]
*  you know that have special needs or are [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=120.72s)]
*  in a place where they can't really [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=123.36s)]
*  get transportation. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=125.96s)]
*  I so far to my knowledge, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=126.92s)]
*  at least we have not seen a stream [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=129.12s)]
*  of refugees on foot marching down. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=131.88s)]
*  You know the Saladin Highway there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=134.12s)]
*  So you know, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=136.32s)]
*  Elliot's absolutely right. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=137.36s)]
*  You know, if you don't have any [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=138.4s)]
*  Internet connectivity, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=140.76s)]
*  if you don't have power, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=141.72s)]
*  there is a risk that you might [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  not get that message. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=145.64s)]
*  The Israelis have in the past [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=147.04s)]
*  distributed flyers. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=149.32s)]
*  They've airdropped flyers into the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=150.28s)]
*  Palestinian areas to get them that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  kind of a message, whether or not [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=154.67999999999998s)]
*  they did that in this case. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=157.04s)]
*  I'm not sure, but they're definitely. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  The Israelis are definitely trying [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=161.16s)]
*  several ways to get the message to them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  The problem that they have is it's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=165.72s)]
*  not coordinated with other aspects [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=168.04s)]
*  of their military operation, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=169.8s)]
*  or doesn't seem to be at least. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=171.32000000000002s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of AIDS [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=173.88000000000002s)]
*  still at the border that needs to get in. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  Of course, we're still talking about [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=178.24s)]
*  hostages that the US and Israel are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=180.28s)]
*  quite involved in trying to get released, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=182.68s)]
*  but there's also what seems to be a [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=185.16000000000003s)]
*  public split that's forming between [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=187.52s)]
*  the US and Israel. Is that how you see it? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  Because you have Netanyahu who is saying [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=192.24s)]
*  there will no be there will not be any [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=194.4s)]
*  kind of ceasefire or a police operation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  Or a pause until all hostages are released. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=199.28s)]
*  But then you also have the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=202.68s)]
*  Secretary of State Blinken, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=204.44s)]
*  who is publicly stating there [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=205.72s)]
*  needs to be a humanitarian pause. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=207.52s)]
*  Yeah, the Secretary of State is trying [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=211.68s)]
*  to very much to bridge the gap between [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=214.04s)]
*  the desire for a complete ceasefire [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=217.04s)]
*  and Israel's stand public stance, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=219.36s)]
*  at least on the issue of either [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=221.72s)]
*  a ceasefire or humanitarian pause. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=224.28s)]
*  I didn't fact they are doing some [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=226.2s)]
*  humanitarian pauses like the one [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=228.8s)]
*  that's in existence right now, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=230.88000000000002s)]
*  but the fact of the matter is that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Israel has its war aims and it believes [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=235.4s)]
*  it can't be seen to be deviating from them. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=238.36s)]
*  And they think that this kind of a [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=241.52s)]
*  humanitarian pause may be a slight [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=243.84s)]
*  deviation or a large deviation in their [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=245.68s)]
*  minds perhaps from their war aims. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=247.68s)]
*  So the Secretary has a bit of a problem [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=250.72000000000003s)]
*  here in the effort to kind of bridge that gap. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  It's a very difficult needle [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=256.84s)]
*  to thread in this case. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=258.44s)]
*  So what's your sense? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  Colonel? What's happening on the ground? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=261.0s)]
*  Last we heard was on Friday that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  Israel had encircled Gaza City. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=264.84s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=267.08s)]
*  Yes, I'm not sure that the encirclement [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=269.88s)]
*  has been completed yet, but it may [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  have been by this time, but you know, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=275.15999999999997s)]
*  the encirclement is designed to in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  essence either besiege or starve out. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=280.08s)]
*  The Hamas fighters now when they do [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  that and we see the map of Gaza right [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=286.12s)]
*  there in Gaza City in particular, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=288.8s)]
*  that's kind of in the center of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=290.88s)]
*  And the idea there is not only to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=293.2s)]
*  encircle that area, but also to make it [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=295.52s)]
*  possible for Israeli ground forces to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  enter a certain zone within that city [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=301.08s)]
*  and then be able to go in and in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=304.0s)]
*  essence clear that zone. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=305.72s)]
*  And that's going to be difficult [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  for the Israelis to do. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=308.2s)]
*  I think that might be the next step, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=309.48s)]
*  but they're going to have to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4Iv6W0dOhU&t=311.8s)]
