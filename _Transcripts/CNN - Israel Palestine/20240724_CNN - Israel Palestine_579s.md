# Bernie Sanders rips Netanyahu ahead of high-stakes speech to Congress
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=0.0s)]
*  will address a joint meeting of Congress. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=2.0s)]
*  Ahead of his speech, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=4.4s)]
*  hundreds of protesters stages sit [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=5.8s)]
*  in inside the Capitol calling [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=7.46s)]
*  for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Dozens of Democratic lawmakers [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=10.78s)]
*  are planning to skip the speech [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=12.24s)]
*  as the party remains divided [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  over his handling of the war. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=15.8s)]
*  See it ends. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=17.88s)]
*  Lauren Fox is with me now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=18.88s)]
*  What do we expect today, Lauren? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=20.6s)]
*  Yeah, this address is coming at [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=22.88s)]
*  such a tumultuous time and not [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=24.76s)]
*  just US politics but also Israeli [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=26.68s)]
*  politics and as Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=28.76s)]
*  faces challenges back home, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=31.0s)]
*  this is a high stakes speech for him, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=32.64s)]
*  given the fact that there are lawmakers [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=35.44s)]
*  who are going to be in this audience [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=37.800000000000004s)]
*  who have serious questions, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=40.52s)]
*  serious doubts about Netanyahu's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=42.040000000000006s)]
*  leadership right now, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=43.64s)]
*  and that includes some Republicans. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  I was talking last night to Senator [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=46.72s)]
*  Joni Ernst. She serves on the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=49.2s)]
*  Armed Services Committee and she said [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=51.52s)]
*  she has to hear a very clear and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=53.8s)]
*  concise message from Netanyahu [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=56.660000000000004s)]
*  today about the path forward in this [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=58.46s)]
*  war and how he is going to get hostages [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=61.1s)]
*  home. She said it is far beyond [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=64.1s)]
*  time for that to happen, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=66.42s)]
*  but you are also going to see many [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=68.14s)]
*  Democrats not attending this speech today. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=70.62s)]
*  There are more than 80 House Democrats [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=72.98s)]
*  who we know are going to be boycotting [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=75.38s)]
*  six US senators who are going to be [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=78.18s)]
*  boycotting including Patty Murray, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=80.98s)]
*  who is a top Democrat in leadership, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=82.66s)]
*  who is not going to be attending [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=85.34s)]
*  this speech today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Overseeing it is going to be Senator Ben [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=88.62s)]
*  Cardin. He's going to be presiding, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=91.14s)]
*  and I think that that just says a lot [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=93.28s)]
*  about this moment right now as Netanyahu [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=95.88s)]
*  comes in to give this address. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  You know, there are some Democrats who [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=100.28s)]
*  are going to be having alternative [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=102.44s)]
*  programming. This is Congresswoman [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  Pramila Jayapal, who said in a statement, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  instead of attending Benjamin [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=108.08s)]
*  Netanyahu's address, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=109.52s)]
*  I will attend a panel discussion led [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=110.32s)]
*  by the Center of American Progress and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=112.72s)]
*  other organizations on the path to peace. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=115.48s)]
*  This event will feature a Palestinian leader, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=118.2s)]
*  a Jewish Israeli leader, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=120.98s)]
*  and a former IDF soldier, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=122.48s)]
*  all of whom are dedicated to finding [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=124.44s)]
*  a path toward peace and security. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=126.98s)]
*  And I just want to remind people that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=130.08s)]
*  this address is happening after the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  initial invitation went out from [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=134.72s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson. Obviously, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  it's going to be really interesting to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=138.68s)]
*  see what House Republicans think of this [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  speech. Meanwhile, last night on the Senate [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=142.68s)]
*  a series of Democrats. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=144.88s)]
*  Address the issues that they see happening [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=146.72s)]
*  and concerns that they have about [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu coming. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=151.24s)]
*  This is independent Senator Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=152.48s)]
*  It will be the first time in [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=157.56s)]
*  American history that a war criminal [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=160.92s)]
*  has been given that honor. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Frankly, this invitation to Netanyahu [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=167.12s)]
*  is a disgrace and something that we [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=170.48s)]
*  will look back on with regret. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=174.28s)]
*  And earlier this year, remember, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=179.56s)]
*  majority leader Chuck Schumer actually [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=181.48s)]
*  called on the Israeli people to hold a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=183.28s)]
*  new election and replace Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=185.88s)]
*  Lauren Fox in Washington will [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=188.28s)]
*  be watching this very closely. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=190.0s)]
*  Lauren, thank you very much. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=191.8s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=193.48s)]
*  will address the US Congress for a record [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=195.44s)]
*  fourth time now he hopes to shore up [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=198.32s)]
*  American support for the war in Gaza, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=200.8s)]
*  but Israeli hostages still held in Gaza [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=203.28s)]
*  are criticizing his trip with some saying [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=205.24s)]
*  he should have remained at home to secure [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=207.44s)]
*  a deal to release the hostages. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=209.44s)]
*  Now his trip comes amid an upheaval [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=211.44s)]
*  in US politics, though his visit was [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  orchestrated by Republican leaders. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=215.84s)]
*  Many prominent Democrats like Vice President [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=217.56s)]
*  Harrison, Senator Elizabeth Warren, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=219.64s)]
*  won't be in attendance for his speech. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=221.6s)]
*  I'm not going because Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=225.0s)]
*  has led that region into a complete humanitarian disaster. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=229.72s)]
*  He has put his own personal interests [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=235.72s)]
*  ahead of the interests of the people of his country. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=238.16s)]
*  And what he has done in Gaza is unspeakable. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=242.04s)]
*  Now Prime Minister Netanyahu is scheduled [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=246.96s)]
*  to meet President Biden on Thursday [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=249.2s)]
*  and former President Trump on Friday. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=251.2s)]
*  CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live from London. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=253.6s)]
*  So Nada, what can you tell us about the upcoming speech [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=256.72s)]
*  and what Netanyahu here expects to achieve? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=259.12s)]
*  Look, Omar, there is growing pressure from representatives [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=262.84s)]
*  and family members of those hostages still held captive [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=265.88s)]
*  by Hamas in Gaza for Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=268.91999999999996s)]
*  to strike a deal. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=272.79999999999995s)]
*  They want that to be the focus of his address to Congress. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  In fact, we've heard from the Hostage Trans Forum, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=276.67999999999995s)]
*  which has said they want to see Netanyahu [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  opening his address by saying there is a deal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=281.32s)]
*  And we have heard some optimistic notes [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  from the Israeli Prime Minister. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=286.52s)]
*  We've even heard some signs of optimism [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=287.8s)]
*  from US officials as well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  It's understood that there is a clear framework [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=291.84s)]
*  on the deal that they're just hammering out [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=294.08s)]
*  those finer details and technicalities. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=295.64s)]
*  But as you mentioned, there is growing criticism [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=298.0s)]
*  of the Israeli Prime Minister back home in Israel [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=300.2s)]
*  and from the family members and representatives [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=302.52s)]
*  of those hostages still held captive, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=304.76s)]
*  saying that he should be at home focusing [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=306.68s)]
*  on the return of those hostages, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  bringing an end to the war in Gaza, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=310.76s)]
*  securing that ceasefire agreement. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=312.76s)]
*  Now, of course, all eyes will be on his address. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=314.92s)]
*  And as you mentioned, we are already seeing backlash [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=317.48s)]
*  in Washington, DC. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  Not only members of the Democrat Party [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=321.76s)]
*  now choosing to boycott, to not attend [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=324.08000000000004s)]
*  the congressional address by the Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=326.76s)]
*  but we're also seeing protests as well. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  Of course, we saw protests yesterday, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=331.68s)]
*  members of the Jewish Voice for Peace Movement [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=333.6s)]
*  occupying and staging a sit-in in congressional buildings. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  We've also seen, of course, other protests [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=339.56s)]
*  taking place across the country [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=341.44s)]
*  and are expecting to see more today. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=342.8s)]
*  But of course, that growing backlash [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=345.44s)]
*  is not only centered in Israel and in Washington. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=347.12s)]
*  It is global backlash. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=349.84s)]
*  And of course, the U.S. has been vocal [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=351.76s)]
*  in pushing the Israeli government [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=354.15999999999997s)]
*  for a ceasefire deal to be struck. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  Now, at this stage, we've heard from President Biden [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=358.88s)]
*  speaking on Monday. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=360.96s)]
*  He believes that the parties involved in this negotiation [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=362.56s)]
*  are, in his words, on the verge [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=366.12s)]
*  of coming to some sort of agreement. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=367.88s)]
*  The State Department has said that the gap [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=370.0s)]
*  separating those two is narrowing, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=372.28s)]
*  though there are still some issues which remain. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=374.04s)]
*  But of course, pressure is mounting. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=377.24s)]
*  And of course, the situation in Gaza [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=379.92s)]
*  is only worsening as well. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=381.76s)]
*  If a deal isn't struck soon, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=383.48s)]
*  we will be entering 10 months of this war. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=385.48s)]
*  That is 10 months with hostages still held captive in Hamas. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=388.6s)]
*  That is 10 months with civilians in Gaza being killed [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=392.16s)]
*  on a near daily basis. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=395.2s)]
*  That death toll now topping 39,000. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=397.16s)]
*  The UN warning that famine is spreading [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=399.72s)]
*  throughout the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=402.28s)]
*  But we are seeing the humanitarian situation [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=403.52000000000004s)]
*  worsen with our diseases [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=405.76s)]
*  spreading rapidly across the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  We're seeing continued airstrikes in southern Gaza as well. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=409.72s)]
*  Of course, deadly strikes in Khan Younis [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=412.68s)]
*  where hundreds, thousands even, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  civilians have been ordered to evacuate once again. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=416.6s)]
*  So it is a deteriorating situation. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  We're seeing mounting pressure from U.S. officials. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=421.68s)]
*  Many have been careful to clarify [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=425.32s)]
*  that the U.S. maintains its strong relationship with Israel, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  that Israel continues to be one of the United States [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=430.64000000000004s)]
*  closest and perhaps most important allies in the Middle East. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=433.36s)]
*  But again, we have seen those tensions mounting, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=437.04s)]
*  particularly between President Biden [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=439.68s)]
*  and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=442.08s)]
*  They are expected to meet, of course, on Thursday. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=444.59999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu now also expected to meet with Donald Trump, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=447.92s)]
*  formerly as president, and of course, also with Kamala Harris. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=451.03999999999996s)]
*  So important meetings taking place, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=454.2s)]
*  but all eyes will be on that congressional address later today. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=456.2s)]
*  Expectations around what he might say. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=459.8s)]
*  And of course, the reaction crucially from the Democrats as well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=461.36s)]
*  And all of the very real dynamics that you laid out, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=465.04s)]
*  particularly on the humanitarian front, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=467.84s)]
*  playing out in the politics of who will attend Netanyahu's address. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=469.36s)]
*  Shirley and Nada Bashir, thank you so much for the reporting. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=473.36s)]
*  Now, the head of the opposition Labor Party in Israel is blasting the trip. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=476.6s)]
*  Yair Golan posting on X saying, quote, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=480.52s)]
*  Netanyahu went to the U.S. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  for an extravagant show in the middle of the war without a deal to return hostages. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=484.64s)]
*  I want to bring in CNN Global Affairs analyst Mark Esper. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=490.11999999999995s)]
*  He was U.S. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=492.44s)]
*  defense secretary under President Trump. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=492.96s)]
*  Good to see you. Thanks for being here. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=495.32s)]
*  Now, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken says they're inside the 10 yard line, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=496.91999999999996s)]
*  driving toward the goal line and getting a ceasefire. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=500.76s)]
*  That's his metaphor, not mine, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=502.96s)]
*  but in getting a ceasefire and hostage agreement that would produce a ceasefire. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=504.35999999999996s)]
*  How optimistic are you of a deal getting done at this stage? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=509.23999999999995s)]
*  And what do you make of Netanyahu appearing before Congress without a finalized deal? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=512.64s)]
*  Right. Well, I was actually with Jake Sullivan and Tony Blinken this past weekend in Aspen, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=516.64s)]
*  and we talked about this and both believe or confident that we're within the 10 yard line, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=521.3199999999999s)]
*  as you said, but they also note that often those last 10 yards are the most difficult. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=526.1999999999999s)]
*  Look, I would say in some ways we've been here before. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=531.36s)]
*  There have been numerous proposals on the table for Hamas. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=533.36s)]
*  At the last minute, they've raised the ante with asking for adjustments and amendments and so forth. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=536.64s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=541.56s)]
*  I mean, there is hope that there will be some type of agreement [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=542.8s)]
*  but my view has been that Hamas is not going to be interested in any deal [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=545.2s)]
*  that does not call for a complete ceasefire and the removal of all Israeli troops from Gaza. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=550.2s)]
*  And I see the Israeli government, Netanyahu, unwilling to go there yet. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=555.5200000000001s)]
*  If you look, the polling shows that a majority of Israelis want to see no more Hamas in Gaza [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=559.72s)]
*  and they are very concerned about what might happen if Hamas is not dismantled. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=566.72s)]
*  So I think they're probably further apart than we would like, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=571.72s)]
*  but we'll see what happens in the coming days. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_0cXkyvTBg&t=575.3199999999999s)]
