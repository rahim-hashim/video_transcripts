*  Palestinian people are not disposable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=0.0s)]
*  We are human beings, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=18.0s)]
*  just like anyone else. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=22.0s)]
*  My city, my grandmother, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=24.0s)]
*  like all Palestinians, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=27.0s)]
*  just wants to live her life with freedom and human dignity we all deserve. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=29.0s)]
*  Speaking up to save lives, Mr. Chair, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=35.0s)]
*  no matter faith, no matter ethnicity, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=38.0s)]
*  should not be controversial in this chamber. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=40.0s)]
*  The cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=43.0s)]
*  Why? What I don't understand [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=48.0s)]
*  is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you all. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNeOV9kMof8&t=52.0s)]
