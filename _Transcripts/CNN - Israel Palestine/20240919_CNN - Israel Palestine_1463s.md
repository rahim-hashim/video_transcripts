# Inside the 'groundbreaking' pager and radio explosions targeting Hezbollah
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk)
*  But let's turn now to the other big story in our world lead and the two consecutive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=0.0s)]
*  days of attacks in Lebanon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=4.32s)]
*  Dozens of radios exploded earlier today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  They were carried by members of the Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorist group just one day after [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=8.44s)]
*  deadly blasts using thousands of the organization's pagers. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=12.48s)]
*  CNN's Ben Wiedemann is in the root and filed this report for us. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=15.84s)]
*  A funeral for those killed the day before is disrupted by another explosion. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  A wave of walkie talkie blasts across Lebanon killed more than a dozen and injured hundreds [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=28.12s)]
*  Wednesday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=34.04s)]
*  Coming barely 24 hours after hundreds of pagers blew up across the country at food markets [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=35.44s)]
*  and shops, killing at least 12 people including two children and injuring around 2,800 others. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=43.04s)]
*  And what CNN sources say was an attack by Israel's Mossad and military against Hezbollah [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=53.44s)]
*  unprecedented in its scale and nature. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=59.76s)]
*  Outside the American University of Beirut hospital distressed family members wait for [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=63.28s)]
*  updates on their loved ones. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=68.48s)]
*  Friends and relatives of the injured don't want to speak on camera, but off camera one [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=70.88s)]
*  told us for instance that a friend of his received a message on his pager. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=76.08s)]
*  He looked at it and the pager blew up in his face damaging his eyes and his fingers [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=81.88s)]
*  and in fact the chief medical officer here told us the majority of the injuries are to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  the eyes, to the hands and the hips where of course people were holding their pagers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  We received around 200 patients and we received them in a very short time about within an [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  hour or two almost all of them went inside our doors so this stretched us pretty much [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=104.08s)]
*  too thin. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=108.28s)]
*  A Lebanese security source says the militant group bought the devices that exploded in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=109.4s)]
*  recent months from a Taiwanese company Gold Apollo. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=114.76s)]
*  However Gold Apollo denies manufacturing the devices and says a distributor in Hungary [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=119.16s)]
*  is responsible. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=125.56s)]
*  A Taiwanese security official said there's no record the pagers were shipped to Lebanon [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=127.2s)]
*  or anywhere in the Middle East. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=132.36s)]
*  Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate, a message echoed by one of the group's lawmakers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  The resistance will continue, the support for Gaza will continue and the Israelis will [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=140.6s)]
*  regret what they have done. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=146.6s)]
*  The tension between Israel and Hezbollah is nothing new. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=149.28s)]
*  For most of the past year cross-border skirmishes have been common. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=152.48s)]
*  These device explosions represent a new level of escalation. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  On Wednesday Israel's defense minister said the explosions mark a new era in Israel's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=163.76s)]
*  war against Hezbollah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=169.64s)]
*  Worried citizens are now suspicious of everyday devices including one found in a parking lot [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=171.72s)]
*  near a busy hospital. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=177.92s)]
*  Security detonated it in a controlled explosion. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=180.48s)]
*  And Jake, CNN has learned that Israeli officials actually informed their American counterparts [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=184.04s)]
*  on Tuesday of an operation that they were going to conduct in Lebanon without actually [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=191.04s)]
*  providing the details of this unprecedented operation that of course left at least 2,800 [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=197.04s)]
*  people injured. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=205.04s)]
*  And this comes at a time when Secretary of State Anthony Fauci said that the Israeli [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=207.04s)]
*  is on his way back yet again to the Middle East to try to work out the possibility of [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=213.04s)]
*  some sort of progress in achieving a ceasefire. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=220.04s)]
*  Not the first time that Israel has conducted operations that have seriously complicated [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=224.04s)]
*  American diplomatic efforts in the region. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=231.04s)]
*  Jake? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=235.04s)]
*  Yeah, indeed. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=237.04s)]
*  I just spoke with some hostage families whose loved ones are being held by Hamas in Gaza [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=238.04s)]
*  and they were very distressed by this operation which they said doesn't do anything to get [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=243.04s)]
*  their loved ones home. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=248.04s)]
*  Ben Weedem in Beirut, thank you so much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=249.04s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=251.04s)]
*  Our veteran law enforcement officer and CNN chief legal and intelligence analyst John [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=252.04s)]
*  Miller standing by. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=255.04s)]
*  John, thanks for joining us. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=256.03999999999996s)]
*  Here's the very first question when I heard about this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  Are you surprised that members of Hezbollah are still walking around with electronics [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  after what happened yesterday? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=265.04s)]
*  You know, I think yesterday was their worst day until today. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=266.04s)]
*  Yesterday they had to worry about these pagers being compromised as a targeted operation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=270.04s)]
*  against one piece of equipment that came from one place. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=275.04s)]
*  When the walkie talkies blew up today, Hezbollah had to come to the full realization of what [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=277.04s)]
*  had only been a suspicion which is what if there's more. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=282.04s)]
*  Now as an organization they have to look at every device they have, figure out where it [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=286.04s)]
*  came from, how they got it, and if it's compromised. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=290.04s)]
*  Which means paranoia and fear has to be very high inside that organization. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=293.04s)]
*  Yeah, maybe put down the Game Boy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=299.04s)]
*  What should we in Hezbollah expect tomorrow? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=301.04s)]
*  Well, that is the root of this operation which is there's two theories on that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=303.04s)]
*  One, if you're Israel and you have converted multiple pieces of equipment that Hezbollah [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=309.04s)]
*  uses, you know they're going to be looking inside everything they own. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=315.04s)]
*  So now might be the time to degrade the organization further by setting them all off. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=320.04s)]
*  On the PsyOps side, Jake, just let them wonder and be on the back foot because if you look [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=325.04s)]
*  at it, they understood their phones were compromised so they moved to pagers. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=332.04s)]
*  Then their pagers were revealed to be self-worn hand grenades controlled by an adversary. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=336.04s)]
*  Then they moved to walkie talkies which started exploding with even larger caches of explosives [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=341.04s)]
*  because the larger device could fit them. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=347.04s)]
*  So now are they down to the point where they have to be sending guys on scooters carrying [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=349.04s)]
*  notes between different commanders in order to communicate in the most old school way possible? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=354.04s)]
*  If you're Hezbollah and you're getting ready to attack Israel, that means your communication [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=360.04s)]
*  slows down to a crawl which in wartime is bad. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=364.04s)]
*  If you're Israel and you're about to attack Hezbollah, that means that their ability to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=368.04s)]
*  communicate, to fight back, is also degraded. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=372.04s)]
*  So basically Hezbollah is reassessing everything about what it's able to do and how it's able [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=375.04s)]
*  to work right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=381.04s)]
*  And what about the psychological effect of these attacks? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=382.04s)]
*  What does this do to the operatives, the terrorists of Hezbollah? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=385.04s)]
*  How does this impact their morale and their effectiveness? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=388.04s)]
*  You know, Jake, this might in the larger picture be a better psychological operations job by [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=392.04s)]
*  the Israeli intelligence and military than it was a tactical success for taking out that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=402.04s)]
*  number of players, which is at the bottom of the organization they have to be asking [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=408.04s)]
*  themselves, do our leaders know what they're doing? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=412.04s)]
*  Do they know what they're buying? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=414.04s)]
*  Do they know where it's coming from? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=416.04s)]
*  And at the top of the organization, the leaders have to be asking, what do we do to fix this? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=417.04s)]
*  Do we have to throw out everything we own and start from scratch in the middle of a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=422.04s)]
*  time when we're expected to be largely at the behest of Iran, attacking Israel as the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=426.04s)]
*  surrogate we have been for that government for a long time. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=432.04s)]
*  It's really got them off balance and questioning their own ability to function. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=435.04s)]
*  Let's talk more about this. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=440.04s)]
*  Firoz Maxord is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute and he joins us now. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=441.04s)]
*  So good to have you with us. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=446.04s)]
*  As we were discussing there, Israel's defense minister called this a new era of war that's [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=447.04s)]
*  just beginning. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=453.04s)]
*  What do you make of this attack and do you see it as a prelude to something bigger? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=454.04s)]
*  Yeah, Julia, if on October 7th, the Israeli intelligence services came across as Johnny [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=459.04s)]
*  English, completely dumbfounded and dumbstruck. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=465.04s)]
*  Today, they look like James Bond carrying out an attack in Lebanon, reaching hundreds [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=468.04s)]
*  of walkie talkies on the heels of thousands of pagers the day before. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=473.04s)]
*  So this is no doubt kind of a new threshold of violence that is being brought by Israel [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=478.04s)]
*  and a breakthrough in terms of its ability to penetrate deep into Hezbollah's networks [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=483.04s)]
*  both in Lebanon but also in Syria next door where some of these Hezbollah operatives are. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=488.04s)]
*  So this is no doubt a significant blow to Hezbollah and a success to Israel. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=494.04s)]
*  The question is what comes next? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=499.04s)]
*  It makes very little strategic sense if Israel stops here. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=501.04s)]
*  This has all the hallmarks of an operation that is a prelude for a broader campaign, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=505.04s)]
*  a broader campaign that now the Israeli defense minister is kind of signaling and hinting [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=511.04s)]
*  might come to follow in the days and weeks ahead. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=516.04s)]
*  How do they seize the moment then to your point about this indeed being some kind of prelude? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=519.04s)]
*  And do they wait for Hezbollah to respond or do they use this moment where they're caught [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=523.04s)]
*  off guard and perhaps trying to recover themselves to continue this and push on? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=528.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, logic would say that time is not in Israel's favor right now. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=534.04s)]
*  Hezbollah is caught completely off balance. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=538.04s)]
*  It's very difficult for a military organization like Hezbollah to carry any kind of coordinated [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=541.04s)]
*  offensive, let alone a defense against an Israeli offensive, if it cannot communicate it, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=547.04s)]
*  if it is largely blinded by the fact that they now do not trust each other. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=552.04s)]
*  They don't know where the moles are in the system. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=557.04s)]
*  They don't really have an effective command and control structure anymore. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=560.04s)]
*  But Hezbollah is also a very effective organization. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=564.04s)]
*  One can expect it to recover pretty quickly. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=568.04s)]
*  So Israel will need to move fast if it wants to take advantage of this element of surprise. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=570.04s)]
*  Obviously, this is not the only factor at play here. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=576.04s)]
*  It is in the process of moving forces from the Gaza Strip in the south up to the north. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=579.04s)]
*  There's also pressure coming from Washington. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=584.04s)]
*  Washington is extremely here. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=587.04s)]
*  U.S. officials very frustrated with their Israeli counterparts and somewhat embarrassing. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=588.04s)]
*  It's somewhat embarrassing that President Biden's envoy was in Israel on Monday, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=593.04s)]
*  and he had barely left Tel Aviv when Israel, in fact, carried out the first of these attacks. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=598.04s)]
*  So a great deal of frustration here by the Biden administration in the fact that Israel has decided to broaden its war in Lebanon. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=604.04s)]
*  I mean, the U.S. and France have been furiously working on some kind of better security arrangement in the south of Lebanon now for months. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=611.04s)]
*  Can you see a path from this moment to achieve that, perhaps utilizing this moment to get there? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=619.04s)]
*  Because everything, of course, still contingent or at least has been to this stage in Hezbollah's mind on that ceasefire negotiations, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=625.04s)]
*  which, as you said, sort of embarrassingly taking place at the same time. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=632.04s)]
*  Yeah. And that's part of the reason why President Biden's envoy, Almas Hoxdeen, was in Tel Aviv. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=637.04s)]
*  Mr. Hoxdeen has pretty much pre-negotiated a deal here between Hezbollah on one hand and Israel on the other [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=643.04s)]
*  that would see a new security arrangement in place in southern Lebanon. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=650.04s)]
*  Hezbollah would withdraw a certain number of kilometers from the border. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=654.04s)]
*  Israel would withdraw and redeploy from some of the 13 points disputed along that border. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=658.04s)]
*  But the problem and the challenge has been that Hezbollah and Iran, its patron, have refused to make good on that deal [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=663.04s)]
*  absent a ceasefire in Gaza that would bring relief to their ally, Hamas. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=670.04s)]
*  And that is, of course, something that we all know is not in the offing, the ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=675.04s)]
*  The talks are completely deadlocked. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=680.04s)]
*  So the preconditioning that Iran and Hezbollah have put in place have essentially allowed this to escalate. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=682.04s)]
*  And in the weeks and the days and weeks ahead, I think Hezbollah faces a very difficult choice. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=688.04s)]
*  Will it accept to decouple the Lebanon front from the Gaza front or will it risk sinking Lebanon? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=693.04s)]
*  And its military capabilities along with it in a devastating war with Israel. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=699.04s)]
*  Which way do you think it goes? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=703.04s)]
*  I apologize for putting you on the spot, but that is a pivoting difficult choice. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=706.04s)]
*  If we had a crystal ball, I think we'd be in a much better place. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=711.04s)]
*  But do you think that we are all going to be anticipating what Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=716.04s)]
*  will have to say in a much anticipated speech tomorrow, 5 p.m. Beirut time? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=723.04s)]
*  He is cornered. He's embarrassed. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=728.04s)]
*  But at the same time, there are quite a bit of limitations in terms of the political and military realities that he has to deal with. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=732.04s)]
*  And Hezbollah and the Iranians are rational actors. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=739.04s)]
*  And so he will try to thread that needle. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=744.04s)]
*  But I would bet that some kind of escalation, some kind of Hezbollah retaliation would be deemed necessary. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=746.04s)]
*  Tonight we're digging deeper into the breaking news on the deadly detonation of Hezbollah communication devices in Lebanon. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=753.04s)]
*  Sources tell CNN the Pager attack on Tuesday was a joint operation involving the Israel Defense Forces and the country's major spy agency, the Mossad. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=760.04s)]
*  CNN's Brian Todd is joining us right now. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=770.04s)]
*  Brian, the Mossad has a history of very brazen and very dangerous missions. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=772.04s)]
*  Wolf, indeed the Mossad has a long, fascinating history of using methods like this and even more bizarre tactics to assassinate its enemies. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=777.04s)]
*  The agency has been conducting operations like this for more than six decades. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=784.04s)]
*  Pagers and walkie-talkies explode throughout Lebanon over the course of two days. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=793.04s)]
*  The latest in a long line of audacious, lethal, sometimes high-tech operations by the legendary Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=797.04s)]
*  The Israelis are the best. If you find your name on one of their hit lists, you know, you probably can't get insured. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=806.04s)]
*  They have excellent operational security. They don't leak. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=813.04s)]
*  This past July, a bomb secretly planted in a Tehran guest house two months in advance is how a source tells CNN Hamas leader Ismael Haniye was killed, which Iran and Hamas say was done by Israel. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=816.04s)]
*  Another assassination in Iran of a top nuclear physicist in 2020 was allegedly conducted by an explosion, plus a remote-controlled machine gun in a car parked nearby. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=829.04s)]
*  And a Palestinian bomb maker nicknamed The Engineer was killed in 1996 using a cell phone with perhaps just over an ounce of explosives. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=840.04s)]
*  He put it up to his ear. The phone said, Hello, Dad. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=849.04s)]
*  And then the Israelis remotely exploded the phone and blew the side of his head off. So it was a very sophisticated operation. It was very precise. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=852.04s)]
*  In the 1970s in Baghdad, according to one historian of the Mossad, an Israeli hit squad placed poison in toothpaste used by a Palestinian militant who later died an excruciating death. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=861.04s)]
*  But there have also been unsuccessful operations. In 1997, Mossad agents in Jordan sprayed a lethal dose of fentanyl into the ear of Hamas leader Khalid Mashal. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=873.04s)]
*  But some of the agents were captured. Israel was forced to provide the antidote and to release at least 19 prisoners. Mashal is still alive today. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=883.04s)]
*  One of Mossad's earliest successes in 1960, agents tracked down notorious Nazi Adolf Eichmann, an architect of the Holocaust. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=892.04s)]
*  He was located and captured hiding in Argentina and spirited back to Israel to stand trial. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=900.04s)]
*  They managed to grab Eichmann, drug him and send him back to Israel as a patient. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=906.04s)]
*  Eichmann was executed in 1962. Mossad also tracked down almost every terrorist who killed Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=911.04s)]
*  During Operation Wrath of God, suspects were assassinated one by one. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=921.04s)]
*  But so was a Moroccan waiter in Norway who, in a case of mistaken identity, was killed but turned out not to have been involved. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=926.04s)]
*  Still, operations like these recent ones against Hezbollah have a lasting effect on Israel's enemies. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=933.04s)]
*  Psychologically, they're going to turn on one another. Who are the informants? How could this happen? They're going to be fearful. They're going to be, in short, disrupted. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=939.04s)]
*  The New York Times, citing officials and security experts, reports that earlier this year Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah put strict limits on the group's use of cell phones because he thought they were too vulnerable to Israeli surveillance. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=949.04s)]
*  Wolf? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=961.04s)]
*  All right, Brian Todd reporting for us. Brian, thank you very, very much. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=962.04s)]
*  Here to discuss more broadly, Matthew Levitt, director of the Reinhardt Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=966.04s)]
*  And Fouaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and author of What Really Went Wrong? The West and the Failure of Diplomacy in the Middle East. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=975.04s)]
*  Certainly a timely title. Fouaz, if I could begin with you, what is your assessment as to the function of these attacks? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=985.04s)]
*  Simply to disrupt Hezbollah, or do you see it as laying the groundwork for major or at least additional military action? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=995.04s)]
*  I don't see Israel's strategic endgame here. I don't really see how these attacks, I mean, shattering as they are, powerful as they are psychologically and tactically. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1005.04s)]
*  I don't really see them changing Israel's predicament on the northern front between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1023.04s)]
*  If Israel leaders believe that Hezbollah will stand down, that Hezbollah will surrender, they are delusional. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1031.04s)]
*  They do not really know Hezbollah, its identity, its ideology, its stamina. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1038.04s)]
*  Look, Hezbollah gym is not a conventional army, even though it's a very powerful military apparatus. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1045.04s)]
*  Its units are sovereign, independent. They have been trained for years that if they lose any kind of the ability to connect with the commanders, they can take action to their own. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1051.04s)]
*  Of course, the rank and file of Hezbollah are rattled. They are shocked as a result of what has happened. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1063.04s)]
*  But I doubted very much whether what has happened will change the rules of the game on the Israel-Lebanese front. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1069.04s)]
*  Matthew, when I was in Israel just a little over two, three weeks ago, there was, it appeared, a major Hezbollah attack plan that, based on U.S. and Israeli intelligence in advance, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1076.04s)]
*  Israel attacked Hezbollah positions prior to the launching of those missiles and rockets here. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1089.04s)]
*  I wonder, is Hezbollah, in your view, likely to respond by attempting to escalate its attacks on Israel? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1095.04s)]
*  And can it do so effectively now that its communications have been disrupted? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1102.04s)]
*  Well, you just hit the nail on the head. Hezbollah may want to respond forcefully, but taking out key communications systems, in the plural, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1107.04s)]
*  means that Hezbollah is not as capable to fight a coordinated, especially longer-term fight, a military fight. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1118.04s)]
*  Shooting rockets across the border, as it's been doing almost daily for 11 months, it can still do. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1127.04s)]
*  But if it decides to ratchet things up and the Israelis respond in a heavier fashion, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1132.04s)]
*  Hezbollah is no longer in the position today that it was two and a half days ago to respond to that. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1137.04s)]
*  And so, look, the Israelis clearly inserted this capability some time ago. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1143.04s)]
*  Reportedly, they acted now when they did because someone in Hezbollah picked up on it and it was more of a use it or lose it. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1148.04s)]
*  But the decision to use it, I think, was actually an effort to forestall an increased military conflict, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1154.04s)]
*  demonstrating to Hezbollah their consequences to continuing the daily rockets that have been going on for almost a year [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1161.04s)]
*  and making clear that either Amos Hoxdeen's diplomatic effort has given more attention [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1168.04s)]
*  or that the Israelis mean it when they say that they will redeploy Hezbollah from the border [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1173.04s)]
*  to be able to allow its 60,000 displaced civilians to go back home. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1177.04s)]
*  Fawaz, CNN is reporting that Israel did not give the U.S. a heads-up to the specifics of this attack. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1181.04s)]
*  It may have communicated that something was coming. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1188.04s)]
*  But you can view this certainly as an escalation in terms of the kind of attack that, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1192.04s)]
*  assuming this is Israel and no one in the region seems to be questioning that based on capabilities, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1197.04s)]
*  what is the state of U.S. influence over Israel right now? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1202.04s)]
*  The U.S. president and secretary of state have made a priority to deliver a peace deal in Gaza, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1207.04s)]
*  some attempt to reduce the chances of escalation on the northern border. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1213.04s)]
*  Is Israel plowing ahead regardless of what counsel the U.S. gives it? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1218.04s)]
*  There's one word to explain the Biden administration strategy, and I'm not exaggerating, it's failure. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1227.04s)]
*  It has failed to influence the decision-making process of Israel. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1234.04s)]
*  It has failed to convince Israeli prime minister to accept the ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1239.04s)]
*  It has failed to basically use leverage, or it did not really want to use leverage, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1246.04s)]
*  in order to bring about the end of bloodshed in Gaza. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1252.04s)]
*  I mean, look, President Biden's own info just a couple of days ago, he made it very clear, leaked by the New York Times. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1255.04s)]
*  Well, look, if you think that a ground assault on Lebanon will return, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1263.04s)]
*  Israeli displaced people to the northern front, to their homes, again, he said, in fact, the opposite will happen. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1269.04s)]
*  You're going to have hundreds of thousands of Israelis basically becoming displaced as a result of an all-out war with Hezbollah. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1275.04s)]
*  Here is, Jim, the predicament. Both sides face a strategic predicament. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1282.04s)]
*  Hezbollah wants to retaliate, but without triggering all-out war with Israel. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1287.04s)]
*  Hezbollah's overarching goal is to really avoid all-out war with Israel. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1292.04s)]
*  Israel's strategic predicament is basically it wants to change the rules of engagement on the northern front with Hezbollah without launching a ground attack. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1297.04s)]
*  I think Anthony Blinken made it very clear in his press conference today in Cairo. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1307.04s)]
*  He said, look, the way forward is a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1312.04s)]
*  Basically, a ceasefire in Gaza will bring about de-escalation, and I think this might break the deadly embrace between Hezbollah and Israel if and when a ceasefire is reaching Gaza. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1315.04s)]
*  Matthew, I wonder if you agree with that assessment. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1327.04s)]
*  There's certainly an enormous amount of evidence that U.S. protestations have been met with, if not silence, not exactly action. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1330.04s)]
*  I think, for instance, there are U.S. hostages held by Hamas, and the U.S. has attempted to prioritize the release of those hostages, but those hostages remain in Hamas custody, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1340.04s)]
*  and it doesn't look like there's a great way forward for those negotiations. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1350.04s)]
*  Is Netanyahu effectively ignoring Biden at this point? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1354.04s)]
*  Look, there are two sides to these ceasefire negotiations, and neither have been as forthcoming as Washington would like them to be. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1360.04s)]
*  But in my conversations with people directly involved in these negotiations, the reality is that it's not Netanyahu who's holding them up in the moment, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1367.04s)]
*  but rather Hamas, fearful that if there is a ceasefire that gets to stage one, it won't get to stage two. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1375.04s)]
*  Hamas has been changing the names of people it wants released, the most senior, the most dangerous, the most blood on their hands in the first round. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1381.04s)]
*  U.S. officials are frustrated with Netanyahu, to be sure. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1390.04s)]
*  They are more frustrated with Hamas right now. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1394.04s)]
*  We do have U.S. personnel working full-time here and forward deployed on the U.S. hostages. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1396.04s)]
*  There have been over 40 victims of October 7th U.S. citizens. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1405.04s)]
*  But if there is not going to be a ceasefire, then from the Israeli perspective, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1410.04s)]
*  they need to do something to change Hezbollah's calculus to raise the cost of shooting every day. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1417.04s)]
*  I think Foaz is right in that if there is a ceasefire, and that would be the best outcome, of course, then Hezbollah would stop. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1422.04s)]
*  And then we'd be facing something with a longer tail, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1429.04s)]
*  which would be whether there is a conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in the next one to three years, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1434.04s)]
*  which I think unfortunately is likely because the Israeli perspective, as I've heard from people over and over across the political spectrum, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1439.04s)]
*  they say we will not live with a gun to our head, not from the south and not from the north. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1446.04s)]
*  Well, the question will be, right, are negotiations part of that process going forward, or is it, well, is it purely military action? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1451.04s)]
*  Matthew Levitt, Foaz Jerjes, thanks so much to both of you. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNmfu9CsTOk&t=1460.04s)]
