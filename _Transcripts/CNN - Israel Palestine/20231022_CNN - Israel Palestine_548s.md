# House Intel Chair on why he thinks Hamas released American hostages
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0)
*  The Biden administration is asking Israel to delay its ground incursion into Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's according to two sources briefed on discussions who say that the delay would potentially [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=5.8s)]
*  allow for both more negotiations over the hostages that Hamas took on October 7th and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=10.66s)]
*  also would allow for more aid to be allowed to be delivered to innocent civilians in Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=17.98s)]
*  The sources say that Friday's release of two American hostages, Judith and Natalie [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=24.72s)]
*  Renan from outside Chicago signaled that negotiators believed they could make progress on freeing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=29.2s)]
*  some of the more than 200 hostages believed to be currently held by Hamas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=36.16s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss is the chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=41.04s)]
*  Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=45.28s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=47.6s)]
*  So two American hostages were released by Hamas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=50.36s)]
*  This is obviously a brutal terrorist group. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=54.7s)]
*  They didn't release the hostages out of the goodness of their hearts or for humanitarian reasons. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=57.5s)]
*  So why did they release the hostages? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=61.94s)]
*  What did they get in exchange? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=64.54s)]
*  Well, certainly they're continuing to have negotiations and discussions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  But what we're very aware of, which as you just noted, is Hamas is a franchise of Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=71.48s)]
*  The brutal terrorist attacks that have occurred in Israel are going to result in Israel entering [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=76.14s)]
*  into Gaza and in taking this conflict to Hamas itself in order to diminish their ability to continue to threaten Israel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=81.66s)]
*  As we see that unfold, certainly getting humanitarian aid is important. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=91.1s)]
*  Getting the hostages back are important. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=94.94s)]
*  And as there are opportunities that those break, certainly they need to be pursued. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=96.46s)]
*  But if the United States should not be dictating to Israel the prosecution of this conflict, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=101.66s)]
*  they certainly are on the ground. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=107.42s)]
*  They know the risks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  They know the consequences. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=109.34s)]
*  And certainly the United States supports their efforts to diminish this terrorist threat. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=111.98s)]
*  How involved were American officials in securing the release of these two American hostages? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=118.7s)]
*  And are you optimistic more hostages might be released? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=123.42s)]
*  Do you know how do you know how many more Americans are currently being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=126.94s)]
*  No, I would certainly say that Hamas needs to release all hostages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=134.38s)]
*  And certainly all American hostages. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=138.7s)]
*  There are some reports that have been public that perhaps all the Hamas leadership was not aware [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=141.1s)]
*  of the brutal terrorist attack that was going to occur into Israel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=146.22s)]
*  That may be some surprise in leadership of Hamas that they now find themselves with tanks on their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  borders and a conflict going to ensue. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=154.22s)]
*  And they may see that these hostages are an important opportunity to return them back to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=159.89999999999998s)]
*  Israel and the United States so that they can get out of the way and hopefully address this issue [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=166.38s)]
*  of how will they move from a terrorist organization and state, a franchise of Iran, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=171.74s)]
*  to an area where there can be peace. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=176.62s)]
*  So obviously as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=178.46s)]
*  you're a member of the Gang of Eight, you get to see the very top classified intelligence. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=180.7s)]
*  Who is responsible for the explosion at the Baptist Hospital in Gaza Tuesday, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=186.06s)]
*  the Palestinian Health Ministry, which is obviously controlled by Hamas, blamed on the Israelis, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=192.62s)]
*  but U.S. intelligence seems to have concluded it was actually more likely to have been caused [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=199.57999999999998s)]
*  by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=205.26s)]
*  Who is responsible, according to the evidence you've seen, and how conclusive is that intelligence? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, my counterpart, ranking member Jim Himes from Connecticut, the two of us received a briefing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=214.46s)]
*  that included not just the conclusions by the administration, but also the assessment, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=220.54s)]
*  what was the process undertaken in order to determine that this was not the fault of Israel? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=224.45999999999998s)]
*  And both of us concluded, in fact, we released a statement that we concur with the administration's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=230.94s)]
*  conclusion that this was not a result of Israeli action. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=235.73999999999998s)]
*  There is a Democratic member of Congress who's out there still blaming it on Israel, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=240.7s)]
*  and I've heard some members say that she should be briefed. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  And I'm wondering, is there an intelligence briefing being offered to members of Congress [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=251.42s)]
*  so that everyone can be informed as to what the latest information is? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=257.26s)]
*  Sure. Well, the administration's actually done a very good job of pulling together both the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=264.46s)]
*  leadership in the House. We've been to the meeting with Jake Sullivan at the National Security Council [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=268.21999999999997s)]
*  and getting their information and get a briefing directly from him. Plus, all of the House of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=273.5s)]
*  Representatives were called into a briefing where we both had the Office of Director of National [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=279.09999999999997s)]
*  Intelligence and the Department of Defense. So there's been a tremendous amount of effort to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=284.62s)]
*  get information to members. And I think this is very important as it has been in the Ukraine [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=288.7s)]
*  conflict, especially as the administration moves forward to look for an aid package [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=292.86s)]
*  to get through Congress for both the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=297.5s)]
*  Based on what you know, do you think the Israelis are doing enough to protect the innocent civilians [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=302.22s)]
*  in Gaza? I'm sure you've heard Israeli leadership say that Palestinians are victims of Hamas as well. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=309.58000000000004s)]
*  And then they are. I mean, there was no question, you know, there was an election in which Hamas, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=319.90000000000003s)]
*  you know, came to power in Gaza and then suspended all elections. And certainly the people in Gaza [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=324.46000000000004s)]
*  are captive to them. And there's certainly a brutal terrorist organization that is ruling [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=330.7s)]
*  that area. And I do think that the people and the Palestinians in Gaza are victims of them as well. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  Israel has done a great deal of effort to try to get people to move out of the way as they go in to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=341.34s)]
*  try to remove Hamas and its ability to execute terrorist acts. This certainly is going to be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=347.02s)]
*  very, very difficult. I do know that the United States is working both on the intelligence side [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=354.78s)]
*  and the strategy side with Israel to try to determine ways to increase the security of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=359.41999999999996s)]
*  Palestinians in the area who are not involved in Hamas. But this is obviously going to be very, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=366.46s)]
*  very difficult. And it goes both to the security and safety of the Palestinians and the Israelis [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=372.14s)]
*  that Hamas be removed. President Biden just announced a $105 billion aid package [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  for Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and the southern border. Obviously, the legislative branch of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=384.62s)]
*  the United States government can't do anything until House Republicans pick a speaker. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=390.22s)]
*  A, do you support the package? B, at what point does the dysfunction of House Republicans [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=395.82s)]
*  jeopardize national security? Right, I do support the package. I think it's incredibly important [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=403.98s)]
*  that we move forward to make certain that we stand up against the authoritarian regimes that [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=410.38s)]
*  are trying to undermine democracies that are our allies. I think also that we should be more [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=414.62s)]
*  focused on Russia as a threat to the United States than we have been, because this is not just an [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=419.82s)]
*  issue of Ukraine or not Ukraine. This is an issue of Russia as our adversary, and they intend to do [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=424.14s)]
*  us and our allies harm. And of course, with Israel, this is one that has great clarity, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=429.58s)]
*  we've all seen and have just been saddened by the atrocities that we've seen and the need for [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=435.1s)]
*  addressing the issue of Hamas. With respect to the national security, clearly having a house that's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=442.78000000000003s)]
*  not functioning is certainly a security threat for our country. This aid package, though, is not [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=447.34000000000003s)]
*  being delayed as a result of the House. At this point, the Senate has taken up this aid package. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=453.34000000000003s)]
*  It looks like it'll be about two weeks before that package comes out of the Senate itself. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  And certainly, we all hope we'll have a speaker by then. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  There are seven candidates so far for a speaker. Is there one that you particularly [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=465.42s)]
*  are leaning towards? And do you think that that person can get 217 votes? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=471.02000000000004s)]
*  You know, getting 217 is obviously going to be very difficult and is the sort of Rubik's cube of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=476.78000000000003s)]
*  the answer to all of this. I supported Kevin McCarthy. I supported Jim Jordan. I supported [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=481.98s)]
*  Scalise. I supported Jim on the floor also. I think we need to find someone who hopefully can [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=486.62s)]
*  get to 217 before we're all poised in very drama fashion on the House floor trying to determine how [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=492.3s)]
*  this will unfold. I really hope in the next several days as we come together as a Republican caucus [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=498.46000000000004s)]
*  that we're able to resolve that so that we go unified to the House floor and deliver a speaker. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=504.86s)]
*  I hope you don't take this personally, but do you guys have any idea how clownish you look? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=510.38s)]
*  Well, you know, Jake, I'm very fond of saying that Congress is a light like high school, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=516.22s)]
*  but even more so. So hopefully we'll get past this. And, you know, I certainly have been part [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=521.02s)]
*  of the governing majority and I'm going to stay part of that and look forward to those who are on [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=526.22s)]
*  the fringes hopefully coming together so that we can get a speaker. I said that to Congressman [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=531.9s)]
*  Womack last week, high school, and he said that that's an insult to high school students. It's [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=536.62s)]
*  more like junior high. Congressman Turner, Chairman Turner, good to see you. I hope you guys pick a [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=539.9s)]
*  speaker sometime soon. Great. Thanks, Jake. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjA4Xz4bRU0&t=544.3s)]
