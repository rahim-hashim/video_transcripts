# Trump says the US 'will take over' Gaza. Hear the reaction of Palestinians
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho)
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington as the world is processing a stunning proposal from President Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=0.0s)]
*  That would upend decades of US policy in the Middle East [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=6.44s)]
*  The president is calling for US ownership of Gaza and relocating the 2 million Palestinians who live there to other countries [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=9.96s)]
*  Trump adds that will then give the US an opportunity to develop the area into a worldwide destination [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=18.56s)]
*  He also says he's not ruling out military force to make this happen something the White House tried to explain just moments ago [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=24.88s)]
*  Why not rule out the idea of committing US troops? This has been a long-standing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=32.8s)]
*  Argument that the president has made really over the last decade or so talking about endless wars and something us ones [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=38.28s)]
*  Why not rule out? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=44.82s)]
*  because I think the president is very good when he's making deals in negotiating not to rule out anything because [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=45.6s)]
*  He wants to preserve that leverage and negotiations and so I think that's what he's doing here [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=51.56s)]
*  Israel's far-right lawmakers are hailing Trump's plan the Palestinian Authority says the move would be a recipe for chaos [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=58.64s)]
*  Meantime here in Washington Democrats on Capitol Hill are slamming the president's idea while some Republicans don't seem willing to jump on board [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=65.8s)]
*  So quickly CNN's Nick Robertson is live with us now for more reaction London in London Nick. What can you tell us? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=72.76s)]
*  Yeah, just last week Boris when this was beginning to become an idea that [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=80.44s)]
*  President Trump supported the ideas of pushing out Garzans from Gaza [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=85.0s)]
*  I spoke to a regional diplomat who said to me just look at the people in Gaza the Garzans [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=88.48s)]
*  They're going back to their powers of rubble. So, you know what we did that today [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=94.88s)]
*  We sent our cameraman down there to go and talk to them and they were adamant. They don't want to leave [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=99.08s)]
*  Here's what they said [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  All of our children's homes have been demolished and our house is half destroyed [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Rain comes into the house cold is coming in and we will still stay whatever happens [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  Even if we stay in the tent, even if they give us castles and villas, we are not leaving our lands [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=118.8s)]
*  Well, I want to die in my land to stay in it. I was born in Gaza [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=123.96s)]
*  Lived in Gaza studied in Gaza. I got married here and had my children whatever happens. I will never leave it [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=129.2s)]
*  And it's not just the people of Gaza who are saying this we've heard today from the king of Jordan [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=137.88s)]
*  Jordan's one of the countries that President Trump suggested these Garzans could go to and he has said we reject the idea of displacement [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=143.5s)]
*  We've heard that from the French today French officials Kirstama the British Prime Minister in Parliament today answering questions [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=150.72s)]
*  Got to got questions about this because it's such a sensitive topic and he said look absolutely [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=157.92s)]
*  Garzans have a right to go home [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=164.04000000000002s)]
*  They have a right to rebuild their homes and he said we should be [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=166.12s)]
*  Supporting them in that that is that is pretty straight-up rejection [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=170.72s)]
*  And I think what is interesting first out the gate to respond last night with the Saudis who very quickly said [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=173.94s)]
*  We only support a two-state solution with the Palestinians [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=179.56s)]
*  They're not taking on Trump on the issue of pushing out Garzans, but it's clear [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  It's obvious and I've heard this behind the scenes from diplomats that if you talk about pushing out the Garzans from Gaza [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=188.56s)]
*  You end the possibility of a two-state solution. So the message very clear from the region for us. Don't do it. It's a bad idea [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=194.64s)]
*  That's the message [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=201.56s)]
*  Nick Robertson. Thanks so much [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Let's expand the conversation now with CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Layton and CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=205.36s)]
*  Thank you both always great to see you Kim aside from being highly [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=212.6s)]
*  Unlikely as a resolution for Gaza these kind of comments also serve as a recruiting tool for jihadi groups [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=217.12s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, this is the third rail in Middle East politics. You do not [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  fulfill the worst fears of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  Everyone in the Middle East that the US would be on Israel's side in all things by saying something like this and this will be a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=233.28s)]
*  Recruiting poster for al-qaeda for Isis most of all for Hamas the moment anyone tries to move the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=241.0s)]
*  Palestinians out of Gaza. You've got something like two million Gazans there [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=248.11999999999998s)]
*  More than half of them do not support Hamas right now [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=253.0s)]
*  But the moment you tell them that you've got to leave because of a US plan backed by Israel [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=255.88s)]
*  Every single one will join Hamas and fight [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=261.08s)]
*  So this just isn't going to happen this thing that Trump is is talking about, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=263.0s)]
*  I mean but it forces everyone to react to it [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=270.08s)]
*  They have to work through the details of it why this detail that thing isn't going to work [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=274.08s)]
*  Talk a little bit about that Cedric and sort of the oxygen that that swallows up [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=279.92s)]
*  When this whole thing kind of seems like a feudal exercise [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=284.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's this is really interesting just from a psychological standpoint Brianna because what you're looking at here is a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=288.76s)]
*  You know as you mentioned Kim [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=295.32s)]
*  This is the third rail of Middle Eastern politics and what that really means is if you start talking about this kind of thing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=296.92s)]
*  Then you're not talking about implementing phase two of the ceasefire. You're not talking about what comes next [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=303.12s)]
*  You're not talking about good governance for Gaza or protecting the Palestinians who live there or frankly the Israelis on the other side of the border [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=308.48s)]
*  What you do about Hamas and what you do a must about Hamas because Hamas all of a sudden ceases to exist in this kind of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=316.28s)]
*  Fantasy world that we're living in right now [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=323.88s)]
*  And if Hamas doesn't exist in the fantasy world, but it exists in reality [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=325.64s)]
*  Then you're going to have a problem because if you go in there from a military standpoint [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=330.72s)]
*  Or a diplomatic standpoint or even a humanitarian standpoint, and you don't realize what the threats actually are [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=335.32s)]
*  You are going in into a very dangerous situation that is going to put people not only at risk [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  But it will kill people it's almost as if we didn't live through Iraq [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=347.08000000000004s)]
*  Exactly, I do wonder Colonel the White House keeps talking about bringing in [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=351.16s)]
*  Regional partners what regional partner would support this? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=356.64s)]
*  Well, you know we I think certainly Jordan and Egypt are off the table when it comes to this [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  They're not going to be accepting anybody from Gaza. At least that's what they tell us now and they've told us that for decades [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=366.08s)]
*  Then you look at [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=371.68s)]
*  Gulf State partners potentially one clue might be the Qataris, you know based on the nuanced [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=373.36s)]
*  Expressions from the foreign minister. However, however, they have not done this up until this point [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=380.08s)]
*  Nobody has mustered in all Arab force of peacekeepers. Nobody has come in and said, okay [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  We're going to take over we're going to use troops [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  Let's say from the African Union or we're going to use troops from the Arab League [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  None of that has happened and the UN is not willing to do any of this kind of these kinds of maneuvers [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=399.96s)]
*  There's no peacekeeping force like we have in Lebanon [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=406.28s)]
*  Or had at least on the Golan Heights [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=409.28s)]
*  So this is the kind of thing that we're getting into there [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=412.52s)]
*  It's basically uncharted territory from a diplomatic standpoint and it's an area where you really can't move forward [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=415.28s)]
*  Because there are no structures in place to make it real and just to jump in on that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=422.44s)]
*  One of the things that Qatari foreign minister was saying an interesting take he was emphasizing in public comments today [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=427.76s)]
*  Yes, we Gulf nations need to work together to rebuild Gaza [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  But right now we're concentrating on phase two of the negotiations as if to say [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=439.12s)]
*  Don't look at all this craziness over here [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=444.24s)]
*  We're staying focused on the one thing that will drive us forward [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=446.94000000000005s)]
*  Good attempt. The problem is now that President Trump has said that out loud and his White House press secretary has doubled down on it [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=451.04s)]
*  The main message it sends is that this administration will not support a two-state solution [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  Most importantly that it won't force Israel to make painful territorial [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=464.0s)]
*  Sacrifices that would be needed to make two separate states possible [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=469.16s)]
*  So that sort of jumps off of Nick Robertson's point [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=474.52000000000004s)]
*  Tell me you don't support the two-state solution without telling me you don't support the two-state solution [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  Not going to come out and just say that right? So [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=484.92s)]
*  What is that? We see what this what the effect this has on that conversation? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  Where do you go from there? Well, one of the things is this does jolt all the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  Operators in the region that look this White House doesn't see anyone to talk to on the Palestinian side [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=499.16s)]
*  So you all have to work together to step in and present a credible option [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=505.88s)]
*  Behind closed doors to President Trump. You also have to rush in that the diplomats I've been speaking to Arab diplomats [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=512.36s)]
*  For regional diplomats are like we got to get to him behind closed doors and [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=519.64s)]
*  Make our case to him because the Israelis already beat us to it [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=524.0s)]
*  Can I ask you because it is hard to see who? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  Who on the Palestinian side would be the one leading the charge in some kind of conversations? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=530.88s)]
*  So then why is it still important to acknowledge a path forward? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=535.64s)]
*  Even in the absence of making any real progress or being able to at this point in time right now [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, one of the main things that Trump wants is expansion of Abraham Accords and the only way to do that is to get [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=546.18s)]
*  Saudi Arabia to sign on and Saudi Arabia has said again in the past 24 hours [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=552.18s)]
*  it is not possible without a two-state solution, so they are holding firm to that and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=556.38s)]
*  We're frozen until they move forward. Yeah, that's going to complicate everything because the Saudis are key to this and if they don't [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=562.62s)]
*  Move forward with this idea with this if they stick with the two-state solution idea, which they will [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=570.8199999999999s)]
*  That is going to make this basically untenable [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=575.94s)]
*  Kim Cedric, thank you so much to both of you. Appreciate it [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LE2RfRrwho&t=579.9000000000001s)]
