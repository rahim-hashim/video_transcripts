# Threats of all-out war grow between Israel and Hezbollah
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0)
*  The European Union's top diplomat warns the risk of Israel's war spilling over into Lebanon is growing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=0.0s)]
*  Joseph Burrell says he's much more worried than before, pointing to increased bombings on both sides of the border. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=6.2s)]
*  Ben Widerman is in Lebanon, where life goes on as the shadow of war looms large. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=12.32s)]
*  It's a day of joy and celebration here in South Lebanon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Israeli forces are just about five miles away from here, but nonetheless here in the town of Hasbaya, there's a wedding going on. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=24.72s)]
*  It didn't seem right to spoil this special day for newlyweds Teymour and Fatin, with questions about the dark clouds hovering over Lebanon. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=36.68s)]
*  But one guest told us off camera, we're celebrating here while war is around the corner. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=45.8s)]
*  Hasbaya has been spared the worst of the barrages and counter barrages between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=52.6s)]
*  Here they stop anyone from firing towards Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=59.84s)]
*  Parliament member Ilyas Jaradi was elected to represent Christians in this area. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  The majority of the southern people, majority of the Lebanese people, from all sects, all religions, all parties, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=70.16s)]
*  they are in one way or another, they are committed with the Palestinians. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  Everyone we spoke with had a completely contrary opinion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=83.6s)]
*  Few people wanted to speak on camera about the looming danger of war for fear of repercussions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=88.52s)]
*  Off camera, we got an earful. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=94.44s)]
*  There is zero appetite for escalation, little support for Hezbollah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=97.44s)]
*  Eighty-five-year-old Abu Nabil has seen it all. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=103.24s)]
*  War and civil war, invasions and occupation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=106.56s)]
*  War is ruination, he says, and war everyone loses, even the winner. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=113.0s)]
*  Abu Nabil knows of what he speaks. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=118.44s)]
*  Since October, Israel and Hezbollah and its allies have been engaged in low-intensity warfare, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  largely limited to the border. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=127.52s)]
*  If full-scale war breaks out, that war will spread well beyond the frontier on both sides. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=129.76s)]
*  Last week, Israeli generals approved a plan to attack Lebanon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=139.04s)]
*  While Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah recently warned if it comes to war, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=144.32s)]
*  the group will fight Israel on land, sea and air, and also inside Israel itself. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=148.72s)]
*  The Iranian-backed group's sophisticated attacks have surprised Israeli officials, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=155.36s)]
*  including precision strikes on surveillance posts on the border, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=162.16s)]
*  shooting down high-flying Israeli drones and knocking out anti-missile and anti-drone defenses, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=167.04s)]
*  and posting online more than nine minutes of what it claimed was drone footage of sensitive [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  military and civilian infrastructure in and around the city of Haifa. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=180.4s)]
*  The bell summons the faithful to mass in the predominantly Christian town of Marja'ayoun. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  More than 90,000 people have already left the south for safer ground. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=195.2s)]
*  Amal says she's determined to stay, but adds, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=201.84s)]
*  If things escalate to war and it reaches here like it did before with some shelling, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=206.0s)]
*  of course, like others, we'll have to leave. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  For now, they can only pray for peace and hope those prayers are heard. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=215.67999999999998s)]
*  Ben Weederman joins us now from Beirut. Ben, I want you to unpack this for us because the rate [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=226.64s)]
*  of change has definitely changed. There's a sense and major concern about potential escalation. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=232.4s)]
*  Israel last week approving operational plans for potential offensive in Lebanon. Netanyahu is saying [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  they might shift focus to Lebanon. How are people responding on the ground and what are [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=243.68s)]
*  they reading into this new rhetoric about the prospect of a bigger conflict? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=249.68s)]
*  Well, people have heard here in Lebanon for months now, sort of saber rattling coming from [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=254.24s)]
*  Israel. But I think what has people really worried was what we've heard reported on CNN [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  that the Biden administration has expressed its full support for Israel in the event of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=272.64s)]
*  full scale hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, which is rather reminiscent of the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=281.2s)]
*  full bodied support the Americans voiced at the beginning of the disastrous war in Gaza. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  So really that has people worried. And we're already seeing signs of things, for instance, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=292.88s)]
*  cancellations in hotels. Lebanon in the summer, Lebanon is highly dependent on [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=299.76s)]
*  members of the Lebanese diaspora and tourists to come here to bring badly needed hard cash. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=306.16s)]
*  There have been many cancellations at hotels and elsewhere. We also know that Kuwait, Sweden and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=314.0s)]
*  North Macedonia have warned their citizens not to travel to Lebanon under the current [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=322.56s)]
*  circumstances and those who are here to leave immediately. This is reminiscent, of course, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=329.68s)]
*  of the kind of things we were seeing back in October last year. And finally, the London [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=336.24s)]
*  Telegraph has put out a report saying that the Beirut International Airport is being used as a [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=342.32s)]
*  storage depot for weapons by Hezbollah. Now, Lebanese officials have come out and flatly [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=348.8s)]
*  denied that the Minister of Information, the Minister of Transport and the Foreign Minister [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=355.6s)]
*  actually led a tour of journalists and foreign diplomats to show them there's nothing there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=361.92s)]
*  But people are worried that this is a sign that, for instance, there is a target that the Israelis [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=368.8s)]
*  might hit the airport, which is essential for this small country, which only has one international [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=374.8s)]
*  airport. Eleni? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=381.28s)]
*  Yeah, Ben Wideman, thank you so much for that analysis. Good to see you. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-g3tHgUfW0&t=385.03999999999996s)]
