**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ)
*  That is the president you see there with the vice president and the secretary of state. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=3.6s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  It's a very good afternoon because at long last I can announce a ceasefire and a hostage [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  deal has been reached between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=14.52s)]
*  More than 15 months of conflict began with Hezbollah's brutal massacre on October 7th. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=19.52s)]
*  More than 15 months of terror for the hostages, their families, the Israeli people. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=25.96s)]
*  More than 15 months of suffering by the innocent people of Gaza. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=32.08s)]
*  Fighting in Gaza will stop and soon the hostages will return home to their families. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=37.68s)]
*  The elements of this deal are what I laid out in detail this past May, which was embraced [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  by countries around the world and endorsed overwhelmingly by the U.N. Security Council. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  The deal is structured in three phases. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=58.76s)]
*  Phase one will last six weeks. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=62.44s)]
*  It includes a full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=64.92s)]
*  populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=70.19999999999999s)]
*  women and elderly and the wounded. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  And I'm proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release in phase one as well. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=81.0s)]
*  And the Vice President and I cannot wait to welcome them home. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=86.16s)]
*  In exchange, Israel will release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=91.16s)]
*  And during phase one, the Palestinians can also return to their neighborhoods in all [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=94.56s)]
*  the areas of Gaza. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=100.32s)]
*  And the surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza will begin. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=101.32s)]
*  And the innocent people can have a greater access to these vital supplies. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=106.28s)]
*  You know, during the next six weeks, Israel will negotiate the necessary arrangements [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=112.44s)]
*  to get phase two, which is a permanent end of the war. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=117.76s)]
*  Let me say it again, a permanent end of the war. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=122.0s)]
*  There are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=124.44s)]
*  The plan says if negotiations take longer than six weeks, the ceasefire will continue [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=131.4s)]
*  as long as the negotiations continue. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=138.16s)]
*  I've spoken to the mayor of Kuwait and the president of Egypt, and we have pledged to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=141.6s)]
*  make sure the negotiations will keep moving forward for as long as it takes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=147.52s)]
*  Then, when phase two begins, there will be an exchange for release of the remaining living [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=153.56s)]
*  hostages, including male soldiers. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=160.52s)]
*  And all remaining Israeli forces will be withdrawn from Gaza. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=163.16s)]
*  And a temporary ceasefire will become permanent. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=167.28s)]
*  And finally, phase three, any final remains of hostages who have been killed will be returned [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=171.4s)]
*  to their families. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=178.44s)]
*  And a major reconstruction plan for Gaza will begin. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=180.36s)]
*  This is the ceasefire agreement I introduced last spring. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  Today, Hamas and Israel have agreed to that ceasefire agreement and the whole ending of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  the war. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=197.0s)]
*  You know, those of you who have followed the negotiations can attest the road to this deal [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=198.0s)]
*  has not been easy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=202.84s)]
*  I've worked in foreign policy for decades. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=204.8s)]
*  This is one of the toughest negotiations I've ever experienced. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  And we reached this point because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas, backed by the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=210.56s)]
*  United States. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  Hamas's longtime leader, Sinwar, was killed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=218.84s)]
*  Hamas's strongest supporter, Iran, launched attacks on Israel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=222.56s)]
*  And those attacks failed after my administration organized a coalition of nations to stop them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=227.4s)]
*  And after I ordered the U.S. ships and planes to come to Israel's defense, we also shaped [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel's strong and calibrated response, destroying Iran's air defenses, but avoiding [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  an eschatological cycle of an all-out war. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  The United States also organized a coalition of 20 countries to stand up to attacks by [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  the Houthis, including their missile attacks on Israel. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=255.0s)]
*  Then Hezbollah, another of Hamas's strongest backers, was significantly weakened on the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=260.0s)]
*  battlefield and its leadership was destroyed. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=266.36s)]
*  With our support, Israel negotiated a ceasefire with them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=270.16s)]
*  And after that, Lebanon finally elected a new president who's not — who's not [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=275.0s)]
*  beholden to Hezbollah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=280.24s)]
*  And he can begin a new chapter for the Lebanese people. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=281.24s)]
*  We're all told these developments in the region, which the United States helped to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=286.44s)]
*  shape, changed the equation. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=290.16s)]
*  And so now the terror network that once protected and sustained Hamas is far weaker. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=293.12s)]
*  Iran is weaker. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=298.84s)]
*  Iran is weaker than it's been in decades. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=301.04s)]
*  Hezbollah is badly degraded. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=303.72s)]
*  And after more than 15 months of war, Hamas's senior leaders are dead. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=306.12s)]
*  Thousands of Hamas fighters are dead. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=311.32s)]
*  And the military formations have been destroyed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=313.96s)]
*  With nowhere to turn, Hamas finally agreed to releasing hostages. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=317.88s)]
*  You know, there was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  And I'm deeply satisfied. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  This day has come — finally come for the sake of the people of Israel and the families [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=332.76s)]
*  waiting in agony. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=338.08s)]
*  And for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=340.08s)]
*  because of the war. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=344.88s)]
*  The Palestinian people have gone through hell. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=346.68s)]
*  Too many innocent people have died. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=350.44s)]
*  Too many communities have been destroyed. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  In this deal, the people of Gaza can finally recover and rebuild. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=354.8s)]
*  They can look to a future without Hamas in power. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=361.12s)]
*  You know, the Bible says, blessed are the peacemakers. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=364.0s)]
*  Many peacemakers helped make this deal happen, including an extraordinary team of American [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=368.88s)]
*  diplomats who have worked nonstop for months to get this done. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=374.68s)]
*  Secretary Blinken led the effort. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=380.68s)]
*  Secretary Jake Sullivan — and that's the security adviser Jake Sullivan. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=383.24s)]
*  Bill Burns, John Fiennes, Brett McGurk, Amos Hochstein, and the Vice President worked [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  relentlessly as we worked to deliver this deal. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=392.44s)]
*  I'd also note this deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=397.48s)]
*  terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=404.12s)]
*  In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=408.40000000000003s)]
*  This has been time of real turmoil in the Middle East. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=414.08s)]
*  But as I prepare to leave office, our friends are strong, our enemies are weak, and there's [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=417.48s)]
*  a genuine opportunity for a new future. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=423.76s)]
*  In Lebanon, there's an opportunity for a future free from the grip of Hezbollah. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=426.88s)]
*  In Syria, a future free from the tyranny of Assad. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=432.56s)]
*  And for the Palestinian people, a credible — a credible pathway to a state of their [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=436.36s)]
*  own. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=441.56s)]
*  And for the region, a future of normalization and integration of Israel and all its Arab [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=442.56s)]
*  neighbors, including Saudi Arabia. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=448.8s)]
*  With the G20 in Delhi in September 23, I rallied key countries behind a vision of an [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=452.4s)]
*  economic corridor from India across the Middle East to Europe. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=458.0s)]
*  That vision can now become a reality. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=463.08s)]
*  There are risks as well, including ISIS in Iran, even in a badly weakened state. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  But — but — we're handing off to the next team a real opportunity for a better [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=471.03999999999996s)]
*  future for the Middle East. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=476.53999999999996s)]
*  I hope they will take it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=478.44s)]
*  Let me close with this. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=479.76s)]
*  My friend for years in the United States Senate, former Senator George Mitchell, who did so [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=482.8s)]
*  much to forge peace in Northern Ireland once said — about diplomacy, said, it is a 700 [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=487.6s)]
*  days of failure and one day of success. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  700 days of failure and one day of success. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=497.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, we've had many difficult days since the mosque began its terrible war. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=500.8s)]
*  We've encountered roadblocks and setbacks. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  We've not given up. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=507.76s)]
*  And now, after more than 14 — 400 days of struggle, a day of success has arrived. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=510.24s)]
*  God bless all the hostages and their families. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=516.96s)]
*  May God protect the troops of all those who work for peace. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=519.56s)]
*  Q Mr. President, how do you see the future of Gaza now? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=523.56s)]
*  As you were saying, the implementation of this deal will be in the hands of the next [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=528.56s)]
*  administration, and basically they will shape the future of Gaza. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=532.16s)]
*  So how do you see this future? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=536.28s)]
*  And also, how much credit do you give to the Trump team for this deal? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=538.48s)]
*  Trump is already taking credit for this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=542.76s)]
*  Well, you know, this is the exact framework of the deal I proposed back in May. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  Exact. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=552.32s)]
*  And we got the world to endorse it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  Secondly, it's America's support for Israel that helped them badly weaken the mosque and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=558.76s)]
*  backers and create the conditions for this deal. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  And thirdly, I knew this deal would have to be implemented by the next team, so I told [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=570.4s)]
*  my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we're all speaking with [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOAlULVM3HQ&t=577.3199999999999s)]
