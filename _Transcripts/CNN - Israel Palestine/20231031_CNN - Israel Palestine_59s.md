*  Can you just kind of walk me through what led to this decision for you to resign? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes, I have worked in the Bureau of Political Military Affairs for over 11 years. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=3.92s)]
*  This is the bureau responsible for arms transfers to partners around the world. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=7.76s)]
*  I have never seen a circumstance before in which there is a clear risk of civilian casualties [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=12.0s)]
*  resulting from US arms transfers. And in fact, we are seeing that manifesting on the ground with [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=17.2s)]
*  thousands of Palestinian civilian casualties. And yet no questions asked, not even a debate [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=21.76s)]
*  about whether or not we should provide the arms that are being used to commit those, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=27.36s)]
*  I believe, human rights violations, but certainly to kill those civilians. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=32.32s)]
*  So faced with the massive scope of the crisis that we are seeing in Gaza, the massive scope [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=35.76s)]
*  of civilian casualties. The fact that I also believe that the policy has not led to peace [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=42.56s)]
*  for Israel or for Palestinians. It has been a dead end policy. And but absent the ability to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=48.4s)]
*  have even a discussion about that before shipping arms, I felt I had to resign. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTUjvqJ20E&t=54.72s)]
