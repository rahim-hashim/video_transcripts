# Israeli military analyst: The legitimization window is closing quickly the longer Israel waits
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA)
*  We begin with team coverage this hour across Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=0.0s)]
*  Erin Burnett in Tel Aviv starts our coverage off. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=2.48s)]
*  Erin, that's quite a claim by President Herzog. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=4.84s)]
*  What are the implications? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Well, the implications, obviously, significant. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=11.0s)]
*  Now, let's just go through exactly what they say they found, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=13.76s)]
*  Apoopi. They say they found a USB [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=16.48s)]
*  on one of the Hamas militants involved in the attacks. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=18.28s)]
*  And on that USB, there was information [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=21.32s)]
*  from what had been an Al-Qaeda 2003 operational manual, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=23.72s)]
*  which included a page of instructions [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=28.22s)]
*  on how to assemble a cyanide chemical weapon [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=29.9s)]
*  and how to disperse it with crude drawings. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=34.58s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=37.06s)]
*  They are, however, clear that there was no indications, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=38.22s)]
*  at least we've received no indication [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=42.42s)]
*  from the Israeli government, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=44.14s)]
*  that there were any plans to deploy such a weapon. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=45.099999999999994s)]
*  It's just that it was on that USB. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=47.26s)]
*  But we do know that there were battle plans [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  found on operatives as well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=50.7s)]
*  We've seen those ourselves that go through each of the kibbutzim [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=52.34s)]
*  which were attacked street by street where every camera was, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=56.54s)]
*  every generator was, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  an incredible amount of detailed information. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=60.42s)]
*  And on those plans, we do know, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=62.3s)]
*  talking to security at least one kibbutz, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=64.46s)]
*  that they followed those to the tee [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=67.26s)]
*  and went item by item by item. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=68.7s)]
*  So the significance of the chemical weapons cannot be, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=70.66s)]
*  you know, we can't miss that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=73.9s)]
*  But there is no indication as of yet [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=75.38s)]
*  that there was any plan to use any such weapon. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=77.02s)]
*  Erin, the barrage of airstrikes overnight, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=80.46000000000001s)]
*  I believe 320 targets is what the IDF is saying. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=82.34s)]
*  What are you seeing and hearing this morning? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=85.5s)]
*  All right, so 320 airstrikes, they give out numbers most days. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=89.54s)]
*  So just over two days that you're running at a 500 strike [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=93.14s)]
*  over 48 hour period. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=96.3s)]
*  That gives you a sense of what's happening in Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=98.1s)]
*  Now, the Palestinian health authority there is saying that, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=100.06s)]
*  for example, near Rafa, the border crossing, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=103.7s)]
*  that there were four strikes there in individual homes [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=105.66s)]
*  and that 29 people were killed. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=107.42s)]
*  That's what they say, impossible to verify. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=108.98s)]
*  But it does speak to something. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=111.34s)]
*  Both sides are actually agreeing on, even if not explicitly, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  which is that the Israeli strikes are extremely targeted. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=117.22s)]
*  So targeting specific homes where they believe [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=120.1s)]
*  that there are links to Hamas militants. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=122.22s)]
*  They're also talking about Islamic Jihad. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=126.34s)]
*  Israel is that they are including Palestinian Islamic Jihad [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=128.3s)]
*  targets as legitimate in Gaza, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=131.3s)]
*  in addition to Hamas themselves. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=133.38s)]
*  This morning, and we'll get to Nick in a moment to hear more, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=135.42000000000002s)]
*  there have been days where we have heard that assault [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=138.5s)]
*  even from Tel Aviv, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=140.86s)]
*  certainly when we're closer in Ashkelon, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=141.7s)]
*  we hear the back and forth, you can hear artillery. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  Here we do hear often the thuds of those bombs. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=145.94s)]
*  And it has been very quiet today. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=148.7s)]
*  It has been very quiet yesterday, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=150.26s)]
*  at least from where we're standing at the beginning. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=152.17999999999998s)]
*  Two weeks ago when I was here, it was a constant thud [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  that you could actually physically feel through your body [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=158.26s)]
*  throughout the day. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=160.57999999999998s)]
*  We are not hearing that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=161.5s)]
*  So that is different. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=163.17999999999998s)]
*  And there are those thousands of troops mastal on the border [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=164.54s)]
*  waiting for the green light to go in, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  all up along that 25 mile long border. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=169.1s)]
*  Israeli officials, of course, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=172.62s)]
*  have been warning about this for days, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=173.62s)]
*  but the question now remains when exactly it will happen. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=175.5s)]
*  And we do understand that the Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=178.7s)]
*  obviously has been presented with many possible operations [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  that he could, green light, they could go on. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=185.1s)]
*  So we'll see whether this weight indicates a shift [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=187.46s)]
*  in his decision-making on what going in entails. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=190.22s)]
*  Nick Robertson, as Phil said, has insta-wrote Israel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=194.1s)]
*  And Nick, what are you seeing where you are this morning? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=196.82s)]
*  Yeah, by far the heaviest amount of airstrikes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=202.42s)]
*  that we've witnessed here in the past two weeks, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=205.26s)]
*  overnight last night, the late evening hours [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=207.62s)]
*  into the early morning hours, really heavy bombardment, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=210.66s)]
*  shaking this house, the most sustained amount of missiles [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=214.1s)]
*  and artillery that we've experienced here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=218.7s)]
*  And we've been here for two weeks. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=221.18s)]
*  Today, as you say, much quieter. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=224.1s)]
*  We hear drones in the sky, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=227.1s)]
*  but no sounds of impacts here in northern Gaza. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=228.66s)]
*  And one of the things that we're hearing as well [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=231.9s)]
*  is the reason that the government here is so, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=233.86s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=237.58s)]
*  is so concerned about the humanitarian pauses. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=239.14000000000001s)]
*  They think that that will be used by Hamas [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=242.62s)]
*  to gain an advantage, to alleviate some of the pressure [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=245.26s)]
*  that they're facing at the moment, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=248.82s)]
*  and this pressure designed to help move along [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=250.22s)]
*  with the hostage releases. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=253.45999999999998s)]
*  Talking to some of the troops who are close to the front here, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  they talk about being told to be ready for action [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=257.82s)]
*  and then action not coming and sort of stood up, stood down. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=261.3s)]
*  But speaking to past veterans of wars here, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=264.5s)]
*  they say, look, we've been through this here before. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=267.34s)]
*  We can stay out and do this in the field as long as we like. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=269.94s)]
*  But when you look at the troops arrayed [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=275.14s)]
*  in the front lines close to Gaza, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=277.34s)]
*  that's a force waiting to go. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  Bristling with battle-ready troops, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=284.42s)]
*  farmers' fields north of Gaza churn with the controlled fury [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=287.1s)]
*  of a nation readying for an incursion to strike Hamas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=292.02000000000004s)]
*  Yet they are waiting with no explanation why. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  It feels like the early rush for battle readiness has passed. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=300.5s)]
*  The troops are deployed standing by. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=305.02000000000004s)]
*  The question is, how long can they be kept out here? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=308.14s)]
*  According to former IDF general Israel Ziv, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  as long as is needed, there are military gains. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=315.38s)]
*  We are now improving our intelligence [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=319.02000000000004s)]
*  and our capacity of targets. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=322.46000000000004s)]
*  But the political calculation here is more complicated. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=326.46000000000004s)]
*  I think both in Washington and in Jerusalem, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=331.42s)]
*  they understand that the legitimation, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=334.42s)]
*  legitimization window is closing quickly. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=338.94s)]
*  Civilian losses in Gaza are growing, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=343.7s)]
*  more than a third of them children, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=348.26s)]
*  according to Palestinian health officials. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=350.54s)]
*  Lengthy negotiations have led to two American hostages released [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  as a tiny amount of humanitarian aid has crossed into Gaza [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=358.66s)]
*  that Israel fears ends up in Hamas's hands. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=363.58000000000004s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's calculus [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=367.26000000000005s)]
*  of when to send in ground troops has never been so fraught [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=370.54s)]
*  under pressure from the White House for more hostage releases. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=375.3s)]
*  Netanyahu is in real problem. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=379.54s)]
*  He cannot say no to Biden, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=383.22s)]
*  but he cannot say yes to the humanitarian aid [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=386.94000000000005s)]
*  that drifts into northern Gaza. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=392.14000000000004s)]
*  But he is also under pressure at home too. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=396.62s)]
*  Military and others hawkish for a decisive blow against Hamas. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=399.9s)]
*  We are finishing preparing, you know, the ground force [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=404.82s)]
*  because we've changed plans. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=410.66s)]
*  We are going to for heavy maneuvering. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=414.18s)]
*  Netanyahu's dilemma compounded by his dependence [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=417.54s)]
*  on American weapons. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=421.7s)]
*  The pressure is from Washington is real, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=423.66s)]
*  is real and strong. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=427.78000000000003s)]
*  And the prime minister says many times to his ministers, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=429.82s)]
*  listen, we are getting from the United States more than you know. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=439.74s)]
*  Where less than a week ago, these fields were teeming with tanks, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=445.42s)]
*  troops making last minute repairs. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=449.82s)]
*  Today, there are just tracks in the sand. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=453.02000000000004s)]
*  There's a soldier's jacket here, bread in a bag on the table. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=456.74s)]
*  The question is, where have all the tanks gone? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=460.86s)]
*  Forward for an incursion or back to base for a pause? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  Close to the front line in Gaza these days, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=468.98s)]
*  more questions than answers. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=471.98s)]
*  An incursion still highly probable. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=474.66s)]
*  But when? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=477.42s)]
*  And while we've just been standing here over the last few minutes, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=478.42s)]
*  we've heard small arms fire, gunfire coming from this direction over here, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=484.26s)]
*  which is the direction towards the border. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=488.94s)]
*  And from here, we can't tell what is actually happening there. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=493.06s)]
*  But I think it's indicative of the tensions along the border fence at the moment. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=496.5s)]
*  Nick, absolutely. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=502.66s)]
*  But here's the thing, I know you're saying that troops are telling you they can wait indefinitely, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=503.74s)]
*  and I would expect them, you know, you'd expect them to say that regardless of the situation. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=506.94s)]
*  But this reporting that the US is exerting pressure on Netanyahu to wait. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=511.86s)]
*  Obviously, that makes a lot of sense. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=516.3s)]
*  But how long can he wait? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=518.82s)]
*  And does Netanyahu lose his position of sort of strength and authority [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=520.5s)]
*  by appearing to cave to US interests on the timing of what he does? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=523.7s)]
*  You know, I think that part of the calculus for Prime Minister Netanyahu will be [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=531.34s)]
*  what do his enemies in the region perceive if the United States and the international community [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=535.2199999999999s)]
*  is able to tell Israel not to go after Hamas, then for many Israelis, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=539.66s)]
*  that's going to ultimately look like a sign of weakness. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=544.62s)]
*  And the calculus will be, well, what will Hezbollah do knowing that, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=547.4599999999999s)]
*  knowing that they are potentially about and have threatened to launch attacks [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=551.5799999999999s)]
*  against Israel on that scale if the IDF goes into Gaza? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=557.7399999999999s)]
*  So I think that all becomes part of the calculus, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=562.98s)]
*  the calculus that Israelis themselves genuinely don't feel safe [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=565.2600000000001s)]
*  after those barbaric attacks by Hamas more than two weeks ago. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=568.94s)]
*  All that is part of the calculus. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=572.6600000000001s)]
*  Look, I think he can hold back for a while, but I think everyone's poised as an expectation. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=574.22s)]
*  But it's but I think it then becomes a question. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=579.1400000000001s)]
*  What precisely is the incursion going to do? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=581.82s)]
*  How big will it be? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=586.2600000000001s)]
*  How many civilians will be in the way of that incursion? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=587.58s)]
*  You know, I think, you know, those are the points. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=592.2199999999999s)]
*  But when it comes back to how long can they wait, one veteran of the 1967 war, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=595.02s)]
*  the Arab-Israeli war back then said, look, we were held out in the desert for a month. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=600.02s)]
*  And what we did was we trained and we practiced. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=605.78s)]
*  And he said, actually, that worked to our advantage. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=607.8599999999999s)]
*  So I think the psyche here, it's not just soldiers will tell you what they think [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=610.8199999999999s)]
*  you want to hear and what their commanders want you to hear. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=614.8599999999999s)]
*  You know, I think the psyche is what it takes will do. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqqtQV5cMA&t=618.2199999999999s)]
