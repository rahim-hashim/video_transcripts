# In rare announcement, US says guided missile sub has arrived in Middle East
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ)
*  The U.S. is using a submarine to send a message to Iran to stay out of Israel's war against Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. Central Command posted this photo of a guided-missile submarine apparently heading [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=6.0s)]
*  through the Suez Canal. That sub contains up to 154 extremely powerful Tomahawk cruise missiles [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=10.32s)]
*  on board. It is very rare for the Pentagon to reveal anything about the locations of its missile [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=16.4s)]
*  subs. Telling the world that this sub is now in the region is a clear message to Iran and its proxies [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=21.52s)]
*  to leave Israel alone. So let's bring in CNN Pentagon correspondent Orin Lieberman with more [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=27.44s)]
*  on this. So despite being forthcoming about these additional reinforcements, Orin, we continue to [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  see an increase in the number of attacks against U.S. forces in the region. Most believe that they [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=38.8s)]
*  are at the hands of Iranian proxies. So what does that say about the type of deterrence the U.S. is [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  using right now? Correct. So let's deal with both of those separately. First, there's the issue of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=53.52s)]
*  the submarine, a guided-missile submarine, an Ohio-class heading through the Suez Canal there, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=57.92s)]
*  and that joins a list of U.S. forces, certainly naval forces, already in the region. Two carrier [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  strike groups, an amphibious ready group. That's more than 10,000 sailors right there alone, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=67.84s)]
*  as well as that submarine. The Navy and the Pentagon are normally very secretive about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=73.28s)]
*  submarine operations. So when you see them surface, it is very much a statement, as it is the case here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  The Ohio-class sub transiting through what appears to be the Suez Canal there, a message very much to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=83.36s)]
*  Iran and its proxies. But they have not been silent either. The U.S. has attributed many of the attacks, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=88.4s)]
*  and we've seen 38 since October 17th against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. Many of those attributed [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=93.76s)]
*  to or blamed on Iran and its proxies in the region. Most of those have been carried out by suicide [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=100.24s)]
*  drones, one-way attack drones, or rocket attacks. There have been about 20 minor injuries to U.S. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=105.92s)]
*  forces. The vast majority of those attacks were intercepted by essentially defensive measures at [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=111.84s)]
*  the U.S. facilities and U.S. positions in Iraq and Syria. But the barrage has kept up at a fairly [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=117.44s)]
*  steady pace. These are not large barrages. These are almost sort of ones and twos when it comes to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=123.28s)]
*  rockets and drones. But they are still significant because that message of deterrence clearly not [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  getting through to the extent that it's supposed to, or at least to the extent that the Pentagon [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=133.6s)]
*  wants it to. So this is something the U.S. is keeping a very close eye on. Do these [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=137.12s)]
*  militias in Iraq and Syria try to get more involved? Do they up the pressure [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=141.76s)]
*  and up the attacks on U.S. forces? That is something the Pentagon is watching very closely, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=145.68s)]
*  Biana. This is getting word now that President Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=150.24s)]
*  Netanyahu this morning to discuss the latest developments in Israel and its war on Hamas. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=154.72s)]
*  CNN Pentagon correspondent, Orin Lieberman, thank you. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=160.0s)]
*  ORIN LIBERMAN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, CNN, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=162.32s)]
*  All right. I want to turn now to Israel's war against Hamas because what we saw over the weekend [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=166.16s)]
*  may indeed have been one of Israel's heaviest bombardments of Gaza. Yeah, the war-torn territory [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=170.56s)]
*  really getting pommelled overnight, both in the air and on the ground as well. The idea for saying [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=177.04s)]
*  that it has cut off the northern part of the enclave from the south, effectively splitting [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=183.04s)]
*  Gaza into two parts and warning that its forces will continue to attack the enclave with strength. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=188.56s)]
*  Israel is urging civilians to escape to the south in order to avoid the airstrikes, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=195.68s)]
*  but many say there is just nowhere safe to run. The death toll throughout Gaza is skyrocketing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=200.24s)]
*  The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health says there are more than 10,000 Palestinians who have been [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=205.6s)]
*  killed since the war began last month, most of them women and children. The U.S. secretary of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  state, meantime wrapping up a whirlwind diplomatic tour in the region earlier. He's been on these [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=215.04s)]
*  trips so many times in the past few weeks, but before leaving Turkey, Antony Blinken underscored [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=221.04s)]
*  the importance of protecting all civilian lives. We know the deep concern here for the terrible [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=225.68s)]
*  toll that Gaza is taking on Palestinians, on men, women and children in Gaza, innocent civilians, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=235.76s)]
*  a concern that we share and that we're working on every single day. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=242.96s)]
*  We've engaged the Israelis on steps that they can take to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=247.76s)]
*  All right, Siena's Jeremy Diamond joins us live now from Sirot in southern Israel. Jeremy, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=254.24s)]
*  it is highly likely that the IDF is going to be officially entering Gaza City in the coming days. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=258.4s)]
*  Just walk us through how the IDF expects that Hamas is actually preparing for that moment. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=264.32s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, Israeli Foreign Minister Well, there's no question that the Israeli [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=269.68s)]
*  military has prepared for the fact that Hamas has been reinforcing its positions inside of Gaza City, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=273.2s)]
*  which is Hamas' stronghold in northern Gaza. And over the weekend when I was inside Gaza with [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=279.44s)]
*  Israeli forces, it was very clear that even though they say they have cut off northern from southern [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=285.6s)]
*  Gaza, the commanders on the ground were very clear to me that they understand that Hamas still [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=291.68s)]
*  maintains extensive tunnel capabilities below ground that allows their fighters to flow from [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=296.32s)]
*  north to south and that also presents a danger to those forces in the for potential ambushes by Hamas [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=301.44s)]
*  fighters. And there is nowhere that Hamas has more tunneling capabilities, it appears, than inside [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=309.12s)]
*  the densely populated urban areas of Gaza City. As of yet, Israel is forced to say that they have [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=314.32s)]
*  encircled that city, that they have cut off northern from southern Gaza. But what they have [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=320.4s)]
*  yet to do is go deep into Gaza City to engage in what will be the prospect of very bloody, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=324.88s)]
*  deadly combat in a very urban and dense environment. But what Israel has been doing [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=331.84s)]
*  to prepare for the possibility of a significant ground incursion into Gaza City is it has been [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=337.68s)]
*  pummeling northern Gaza with airstrikes. Overnight, 450 targets were struck by Israel's military. We [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=343.52s)]
*  watched last night as many of those strikes were taking place, very bright flashes of light, very [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=350.56s)]
*  loud booms. And we're watching once again as night has fallen here, as those strikes have resumed [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=356.48s)]
*  with quite a significant intensity. Last night, what we also saw was communications in Gaza being [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=362.64s)]
*  effectively shut down. Some of those have resumed today, but it was notable to see that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=371.44s)]
*  communications have typically been shut down at very significant moments in Israel's campaign [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=376.48s)]
*  against Gaza. So we will see whether Israel decides to actually go deep into Gaza City. Clearly, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  they have encircled the area. They say that they are establishing a corridor for civilians to flee [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=388.72s)]
*  from north to south. We know that in the past, that has not always been a 100% guarantee or close to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=393.20000000000005s)]
*  it of safety for those civilians. And so a lot remains to be seen as Israel's military campaign [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=398.56s)]
*  develops in the coming days. Yeah, a lot of the civilians in the north simply have nowhere to go, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=404.56s)]
*  even though they have been told to head south. Jeremy Diamondleif for us there. Thank you so much. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYOrk2tpKaQ&t=409.36s)]
