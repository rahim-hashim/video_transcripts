# Former US General says it will be 'exceedingly difficult' to destroy Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro)
*  In his almost four-decade-long military career, retired General David Petraeus faced plenty [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=0.0s)]
*  of insurgencies, mainly Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=5.04s)]
*  What do his insights from an extraordinary career tell us about this new war between [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=8.76s)]
*  Israel and Hamas? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=13.42s)]
*  David Petraeus joins me now alongside the historian Andrew Roberts. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=14.96s)]
*  The two are co-authors of the new book Conflict, The Evolution of Warfare, from 1945 to Ukraine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=19.18s)]
*  Andrew is of course now Baron Roberts of Belgravia, having been elevated to the peerage. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=26.4s)]
*  Dave, let me start with you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=31.96s)]
*  This issue of destroying Hamas, is that a realistic goal? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  I think it is a realistic goal, but it's going to be exceedingly difficult. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=39.36s)]
*  We've seen how long it takes to clear cities roughly the size of Gaza City, nine months [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  for the Iraqi security forces to clear the Islamic State out of Mosul, as an example, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  much better, much more capable, but still it's going to be very, very tough. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=55.12s)]
*  And how they do it is very important. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=59.4s)]
*  Again, we had a question on the wall always, will this operation take more bad guys off [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=61.72s)]
*  the street than it creates by its conduct? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=66.12s)]
*  And you've got to be careful that the answer to that is going to be yes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=68.88s)]
*  And there has to also be a vision for the future. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=72.6s)]
*  They can accomplish this mission, but then keep in mind that the definition of destroy [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  in military doctrinal terms is rendered the enemy incapable of accomplishing his mission [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=81.16s)]
*  without reconstitution. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=85.84s)]
*  So whatever it is that follows has to ensure that this cannot be reconstituted. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=87.8s)]
*  Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad will try to come back. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=92.52s)]
*  So whatever it is that takes over from the Israelis, and they have to determine that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  urgently. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=99.96s)]
*  Ehud Barak was absolutely right on that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=100.96s)]
*  But they're not going to just do humanitarian assistance or reconstruction. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=104.0s)]
*  a counter-insurgency campaign to keep Hamas and the Islamic Jihad from coming back. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=108.4s)]
*  When you did the surge, one of the things that seemed to me so successful in that post-operation [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=113.68s)]
*  was you brokered a reconciliation between the Sunnis and the Shias politically. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=119.18s)]
*  So I mean, do you need some kind of political vision? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=128.16s)]
*  There has to be a vision for the people in Gaza, for the Palestinians, that distinguishes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=129.16s)]
*  very clearly. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=134.78s)]
*  The war is not on them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=135.78s)]
*  It's actually to make their lives better. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=136.78s)]
*  If they will reject Hamas, their life will be better. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=138.86s)]
*  By the way, the same for those in the West Bank. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=142.42s)]
*  There has to be that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=144.86s)]
*  And again, what we did is we said to the Sunnis, if you'll break with al-Qaeda in Iraq, support [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=145.86s)]
*  us first and then the government. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=150.26s)]
*  And then later, the same with the Iranian-supported Shia militia, let's strip you away. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=152.14s)]
*  And of course, we defeated then the other elements, the militia that remained, and also [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=156.66s)]
*  al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Sunni insurgent groups. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  So that vision is crucial. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=164.6s)]
*  And again, I think Ehud Barak had that exactly right as well. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=166.92s)]
*  A quick thought on Hezbollah before I go. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=170.56s)]
*  Do you think Hezbollah will launch a serious attack from the north? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=174.72s)]
*  I don't think they want to do that, but the pressure will grow as the damage and destruction. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=178.72s)]
*  Inevitably, there are going to be civilian casualties. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=183.84s)]
*  Urban combat is fiendishly difficult. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=186.32s)]
*  And I can't imagine a context that is more difficult than this one. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=188.76s)]
*  So that's going to be very, very challenging for them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=193.96s)]
*  And again, you have to have this vision that's going to try to separate the people from Hamas, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=208.2s)]
*  again, also in the West Bank as well. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=214.0s)]
*  Hezbollah, though, got hammered in 2006, much worse than we realized at the time we reassessed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=217.08s)]
*  at several occasions. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=223.34s)]
*  They'll do the occasional attacks and all the rest of that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=224.82s)]
*  I don't think they want to launch all 150,000 rockets, which would be devastating for Israel, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=227.78s)]
*  but then would be even more devastating for Hezbollah. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=233.06s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=235.5s)]
*  And could I just add that operationally, of course, it's also very good for Israel to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=236.5s)]
*  be able to promise the Palestinian Arabs that they will be able to go back to Gaza, because [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=241.42s)]
*  then you could physically also separate them from the Hamas that you're trying to fight [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=245.98s)]
*  in Gaza City. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=250.82s)]
*  That's in history that bears that out. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=251.66s)]
*  Historically, you talk about Malaysia as being one of the great successors of counterinsurgency. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=254.29999999999998s)]
*  What do you draw as the key lesson to succeeding in a counterinsurgency? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=259.94s)]
*  Well the way that Malaysia worked is that they were able to offer the people independence. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=263.86s)]
*  Malaysia became independent in 1957, and that was immensely important in winning what was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=268.38s)]
*  said at the time to be the hearts and minds. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=273.9s)]
*  That phrase was coined in that campaign. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  That was the phrase, yes, exactly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=278.3s)]
*  They matter, and they matter here as well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=279.62s)]
*  And Sir Gerald Templer coined that phrase, and it worked. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=281.66s)]
*  And it wasn't just in Malaysia. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=286.22s)]
*  It also worked in the Oman campaign, where they were able to offer progress, actual physical, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=287.38s)]
*  educational, agricultural, medical progress. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=293.46s)]
*  And that's also something that obviously could be an important part to play here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnlI0ToSnro&t=297.22s)]
