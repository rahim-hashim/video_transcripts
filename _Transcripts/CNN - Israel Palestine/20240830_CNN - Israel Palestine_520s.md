# 'Soap has become a luxury item': Aid official describes anguish in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI)
*  Former CNN war correspondent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=0.0s)]
*  Arwa Damon has been to the [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=1.78s)]
*  enclave three times during this [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=3.24s)]
*  war with her charity, Inara. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=4.84s)]
*  And she says that each trip [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=7.18s)]
*  reveals that there is, quote, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  less aid and more need. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=9.68s)]
*  I reached her this week from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=11.74s)]
*  Daryl Bala on the Gaza coast. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=13.08s)]
*  Arwa Damon, welcome back to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=16.42s)]
*  the program from Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=17.82s)]
*  Thank you for having me on. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=20.22s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=21.32s)]
*  Well, last time you were here [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=22.02s)]
*  after one of your trips, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=23.36s)]
*  you were in the studio, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=24.46s)]
*  and you said, essentially, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=25.36s)]
*  you know, things just get [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=27.36s)]
*  exponentially worse. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=29.1s)]
*  I asked you last time how it [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=30.26s)]
*  was. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=31.340000000000003s)]
*  What is it like this time [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=32.46s)]
*  compared to when you were last [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=34.2s)]
*  there? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=35.9s)]
*  It's sorrow that is eclipsing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=36.9s)]
*  any kind of sorrow I've seen [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=39.84s)]
*  before. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=41.08s)]
*  It's misery beyond the scope [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=41.58s)]
*  of misery. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=42.92s)]
*  It's less humanitarian [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  assistance, less ability to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=46.08s)]
*  support those who are in need, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=47.82s)]
*  and an increasingly growing [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=49.36s)]
*  population that extends to just [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=51.260000000000005s)]
*  about every single human being [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=52.92s)]
*  in this wretched stretch of land [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  who cannot cope with even the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=58.72s)]
*  most basic of things. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Christiane, we international [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=62.419999999999995s)]
*  aid organizations and local [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=64.82s)]
*  ones have been reduced to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=66.52s)]
*  trying to advocate for [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=68.56s)]
*  something as simple as a bar [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=70.2s)]
*  of soap. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=73.0s)]
*  Honestly, Arwa, it's terrible [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=74.14s)]
*  to hear you say that, and I [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=76.78s)]
*  know you tweeted that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=78.17999999999999s)]
*  Just explain what you mean by [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  that and what difference in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=80.78s)]
*  life and death would soap make [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=83.17999999999999s)]
*  right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=84.88s)]
*  So, the bare bones of it is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=86.22s)]
*  that access to soap and the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=87.8s)]
*  ability to maintain a certain [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=89.54s)]
*  level of hygiene reduces the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=90.84s)]
*  spread of disease by 40%. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=92.78s)]
*  What we are seeing right now is [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=95.18s)]
*  a significant increase in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=96.98s)]
*  diseases like hepatitis A. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=98.54s)]
*  I went down to Nasdaq Hospital [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=100.62s)]
*  and the head of the pediatric [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=102.18s)]
*  department there told me that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=103.26s)]
*  two children a week are dying [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=104.42s)]
*  just in that hospital because [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=106.72s)]
*  of hepatitis A. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=108.56s)]
*  It also means meningitis is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=110.36s)]
*  spreading. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=112.5s)]
*  It also means that this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=113.0s)]
*  horrific skin disease called [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=114.44s)]
*  hepatitis A, which is especially [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=116.52s)]
*  prevalent in children and highly [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=119.02s)]
*  contagious and can potentially [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=120.72s)]
*  be lethal because if left [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=123.06s)]
*  untreated it can lead to kidney [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=124.56s)]
*  failure, which can lead to death, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=126.0s)]
*  is also all over the place. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=127.84s)]
*  These are all diseases that can [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=129.54s)]
*  be controlled, which in return [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=132.04s)]
*  would empty up bed space in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=133.84s)]
*  these hospitals to be able to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=135.44s)]
*  deal with the catastrophic [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=137.34s)]
*  injuries that they're getting [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=138.64s)]
*  from the bomb blasts. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=139.58s)]
*  But there's no soap. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=141.18s)]
*  We go into these camps and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=143.28s)]
*  families are begging us for soap. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=145.18s)]
*  What do they use instead of soap? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=147.82s)]
*  Well, one family I spoke to said [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=149.57999999999998s)]
*  that they were going down to the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=151.16s)]
*  beach, getting sand, mixing it [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=152.32s)]
*  with a little bit of salt and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  lemon, and that's how they've [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=155.66s)]
*  been cleaning themselves for the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=156.92s)]
*  last five months. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=158.76s)]
*  So if a ceasefire, which we've [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=160.0s)]
*  all been advocating for to be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=161.7s)]
*  able to get more humanitarian [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=163.26s)]
*  aid and obviously hasn't [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=164.7s)]
*  materialized for the last 10 [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=166.54s)]
*  months, we are now trying to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=168.24s)]
*  simplify it down to soap. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=170.24s)]
*  Oh, my goodness, I mean, that's [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=172.28s)]
*  really awful to hear you say [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=173.9s)]
*  that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=175.3s)]
*  And I just need to say, because [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  there's a report that actually, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=178.76s)]
*  where you are, I think near [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=180.86s)]
*  Debala, right, there's the coast [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=182.44s)]
*  there is apparently showing up [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=184.9s)]
*  all brown and murky because of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  massive sewage spills. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=189.14000000000001s)]
*  So these people are going there [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=191.44s)]
*  also to try to get clean, but [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=192.58s)]
*  there's not even clean seawater. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  And, Christiane, what people [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=196.62s)]
*  don't realize when they hear [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  about evacuation orders is, yes, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  we are very familiar with that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=200.82s)]
*  horrendous image of people just [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  carrying what they can, but each [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  evacuation order impacts [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=205.96s)]
*  organizations' ability to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=207.9s)]
*  distribute and produce safe, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  clean water. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=212.54000000000002s)]
*  So the most recent evacuation [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=213.3s)]
*  orders over the last two weeks [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=214.98000000000002s)]
*  from Debala and Khan Yunis [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=216.98000000000002s)]
*  reduced the population's access [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  to clean water by 70 percent. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=221.12s)]
*  So that has already had an [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=224.38000000000002s)]
*  impact on what people are going [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=226.82000000000002s)]
*  through. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=228.46s)]
*  But if we extrapolate beyond [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=229.08s)]
*  that and look at what's happening [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=230.96s)]
*  in the ICUs, I was in the ICU at [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=232.26s)]
*  El Aqsa Hospital. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=234.56s)]
*  There's a 13-year-old boy with [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=235.6s)]
*  severe burn injuries. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=237.1s)]
*  He is in the ICU because he has [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=239.04s)]
*  a blood infection and signs of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=241.68s)]
*  early sepsis because there [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=243.24s)]
*  weren't enough bandages to be [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=244.52s)]
*  able to keep his wounds [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=246.24s)]
*  properly clean. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=247.38s)]
*  There is a little year and a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=248.48s)]
*  half old girl who is not [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=249.96s)]
*  stabilizing from her catastrophic [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=252.82s)]

*  her size. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=261.02s)]
*  Now, we were luckily able to [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=261.72s)]
*  secure some for her and deliver [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=263.42s)]

*  But if this little girl wakes [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=266.8s)]

*  Oh, this is just so awful. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=272.40000000000003s)]
*  We hear about the huge number of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=274.44000000000005s)]

*  Apparently, a 10-month-old baby [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=283.98s)]
*  was partially paralyzed. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=285.28000000000003s)]

*  apparently, they're trying to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=291.72s)]
*  start even in the midst of this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=292.62s)]
*  war and destruction of a [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=294.38s)]

*  Is that possible? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=298.42s)]
*  Yeah, they have to. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=299.62s)]
*  And, you know, there is movement [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=301.5s)]
*  in terms of, you know, getting [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=303.5s)]
*  a cold chain in, getting the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  vaccine in, and training of [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=307.46000000000004s)]

*  vaccine. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=310.48s)]
*  The plan is on the table, but [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=311.0s)]
*  the plan absolutely, 100%, cannot [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=312.3s)]
*  be implemented unless there is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=314.3s)]
*  some sort of a pause in the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=315.88s)]
*  fighting that is taking place. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=317.68s)]
*  And if that pause does not [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=319.18s)]
*  happen and if polio starts to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=320.38s)]
*  spread, we are going to start [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=321.76s)]
*  seeing and hearing more and more [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=323.46s)]
*  horrific stories of more and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=325.86s)]
*  more children ending up [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=327.4s)]
*  paralyzed of something that, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=328.46s)]

*  I do not have the words to begin [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=332.24s)]
*  to describe just how hard it is [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=334.44s)]
*  to provide people with even the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  most basic of items because [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=338.6s)]
*  things are not available. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=340.2s)]
*  I just came back from a fresh [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  vegetable distribution to a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=344.12s)]
*  couple of the shelters that we [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=346.58s)]
*  work with. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=348.44s)]
*  Some of the families, and we [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=349.5s)]
*  purchased this locally, by the [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=350.6s)]
*  way, because aid isn't really [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=351.84s)]
*  moving in, but commercial trucks [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=353.8s)]
*  are, we purchased some of these [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=355.54s)]
*  items at 20 times their original [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=357.44s)]
*  price. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=360.21999999999997s)]
*  Either way, it doesn't matter [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=360.88s)]
*  because these families had not [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=362.16s)]
*  eaten a fresh vegetable for [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=364.68s)]
*  anywhere from five months, and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=366.56s)]
*  then at best, one month was the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=369.12s)]
*  last time they had had fresh [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=371.02s)]
*  vegetable. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=372.72s)]
*  Aarwa, listen, I mean, is the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=373.46s)]
*  fighting worse now than it was [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  two, three, four months ago? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=379.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis seem to say [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=381.29999999999995s)]
*  they're busy degrading Hamas, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=382.84s)]
*  they're in these ceasefire [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=385.0s)]
*  hostage swap negotiations, and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=386.73999999999995s)]
*  yet, as you say, aid's not [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=390.28s)]
*  getting in. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=391.67999999999995s)]
*  And we can quote also this week, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=392.17999999999995s)]
*  the U.N. said humanitarian [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=394.82s)]
*  efforts ground to a halt because [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=396.44s)]
*  of new Israeli evacuation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=397.82s)]
*  orders. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=399.17999999999995s)]
*  The International Rescue [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=399.88s)]
*  Committee also had to stop aid [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  during these evacuation orders. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=402.26s)]
*  I mean, it's getting worse. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=405.08s)]
*  The international community [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=407.24s)]
*  says it's trying to get aid in, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=408.28s)]
*  but you're saying it's [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=410.34s)]
*  practically at a trickle at [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=411.08s)]
*  best. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=412.88s)]
*  It's less than a trickle. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=414.02s)]
*  It's like that tiny little drop [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=415.41999999999996s)]
*  that barely comes out of the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=417.38s)]
*  faucet. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=419.41999999999996s)]
*  And we also had to suspend our [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=419.91999999999996s)]
*  usual sort of programs and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=422.02s)]
*  activities for a few days [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  because two of our staff and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=424.56s)]
*  five of the shelters that we [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=426.29999999999995s)]
*  work with were under evacuation [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=427.4s)]
*  orders, and I myself have, you [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=429.0s)]
*  know, moved around a couple of [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=430.34s)]
*  times in the last two weeks that [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=432.14s)]
*  I've been here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=434.46s)]
*  The problem we have with aid is [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=435.8s)]
*  the same as what it was two [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=438.04s)]
*  months ago, but significantly [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=440.38s)]
*  worse. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=442.24s)]
*  We cannot access the aid that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=443.04s)]
*  Israel permits to enter, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=445.62s)]
*  Kerem Shalom, because the route [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=447.58s)]
*  that Israel designates for us to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=449.88s)]
*  use to get that aid is basically [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=452.38s)]
*  run by looters and criminal [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  gangs. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=457.12s)]
*  And Israel is not securing that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=457.71999999999997s)]
*  route, nor is it providing us [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=459.76s)]
*  with alternate routes. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=461.56s)]
*  There are alternates that exist. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=463.14s)]
*  We can use what's known as the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=465.82s)]
*  fence route, where in theory [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel had at one point stated [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=469.12s)]
*  that it would allow 40 trucks to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=471.28000000000003s)]
*  go through there, mostly trucks [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=473.16s)]
*  carrying medicine and fuel. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=474.92s)]
*  These days, on a lucky day, and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=476.46s)]
*  it's not even daily, you're [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=478.5s)]
*  getting about 18 trucks moving [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=479.8s)]
*  through there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=481.66s)]
*  Items that get into the north [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=482.66s)]
*  through Edes right now. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=484.3s)]
*  So that soap I've been talking [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=486.0s)]
*  about, those hygiene kits, they [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=487.3s)]
*  actually do get into the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=489.04s)]
*  northern part of Gaza. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=490.4s)]
*  But we are not permitted to move [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=492.09999999999997s)]
*  them from the north to the south. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=494.09999999999997s)]
*  So we can't even scale up what's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=496.7s)]
*  being sent through the north. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=500.5s)]
*  They will not give us a straight [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=501.4s)]
*  answer. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=503.2s)]
*  We do not get straight answers as [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=503.64s)]
*  to why we cannot properly move [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=505.84s)]
*  aid from the south. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=508.34s)]
*  So, for example, fresh [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcVtsq068KI&t=509.74s)]
