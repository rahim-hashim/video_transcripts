# Reporter on what he found interesting from Netanyahuâ€™s remarks
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA)
*  Citizens of Israel, a year ago we celebrated Sukkot. At the exact time, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=0.0s)]
*  Yachye Sinwah was making final preparations for the October 7 massacre. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=7.0s)]
*  I stand before you today to inform you that Yachye Sinwah has been eliminated. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=13.0s)]
*  The person who committed the most terrible massacre in the history of our nation since the Holocaust, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=20.0s)]
*  the mass murderer who murdered thousands of Israelis and kidnapped hundreds of our citizens, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=26.0s)]
*  was eliminated today by our heroic soldiers. And today, as we promised to do, we came to account with him. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=31.0s)]
*  Today, evil has suffered a heavy blow, but the task before us is not yet complete. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=38.0s)]
*  To the dear families of the hostages, I say, this is an important moment in the war. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=44.0s)]
*  We will continue with all our strength until the return home of all of your loved ones, who are our loved ones. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=50.0s)]
*  This is our highest commitment. This is my highest commitment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=57.0s)]
*  And to the resident of Gaza, I say, Sinwah ruined your life. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=62.0s)]
*  He told you he was a lion, but in reality he was hiding on a dark den, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=68.0s)]
*  and he was killed when he fled in a panic from our soldiers. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=74.0s)]
*  His elimination is an important landmark in the decline of the evil rule of Hamas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=79.0s)]
*  I would like to say again, in the clearest way, Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=84.0s)]
*  This is the beginning of the day after Hamas, and this is an opportunity for you, the resident of Gaza, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=89.0s)]
*  to finally break free from its tyranny. I call on everyone who holds our hostages. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=95.0s)]
*  I call on whoever lays down his weapon and returns our hostages, we will allow him to go out and live. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=101.0s)]
*  And in the same way I say, whoever harms our hostages, blood on his head, we will reckon with him. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=108.0s)]
*  The return of our hostages is an opportunity to achieve all our goals, and it brings the end of the war closer. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=115.0s)]
*  To the people of the regions, I say, in Gaza, in Beirut, throughout the entire region, the darkness recedes and the light rises. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=124.0s)]
*  Def, Hanir, Sinwar, Nasrallah, Mohsen, Akil, and many of their associates are gone. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=131.0s)]
*  I'm calling you, people of the region. We have a great opportunity to stop the axis of evil and create a different future, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=137.0s)]
*  a future of peace, a future of prosperity in the entire region. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=144.0s)]
*  Together we can repel the curse and promote the blessing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=149.0s)]
*  Now it is clear to everyone in Israel and in the world why we insisted on not ending the war, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=154.0s)]
*  why we did insist, in the face of all the pressures, to enter Rafa, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=161.0s)]
*  the 45th stronghold of Hamas where Sinwar and many of the murderers hid. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=166.0s)]
*  I would like to express my deep appreciation to the IDF and Shin Bet for their efforts. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=171.0s)]
*  I would like to express my deep appreciation to the IDF and Shin Bet fighters and their commanders [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=176.0s)]
*  for their determined and courageous action. There are none better than them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=181.0s)]
*  Today we clarified again what happened to those who hurt us. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=185.0s)]
*  Today we once again showed the world the victory of good over evil. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=189.0s)]
*  But the war, my dear friends, is not over yet. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=193.0s)]
*  And it is difficult, and it exacts heavy prices from us. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=197.0s)]
*  I wish to express my condolences from the bottom of my heart to the families who lost their loved ones. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=201.0s)]
*  I want to hug the families of our fallen heroes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=206.0s)]
*  Their supreme sacrifice, including the last few days, brings us closer to victory. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=209.0s)]
*  As King David said, I will pursue my enemies and destroy them, and I will not return to their end. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=215.0s)]
*  Citizens of Israel, we are in the resurrection war. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=222.0s)]
*  Big challenges are still ahead of us. We are required for long patience, for the unity of the ranks, for courage, for a firm stand. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=227.0s)]
*  Together we will fight, and with God's help, together we will win. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=237.0s)]
*  That was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking to the Israeli people and the world following confirmation of the death of the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=242.0s)]
*  There Netanyahu is saying that a mass murderer has been eliminated. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=251.0s)]
*  He said, evil has suffered a heavy blow, but the task is not complete. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=255.0s)]
*  He did vow to the families of those taken by Hamas and other outfits in Gaza on October 7th that he would return the hostages, adding that Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=260.0s)]
*  He said this is day one of a Gaza without Hamas. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=272.0s)]
*  And he said that returning the hostages would bring that region closer to the end of the war. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=275.0s)]
*  He also said now it is clear to the world, I believe he said, why Alex Marquardt, we, Israel, went into Rafa. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah, and remember that was one of the most contentious moments in this war between the Biden administration and the Israelis. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=289.0s)]
*  That's when the Biden administration held back 2,000-pound bombs because they did not want Israel to go into Rafa in ways that they had in the rest of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=295.0s)]
*  So what Netanyahu, I believe, is alluding to here is where they ended up finding and killing Yahya Sinwar, which the IDF has said was in southern Gaza. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=304.0s)]
*  He mentioned Rafa. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=314.0s)]
*  And I'm also told by a person familiar with the death of Sinwar that this did happen in or around Rafa. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=315.0s)]
*  So a bit more detail there about the final moments of Sinwar. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=323.0s)]
*  But I think what is really interesting there is we didn't hear the word ceasefire. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=328.0s)]
*  If I'm a U.S. official, I'm listening to that speech looking for indications that he may be willing to wind down this war and reach a diplomatic solution. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=333.0s)]
*  He talked about the importance of bringing home the hostages. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=341.0s)]
*  But the argument that he has made for quite some time is that it is military pressure. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=343.0s)]
*  It is the fighting that will bring those hostages home. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=347.0s)]
*  He didn't say anything about now agreeing to a ceasefire. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=349.0s)]
*  And he said that this brings us one step closer to victory. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=352.0s)]
*  And victory for him has been the eradication of Hamas. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=355.0s)]
*  He got he I was to say he actually seemed to implore individuals to give the hostages over right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=359.0s)]
*  That it was he was imploring individual Palestinians that we will give you safe passage if you turn over hostages, which is kind of difficult to see how that might play out. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=367.0s)]
*  Yeah. And part of it has to do with how Hamas will now be constituted. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=377.0s)]
*  Right. There's this open question of whether the political arm that is essentially been in Qatar now for the duration of the war, at least, and the actual military group, the sort of combat units that are in Gaza, if there might be a power struggle there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=383.0s)]
*  Netanyahu did say that this is a great opportunity to stop an axis of evil. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=400.0s)]
*  And I wonder, Alex, how does that land with folks in Gaza? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=405.0s)]
*  This idea that this is now day one of a Gaza without Hamas. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=409.0s)]
*  Is that a realistic path forward at this point? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=414.0s)]
*  There are so many facets of that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=418.0s)]
*  That terrific question, Boris. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=420.0s)]
*  And it reminds me of something that Netanyahu said last week when he basically called on the Lebanese people to cast off Hezbollah. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=421.0s)]
*  And here he's asking the Palestinians of Gaza to cast out Hamas. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=427.0s)]
*  There are a lot of Palestinians in Gaza who don't want to see Hamas in charge, who don't want to see Hamas running the Gaza Strip because of everything that they have been suffering through for the past year. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=431.0s)]
*  But when you hear Netanyahu calling on them to do that, they don't want to team up with Netanyahu on that because Netanyahu has been the one that they believe has brought so much suffering there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=444.0s)]
*  So that is likely not to go down very well. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=453.0s)]
*  It's not like the Palestinians in Gaza are going to heed this call from Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=456.0s)]
*  But there's no doubt that there is this power vacuum here and they have always had this difficult balance of power between those who are outside, those who are inside. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=460.0s)]
*  Those who are outside weren't aware of the October 7th attacks as they were unfolding or as they were about to unfold. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=470.0s)]
*  And so major questions about whether the ultimate head of Hamas is going to remain in Gaza, as it did with Yaya Sinwar. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=477.0s)]
*  Or whether someone from the political echelon outside of Gaza will take over, in which case they might be more in favor of coming to some kind of ceasefire agreement. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=485.0s)]
*  But what I took away from that Netanyahu speech is that the fight in his eyes is not yet over. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrXuXFzUjA&t=494.0s)]
