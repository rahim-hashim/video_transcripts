# 'I don't know if we're going to make it': Palestinian-American stuck in Gaza speaks out
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE)
*  More than two million Palestinians live in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=0.0s)]
*  About half of those are children. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=2.64s)]
*  Let's bring in Hanin Okal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=5.28s)]
*  She's a Palestinian American from Union County, New Jersey. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=6.88s)]
*  She is currently stuck in Gaza City with her three children. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=10.56s)]
*  They are eight, two, and a two-month-old. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=14.08s)]
*  They cannot get out. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=17.04s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=18.56s)]
*  Has the U.S. Embassy been able to give you any help to get out? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=20.8s)]
*  Hi, how are you? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  Yes, we tried to contact the U.S. Embassy so many times. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=27.6s)]
*  Unfortunately, they couldn't help us at all. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=33.04s)]
*  I contacted them through the phone, via email. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=35.52s)]
*  I texted and I called different numbers, but nobody, I couldn't hear back from any. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=38.64s)]
*  They said that we're going to call you back within 24 hours or so on, a couple hours, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=48.16s)]
*  but they couldn't at all call us or we didn't get any information from them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=54.64s)]
*  I applied, I submitted a form through the website, but that didn't work as well. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=61.04s)]
*  I don't know with what happened with areas crossing border [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=69.6s)]
*  and what was happening with the Rafah border. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=73.2s)]
*  I don't know if we're going to make it, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  but I am absolutely looking forward to the help of the U.S. Embassy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=78.16s)]
*  We are all here feeling abandoned and feeling that we're left alone. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=84.96s)]
*  So we're really looking for the U.S. Embassy to help the U.S. citizens who are living in Gaza. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=91.28s)]
*  That was just an Israeli airstrike that we just heard? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=98.4s)]
*  That was just an Israeli airstrike that we just heard? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=102.72s)]
*  A what? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  That we just heard a sound, like a bomb or a missile. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=106.48s)]
*  Is that what we just heard? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's happening 24 hours. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=111.2s)]
*  All time, they're bombing all around from south to north to the center of Gaza, everywhere. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=115.68s)]
*  Bombing is everywhere. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=125.2s)]
*  Your kids, how are they doing with that? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=126.4s)]
*  How are they doing with that? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=130.4s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=134.4s)]
*  My kids are very scared and they're afraid of what's going on. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=135.2s)]
*  I have to explain all the time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=140.0s)]
*  I have to calm them down and trying to make them feel comfortable, safe, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=142.64s)]
*  and trying to make them busy with other things so they can't feel afraid or scared. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  But they are like what happened with me, for example, today. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=156.72s)]
*  I was going trying to get out from Gaza. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=160.96s)]
*  I was going to the Rafah border. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=163.6s)]
*  And while we're going there, we tried multiple ways to get out of Gaza, going to Rafah, to the south. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=167.36s)]
*  We couldn't make it at all. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=178.4s)]
*  So my son saw all the locations destroyed, his favorite places. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=179.84s)]
*  He was shocked with what he saw. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  So we had to see all that and we had to go through what we say. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=188.48s)]
*  So it was like, you know, you're going to death. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=197.11999999999998s)]
*  There needs to be a way for you to get out. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  You're not Hamas. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  You're an innocent person and you have three kids. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  You need to be able to get out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  You heard earlier the suggestions from the IDF spokesman I spoke with Saturday night. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=211.76s)]
*  Where are innocent Palestinians supposed to go? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=216.64s)]
*  He said you can go to the south. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=218.88s)]
*  You can go to the shore. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=220.64s)]
*  Is that at all realistic? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=222.0s)]
*  We just heard about your attempt to go to the border crossing in the south and that didn't work. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=223.84s)]
*  Is there anywhere for you to go to escape this barrage of missiles? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=228.16s)]
*  No, we tried everywhere. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=233.76s)]
*  They say go to the shore and then they bomb the shore next day. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=235.6s)]
*  They say go to the north and then they bomb the north areas next day. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=240.24s)]
*  Like everywhere. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=245.68s)]
*  They're bombing everywhere. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=246.4s)]
*  So no place is safe here in Gaza Strip. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=247.44s)]
*  It's just terrible and very, very, you know, very hard to explain because they're bombing everywhere. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  It's not just a place or like a place that is close to Hamas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  They're bombing places that are not related to Hamas too. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=267.68s)]
*  Like, I don't know, everywhere. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=272.48s)]
*  Haneen Okal, we have your number. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=276.48s)]
*  I know that the White House watches this show. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=279.2s)]
*  The White House can call me and we will put them in touch with you. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=281.6s)]
*  You and your kids need to get out safe and you need to get out safe as soon as is humanly possible. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=285.12s)]
*  Please stay safe. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=290.72s)]
*  Stay in touch with us. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=291.68s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=296.08s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=297.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqjqm7pBIIE&t=298.08s)]
