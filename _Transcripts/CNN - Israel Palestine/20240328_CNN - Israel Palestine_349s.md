# Ex-federal official explains why she resigned over US approach to Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0)
*  Another U.S. official has publicly quit their government job over the Biden administration's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=0.0s)]
*  handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Until yesterday, Dr. Anel Sheline was a foreign affairs officer at [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=4.8s)]
*  the State Department working in an office that promotes human rights in the Middle East. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Sheline details the reasoning behind her public resignation in a CNN opinion article, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=15.68s)]
*  and she joins us now. Thanks so much for joining. Thank you for having me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  You write regarding the forced displacement of Gaza civilians, the lack of aid, violence by Israeli [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=25.919999999999998s)]
*  settlers in the West Bank. You say, quote, these actions which experts on genocide have testified [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=32.88s)]
*  meet the crime of genocide are conducted with the diplomatic and military support of the U.S. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=38.4s)]
*  government. And that's the basis of your resignation. As you know, genocide is a very specific [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=44.08s)]
*  definition here. How do you feel Israel's behavior there meets that definition? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I would leave that to the experts. As you said, it is a very specific definition. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=55.6s)]
*  But I would argue that in general, the actions the Israeli military is taking are seeking to wipe out [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=60.4s)]
*  the population of Gaza. We've also heard such statements made by Israeli officials, political [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=67.28s)]
*  officials and military officials. Unfortunately, we're also hearing plans being made now for people [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  to take over the territory of the Gaza Strip. We had Jared Kushner come on and talk about how [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=81.12s)]
*  he's going to build high rises on this beautiful beachfront property. As you said, the crime of [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=85.68s)]
*  genocide does need to meet a particular legal definition. But I would posit that there are [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=93.12s)]
*  many experts who are arguing that this is what Israel is doing. Well, intent is key, of course, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=100.56s)]
*  because here, let's be clear, Hamas is a terrorist organization. It deliberately kills civilians, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=105.76s)]
*  as it did on October 7th, and it deliberately hides behind civilians in Gaza. I understand [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=110.88s)]
*  the argument that there has been insufficient attention to protect civilian lives there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=116.96s)]
*  But I wonder, who do you hold responsible for it? Is it Israel alone? Is it Israel and the U.S. for [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=122.32s)]
*  its support? But is Hamas? Does Hamas also bear responsibility for the civilian losses? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=129.28s)]
*  Absolutely. Hamas is a terrorist organization. I just think that the way Israel, and as well as [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=134.64s)]
*  the United States, have been involved in conducting this war, it could have been done in a very [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=140.16s)]
*  different manner. The levels of the casualties that we're seeing, the use of starvation as a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=144.24s)]
*  weapon of war, the fact that the United States isn't using its leverage to insist that aid get [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=149.04s)]
*  in and that a ceasefire be put in place. In particular, we're seeing from the Israeli public, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=154.48s)]
*  they are frustrated with the fact that their own hostages are not actually being prioritized. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=159.92s)]
*  Instead, we have the prime minister whose political future depends on this war going on for as long [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=164.32s)]
*  as possible. He's talked about going after Lebanon as well. I know that the U.S. government [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=169.12s)]
*  is trying to do everything they can to prevent that, but thus far, I shouldn't say everything [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  they can. They're not doing everything they can to prevent that. I would argue they need to use [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  all the leverage to make sure Israel neither expands the war and agrees to a ceasefire, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=183.12s)]
*  an exchange of hostages from both sides, and to bring in the necessary aid. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=189.68s)]
*  You told my colleague, Christiane Amenpour, today that you speak for a quote, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=194.88s)]
*  many people when standing against the U.S. government's Gaza policy. I wonder, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=198.56s)]
*  when you left, when you made your resignation public, when you wrote this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=202.48s)]
*  opinion piece for CNN, did many people, did many of your colleagues come to you and say, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=206.48s)]
*  we're backing you? They have. I was not planning initially to go public. I was only at the State [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=212.56s)]
*  Department a brief time, but when I started to tell people that I was planning to resign quietly, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=219.52s)]
*  they said, you know, please reconsider. Please, please go public if you'd be willing to. So I [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  decided I would, and since then, I have had people reach out to me. I think my greatest concern is [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  that by going public, I might somehow undermine some of these efforts, and the State Department [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  is doing very important work here, but I do think that public pressure is why we're starting to see [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=242.8s)]
*  the administration shifting here, and it is the administration that is making these decisions. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=248.0s)]
*  It's the president who is deciding what our policy towards Israel and regarding Gaza is going to be. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=252.32s)]
*  So even though there are many people inside state who disagree with this, it's going to take the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=258.32s)]
*  president changing his mind before we see a new policy. Let me ask you this, because as you say, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=263.04s)]
*  there has been both private and public pressure increasing from President Biden and the White [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=268.32s)]
*  House in recent days and weeks on Israel, for instance, not to go into Rafa in Gaza. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=272.96s)]
*  That's insufficient in your view. What would be sufficient in your view from the U.S. side? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  I think the U.S. needs to uphold our own laws. We have the Leahy laws that stipulate that U.S. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  foreign military assistance cannot go to units of a foreign military that are engaged in gross human [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=291.52s)]
*  rights violations. Also, a foreign government that is preventing U.S. humanitarian aid is no [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=296.96s)]
*  longer eligible for U.S. military assistance. We're not upholding those laws, so I think we [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=303.59999999999997s)]
*  could start there, just start upholding our own laws. I think this is particularly crucial not [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  only for the people of Gaza, but this administration has tried to distinguish itself from the previous [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=312.96s)]
*  administration as one that not only believes in the rule of law, but that believes in America's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=317.84s)]
*  role in the world and wanted to reestablish America as a leader, not only in terms of, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=323.68s)]
*  I know you've done work on great power competition, but if America is not going to [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=328.8s)]
*  distinguish itself from some of our adversaries that engage in these sorts of human rights [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=334.48s)]
*  violations, why should the rest of the world look to us as a leader? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=338.72s)]
*  You said it's a loss of soft power. Dr. Anel Shieland, thanks so much for sharing your point of view. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  Appreciate having you on. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv4Aciot4E0&t=347.84000000000003s)]
