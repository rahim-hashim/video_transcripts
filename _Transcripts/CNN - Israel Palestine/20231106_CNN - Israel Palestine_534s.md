# American nurse who got out of Gaza describes desperation she saw
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U)
*  This is a video of the aftermath of a strike in the Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=0.0s)]
*  According to a journalist working for CNN, the attack came during intense Israeli bombardment, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  a bombing Sunday night. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=9.92s)]
*  The IDF has not commented on the incident. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=11.28s)]
*  United Nations officials today said 70 percent of people in the Gaza Strip are displaced, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=13.8s)]
*  many in living conditions, a statement called, quote, inhumane. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=18.0s)]
*  The secretary general said the Gaza is becoming a, quote, graveyard for children. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=22.96s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the UN lashed out at those at the comments, called for the secretary [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=27.68s)]
*  general's resignation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=32.36s)]
*  Emily Callie Callahan is a nurse, activity manager for Doctors Without Borders, MSF. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=33.92s)]
*  She was evacuated last Wednesday and arrived back in the U.S. just over the weekend. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=40.42s)]
*  First of all, how does it feel to be out? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=46.84s)]
*  A lot of people keep asking me that, and I really don't have a good answer. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=50.08s)]
*  I obviously have a sense of relief that I'm home and I'm with my family and feel safe [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=55.56s)]
*  for the first time in 26 days. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=64.12s)]
*  And I'm having a really hard time finding any joy in any of it because me being safe [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  is the result of having to leave people behind. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=74.08s)]
*  People watching this have seen images from Gaza. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=76.92s)]
*  They've seen the hospital images. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  They've seen the horror of children dead day after day after day after day. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=81.84s)]
*  I mean, they've seen all the images. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=88.44s)]
*  But to actually be there and to experience it, you're experiencing all these things which [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  a camera can never capture. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=95.4s)]
*  So can you just talk a little bit about what, Stan, when you close your eyes at night, what [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=97.72s)]
*  is it you think about now? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=103.76s)]
*  I think the answer to that question, I think I'll start at KYTC, which was we were relocated [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=105.4s)]
*  about five times over the course of 26 days due to security concerns. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=113.76s)]
*  And one of the places we wound up was the Khan Yunis Training Center. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=117.56s)]
*  We call it KYTC. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=121.68s)]
*  That's when people had evacuated to the south. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=122.68s)]
*  So you were in the south of Gaza at that point. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  Yes, when we went to below Wadi Gaza Line. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=125.4s)]
*  And there were, by the time we left there, there were 35,000 people evacuated. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  There were 35,000 internally displaced people living alongside us. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=133.68s)]
*  There were children with just massive burns down their faces, down their necks, all over [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=139.24s)]
*  their limbs. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  And because the hospitals are so overwhelmed, they are being discharged immediately after. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  And they're being discharged to these camps with no access to running water. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=152.4s)]
*  There's 50,000 people at that camp now in four toilets. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  They're given two hours of water every 12 hours. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=160.0s)]
*  Four toilets for 50,000 people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=163.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=165.2s)]
*  And that's where we were living too. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=166.2s)]
*  And they have these fresh open burns and wounds and partial amputations that are just walking [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=168.2s)]
*  around these conditions. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=174.12s)]
*  And parents are bringing their children to us going, please, can you help? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=175.76s)]
*  Please, can you help? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=179.8s)]
*  And we have no supplies. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  When in situations where there are tens of thousands of people and it is a war and people [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=182.64s)]
*  can't feed their kids, things get strange very fast and things get tough very, very [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=189.76s)]
*  fast and people turn on each other. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=195.6s)]
*  You saw that up close. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=197.52s)]
*  At KYTC, we were, the reason we had to leave was because we were starting to be harassed. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  People, desperate people who are losing loved ones right and left are angry. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=206.24s)]
*  And they would point at me and scream American walking past. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=213.32s)]
*  And at that point, we had no idea what was coming in the next few days. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=217.52s)]
*  And they would yell things in Hebrew to see if we were Israeli. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=221.44s)]
*  They accused our national staff of either being traitors or said, you're you're pretending [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=226.64s)]
*  to be Arab. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=233.4s)]
*  We know that you're just pretending to be Arab. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=234.4s)]
*  Stop lying to us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=236.96s)]
*  And our staff had to defend themselves. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=237.96s)]
*  And we said to them over and over again, you don't have to stay. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=239.32s)]
*  We understand if you want to leave us. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=242.76s)]
*  And they said, you are family too. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=244.44s)]
*  And we're not going anywhere. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=245.8s)]
*  Your staff, the Palestinians who worked for MSF for Doctors Without Borders, were concerned [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=247.12s)]
*  about your safety. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=252.0s)]
*  We would have died within a week without them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=253.72s)]
*  They are the only reason we are alive. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=257.04s)]
*  It's incredible that this took so long to get Americans, sick people start to move through [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=259.44s)]
*  that rafa border crossing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=268.2s)]
*  It's inexplicable. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=270.0s)]
*  And we were desperate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=271.0s)]
*  We did a calorie count at one point based on our supplies and figured out that if all [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=272.72s)]
*  of us, there's 50 people with us living in a parking lot now, only eight, seven hundred [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=276.56s)]
*  calories a day. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=281.32s)]
*  If that's all we had, we had two days of food left and that's it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=282.32s)]
*  And our national staff took off. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  We had no cell service at that point. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=288.88s)]
*  So we had no idea what had happened to them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=290.24s)]
*  There's bombs going off all around us because there's no safe place in Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=292.68s)]
*  Even getting through that rafa border crossing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=299.52s)]
*  They didn't leave our side for a second. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=301.41999999999996s)]
*  You're the national staff. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  The national staff. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  They feared for your safety, even at the border crossing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  They made sure they were standing between us and desperate people. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=307.68s)]
*  They made sure that they were talking to every official that they could find, trying to push [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=310.48s)]
*  us through, trying to get us on the bus, trying to get us out. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=314.0s)]
*  And we're sitting there and we're watching these incredible men who have sacrificed everything [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  for us, who have sacrificed time with their families, their own physical safety, their [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=321.24s)]
*  own water supply they were giving to us. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  And we're watching them fight to get us across the border, knowing that we were not bringing [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  them with us. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  And they didn't waver. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=334.2s)]
*  Ibrahim was right in the front with our passports fighting so hard to get us on. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=336.2s)]
*  And we get to Arash that night and find out his parents are dead. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=341.40000000000003s)]
*  They were losing family members and friends. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=345.8s)]
*  You said if it wasn't for your national staff, you think you would have been killed by people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=350.68s)]
*  who were just desperate. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=356.52s)]
*  We either would have starved to death or run out of water. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=358.6s)]
*  They were the ones that negotiated all of that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=361.64s)]
*  Gaza is a small city, so everyone knows everyone. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=364.5s)]
*  And they would call in favors and call their friends and say, who do you know that has [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=367.02000000000004s)]
*  food? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=370.3s)]
*  Who do you know that's open? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=371.3s)]
*  Where can we get this? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=372.3s)]
*  And they would drive all over the place to find water. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=373.3s)]
*  And when we ran out of bottled water in Gaza, they were the ones that were able to figure [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=376.86s)]
*  out that the water truck was coming here at these times. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=381.70000000000005s)]
*  And oh, I know this guy has a grocery store and they still have power sometimes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=385.06s)]
*  I think I can probably get something from them. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=389.22s)]
*  When I say we would have starved to death without them, I'm not exaggerating. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=391.62s)]
*  And in the moments of absolute desperation of civilians, they were steadfast and calm [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=396.74s)]
*  and just talked to them and said, these people are also in the same boat that you are. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=403.14s)]
*  They have no supplies. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=407.58s)]
*  They also have no food and water. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=408.58s)]
*  They are also sleeping outside on the concrete and did it in such a beautiful way that they [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=410.18s)]
*  were able to talk them down with love and kindness. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=417.46s)]
*  There was no violence in their heart and it calmed everyone around them down as well. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=420.9s)]
*  Would you go back to Gaza? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=425.94s)]
*  In a heartbeat, in an absolute heartbeat. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=426.94s)]
*  My heart is in Gaza. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=430.78s)]
*  It will stay in Gaza. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=431.82s)]
*  The Palestinian people that I worked with, both our national staff in the office as well [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=433.46s)]
*  as my staff at Indonesia Hospital were some of the most incredible people I've ever met [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=438.14s)]
*  in my life. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=442.02s)]
*  When everything went off and we got the notice to move south of Wadi Gaza, I was texting [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=444.38s)]
*  my nurses at Indonesia Hospital and I said, we lost a nurse weekend one. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=450.90000000000003s)]
*  He was killed when the ambulance outside the hospital was blown up. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=457.86s)]
*  And I was texting them when we got the evacuation orders and I said, did any of you move south? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=462.34000000000003s)]
*  Did any of you get out? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=466.02000000000004s)]
*  Like, are any of you coming down this way? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  And the only answer I got was, this is our community. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=469.22s)]
*  This is our family. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=473.02000000000004s)]
*  These are our friends. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=474.02000000000004s)]
*  If they're going to kill us, we're going to die saving as many people as we can. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=476.02000000000004s)]
*  And I said, if I can ever have an ounce of the heart that you have, I will die a happy person. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=480.14s)]
*  They were incredible. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=487.94s)]
*  I would like to send out a reminder that there are civilians seeking shelter there and that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=489.46s)]
*  my doctors and nurses didn't leave out of loyalty to their community. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=493.65999999999997s)]
*  And I know that there is an idea being pushed right now that anyone that stayed behind is [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=498.5s)]
*  going to be considered some kind of a threat. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=503.21999999999997s)]
*  And I want to remind people that the people that stayed behind are heroes. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=506.3s)]
*  The people that stayed behind are, they know they're going to die and they're choosing [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=509.78s)]
*  to stay behind anyway. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=514.26s)]
*  You're talking about doctors, nurses in the hospital? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=515.26s)]
*  I wake up every morning and I send out a text message and I ask, are you alive? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=520.26s)]
*  And every night before I go to sleep, I send another message and says, are you alive? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=525.66s)]
*  Well, Kelly, thank you so much for your time. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7iWgCk14U&t=529.5799999999999s)]
