# Analyst: How Hamas is using cryptocurrency to raise funds
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8)
*  Investigators in the U.S. and around the world have identified a revenue source being exploited [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=0.0s)]
*  by Hamas, online donors offering support in cryptocurrency. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=4.7s)]
*  Now, even before Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, U.S. officials had been [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  probing the group's use of cryptocurrency through alleged money launderers. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=13.44s)]
*  Hamas' use of digital currency represents just one of the many ways the terrorist organization [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=17.64s)]
*  has sought to raise funds while evading sanctions. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=21.96s)]
*  Hamas and other terrorist groups have used Facebook and Axe to publicly post their crypto [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=24.92s)]
*  wallet addresses asking for donations, according to a report by U.S. authorities. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=29.88s)]
*  Joining me now is Dmitry Mashikin, CEO of the crypto analytics software firm BitOK. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=34.28s)]
*  Thanks so much for being here with us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=42.72s)]
*  So, first, how significant a role is crypto in terms of funding Hamas? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=44.12s)]
*  Well, from our site, we've analyzed and studied deeply the addresses belonging to companies [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  controlled by Hamas. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=58.76s)]
*  It's indicated in two orders, 1522 and 1923. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=60.0s)]
*  It's public. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=65.16s)]
*  So, the total amount of almost $41 million was received at these addresses. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=66.16s)]
*  And this is a total turnover of the addresses listed in two previous seizure orders. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=73.08s)]
*  And this was the significant amount received from September 2021 and April 2023. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=79.4s)]
*  So, that's a lot, but obviously it could be a lot more that we don't know about. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=88.72s)]
*  So, how exactly does it work? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=101.72s)]
*  How do they get the money? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=103.24s)]
*  I understand they fundraise on social media. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, how does that all work? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=107.08s)]
*  So, they gather different social medias and put in the different wallets addresses. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=110.27999999999999s)]
*  And then they're collecting money, I mean crypto, from all over the world. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=118.16s)]
*  And then they are using intermediary addresses from different kinds of exchanges around the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  world and then collecting them into several wallets and funds. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  This means they are laundering money using crypto. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=135.4s)]
*  Well, it happens, unfortunately. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  Is it untraceable in terms of the people who are donating this money? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  Almost. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=148.28s)]
*  So, in case if somebody say investing or donating a terrorist organization directly via centralized [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=148.96s)]
*  exchanges, it's possible. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=157.36s)]
*  But nobody is doing that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=159.24s)]
*  So, they are actually they are usually using decentralized wallets and non-custodial wallets. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=160.96s)]
*  And then those organizations are laundering money to avoid such disclosing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=167.4s)]
*  So, it's almost impossible. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=174.08s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, we're talking about people donating money on social media. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=175.8s)]
*  But in terms of these intermediaries and so on, I mean, what role does Iran play here? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  You mean centralized exchanges and so on and so forth. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=187.52s)]
*  So, we can determine the precise origin of the funds. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=189.36s)]
*  So, whether they were directly sent from other terrorist groups or sourced from donations, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  etc. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=198.12s)]
*  But however, our investigation revealed that a significant portion of these funds primarily [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  originated from cryptocurrency exchanges. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=203.72s)]
*  Some of them are really popular. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=206.52s)]
*  Some of them have Russian origin, but it's not connected with Russia itself because it's not [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  exchanges. They are not aiming to help terrorists. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  That's the most important thing here. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=218.8s)]
*  But in some of the cases, they are blind and they cannot understand what really happened [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=220.76s)]
*  and really. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=225.48s)]
*  And it sometimes weeks or months should be passed till exchanges are revealing such bad [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=226.6s)]
*  things happening. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  So, it's not online. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=236.12s)]
*  So, time should pass. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=238.04s)]
*  And now we may see that some of the exchanges fall under such bad circumstances in terms of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=239.56s)]
*  money laundering and terrorist financing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=245.16s)]
*  So, I mean, it sounds very hard to stop. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=247.68s)]
*  I mean, what more can be done to cut off this source of funding for Hamas? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=251.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's the question. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=257.68s)]
*  I mean, crypto is still in the gray zone. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=259.12s)]
*  But thankfully, international anti-money laundering measures are coming. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=262.24s)]
*  And because of legislation helping to reveal the source of funds, the dirty money and crypto, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=269.92s)]
*  it goes more and more better to reveal. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=276.88s)]
*  And from my perspective, the best way is to use KYCIML measures in any kind of politics, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=279.76s)]
*  exchanges, and to put exchanges' attention on that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=286.24s)]
*  And, you know, after all, crypto is not about crime, it's not about terrorist organizations, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=291.68s)]
*  financing, etc. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=297.2s)]
*  But anybody should be care of it because of where we are. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=298.64s)]
*  So, it happens and everybody should pay a lot of attention on it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=303.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's very complex for most of us to untangle, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  but really appreciate getting your insights on this. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=310.08s)]
*  Dmitriy Machikin, thank you so much. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfWjwKl-CA8&t=316.47999999999996s)]
