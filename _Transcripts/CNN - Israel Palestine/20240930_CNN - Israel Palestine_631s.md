# Israel begins “limited ground operation” into Lebanon, IDF says
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI)
*  The breaking news at this moment, Israel launching a ground operation in Lebanon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=0.0s)]
*  The military just announcing it's conducting raids against Hezbollah along Lebanon's southern [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=4.4s)]
*  border. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=8.32s)]
*  I want to go straight to Jeremy Diamond, who's in northern Israel along that border with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=9.32s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=12.84s)]
*  And Jeremy, obviously, you're there, you're in your vest. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  This is a major escalation that we're seeing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=18.48s)]
*  What do you understand is happening right now? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=20.2s)]
*  No question about it, Erin. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=25.1s)]
*  Over months now, we have wondered whether this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=26.18s)]
*  might escalate into an all out war, whether we might one day see Israeli troops crossing [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=30.1s)]
*  into the sovereign country of Lebanon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=34.74s)]
*  And indeed, tonight, that is what we are seeing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=37.9s)]
*  Israeli ground troops supported by artillery, which you just heard right as I was saying [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=40.18s)]
*  that in the background, being fired from here in northern Israel, a couple of miles away [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  from the border and heading straight for Lebanon, which is behind me, behind those hills there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  And indeed, tonight, the Israeli military is confirming that they are carrying out this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=55.14s)]
*  ground operation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=58.74s)]
*  They are characterizing it as, quote, limited, localized and targeted ground raids based [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=60.02s)]
*  on precise intelligence against Hezbollah targets along the border. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  I've been told that these operations are concentrated on Lebanese villages close to the border, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=69.18s)]
*  where the Israeli military has gathered intelligence and believes that there are indeed Hezbollah [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=75.82s)]
*  targets there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=81.12s)]
*  I've reported earlier today that the Israeli military had already begun carrying out special [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=82.16000000000001s)]
*  operations in recent days to gather intelligence in preparation for this ground offensive. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=87.04s)]
*  And tonight, what the Israeli military is confirming is that a force of its troops is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=92.68s)]
*  indeed crossing into Lebanon, supported by artillery fire, supported by the air force, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=97.72s)]
*  and is indeed carrying out this ground operation. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=102.64s)]
*  They want to characterize this, of course, as a limited ground operation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=105.04s)]
*  That was the understanding that Israeli officials reached with the White House, making clear [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=108.88s)]
*  that it would remain limited. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=112.92s)]
*  But of course, once you have troops going from one country into another country, there [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=114.64s)]
*  is no telling where this can go from here, Aaron. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=118.64s)]
*  And certainly with Israeli troops now going into Lebanon, going after Hezbollah on the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=121.69999999999999s)]
*  ground following the major escalations that we have watched over the course of the last [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=126.56s)]
*  two weeks with the enormous increase in Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon, in eastern [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=131.0s)]
*  the Lebanese capital of Beirut, the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, I think it's very clear [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=136.72s)]
*  right now that this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has indeed escalated into war. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=140.8s)]
*  Aaron. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=146.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=147.56s)]
*  So, Jeremy, let me just ask you, though, and I know we just heard that artillery as [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=148.56s)]
*  you were speaking. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  Have you sort of seen any explosions or heard anything else? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  Or, I mean, how are you able to sort of feel the difference where you are? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  And just a note to everybody, I mean, they're doing this obviously in the early hours of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=159.84s)]
*  it's almost two thirty in the morning along that Israeli Lebanon border. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=163.68s)]
*  Yeah, when we arrived here in northern Israel, just a couple of miles from the border [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  several hours ago, people here told us that this was the first night that they had heard [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=175.52s)]
*  a consistent and frequent artillery fire coming from this area going into Lebanon. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=180.28000000000003s)]
*  At the time, it wasn't clear to us whether that was preparations for a ground operation [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=185.52s)]
*  or the beginnings of that operation itself. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  But now that we've learned that this operation actually began a few hours ago, and in addition [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=192.44s)]
*  to the sound, we have actually been able to see some of the explosions happening over [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=197.32s)]
*  the hill right behind me, which is Lebanon. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  Indeed there, as you were hearing yet another artillery round going over, we have seen some [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=205.24s)]
*  of those explosions happening inside of Lebanon. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=209.88s)]
*  We also saw flares earlier today and we are hearing the word of a helicopter in the distance. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=212.82s)]
*  All of these, of course, signs of the multiple ways in which the Israeli military is carrying [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=218.0s)]
*  out this operation from the air, from the ground and with support, of course, from armored [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=222.6s)]
*  and artillery forces being held further back. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=227.88s)]
*  We have also seen, of course, an array of tanks and armored personnel vehicles along [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=230.8s)]
*  the side of a highway heading north towards the Lebanese border. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=235.24s)]
*  As that artillery fire continues in the distance, we don't we aren't able to see those explosions [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=239.96s)]
*  right now, but there is a bit of light behind that hill, which tells us that there are either [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  flares or explosions happening behind there, which is, of course, inside of Lebanon. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=249.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=254.44s)]
*  So let me, Jeremy, just to understand here, because obviously this is a crucial moment [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=255.44s)]
*  and they're trying to describe this as limited, that they're going to do something specific, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=258.88s)]
*  right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=263.72s)]
*  The opposite of some mass all of the tanks are parading over of that mass buildup that, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=265.0s)]
*  of course, we all saw so visibly along the Gaza border. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=269.32s)]
*  As you point out, this opens the door to the who knows factor once you start having soldiers [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=273.32s)]
*  in. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=278.2s)]
*  Is there any sense of, to the point you were making, who is going in, how many are going [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=279.2s)]
*  in, are they staying in, or is all of this really not known at this hour? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, we can glean a couple of things from this statement and from the information that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=290.36s)]
*  I've gathered from speaking to sources. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=296.32s)]
*  One of those things is that, first of all, those special operations had already been [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=298.4s)]
*  happening in the days before this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=301.8s)]
*  And when the Israeli military is coming out and saying a ground operation has begun in [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=303.44s)]
*  the last few hours, they are no longer just talking about special operations. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=307.4s)]
*  They're talking about something more significant. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=311.12s)]
*  Now, I was cautioned by some sources that this is not a very large force going into [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=313.32s)]
*  Lebanon, but they wouldn't say exactly how many forces there are. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=318.44s)]
*  And as I've said before, they are incentivized to continue to characterize this as limited, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  as targeted, as small. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=326.96s)]
*  And I would also note that when Israel began its ground operation in Gaza, which of course [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  we've now seen Israeli troops pour throughout the Gaza Strip, invading the entire Strip [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=334.48s)]
*  effectively, at the time they also characterized that as a limited ground operation that was [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=339.56s)]
*  slowly, slowly expanding. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=344.88s)]
*  And of course it ultimately expanded into an all-out invasion. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=346.24s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that's going to be the case here with Lebanon. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=349.48s)]
*  We don't know how deep this is going to go. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=353.18s)]
*  Some former generals who I've spoken to suggested that Israel should perhaps capture eight miles [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=356.06s)]
*  of territory into Lebanon to remove the threat of anti-tank guided missiles from the area [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=360.38s)]
*  of northern Israel, where some 60,000 residents have been evacuated. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=366.46s)]
*  It's not clear if Israel is going to go that deep yet, but again, we will see, I expect [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=370.38s)]
*  that we will see in the coming days, as this operation will likely expand, will go deeper [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=375.14s)]
*  into southern Lebanon. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=379.94s)]
*  The question of course is how deep and for how long will troops be there and whether [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=380.98s)]
*  or not they could get bogged down in a fight against Hezbollah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=384.8s)]
*  All right, of course, Lebanon, a sovereign country. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=387.76s)]
*  All right, thank you very much, Jeremy Diamond. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=390.24s)]
*  We're going to be going back to you, of course, as you get more information and depending [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=392.16s)]
*  on what you hear and see there. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=395.44s)]
*  As we heard that outgoing artillery fire from Israel into Lebanon behind Jeremy over these [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  past few moments, Fareed Zakaria joins me now, host of Fareed Zakaria GPS. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=402.52s)]
*  So Fareed, you hear Jeremy's reporting that there, this is obviously goes beyond the special [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=406.12s)]
*  operations forces which have been operating over that border, that this is bigger, but [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=411.04s)]
*  the Israelis are describing it as limited and not as an invasion. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=416.36s)]
*  What do you think is actually happening here? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=421.8s)]
*  I think what the Israelis are doing is implementing a strategy that they have long planned and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=426.68s)]
*  held in abeyance. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=432.32000000000005s)]
*  They have for a long time thought very seriously about what to do about the threat they face [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=433.76s)]
*  from Hezbollah, the constant rocket fire, the way in which Hezbollah has been able to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=439.44s)]
*  drive out maybe 100, 150,000 Israelis from their homes in northern Israel. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=444.56s)]
*  And the plan was to do something like this, which was to begin with that lightning communication [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=450.88s)]
*  strike, the cell phones and pagers exploding, then artillery and aerial bombardment that [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=457.2s)]
*  would essentially try to destroy a whole bunch of the weapons caches and target mid-level [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=463.76s)]
*  leadership and then go on and target the high-level leadership. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=469.32s)]
*  But to complete the job, they do have to go in to get out those weapons caches. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=473.24s)]
*  Hezbollah has its own network of tunnels, much like Hamas. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  They have to do all of that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=482.92s)]
*  So far Israel was always deterred from doing this because of the fear of Hezbollah retaliation, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  Iranian retaliation, the retaliation of a kind of the axis of resistance that Iran had [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=493.44s)]
*  always talked about. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=498.68s)]
*  But what they have done is they have pressed forward, taken the risk, and they have proved [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=500.36s)]
*  that that axis of resistance and Iran is more of a paper tiger. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=504.96s)]
*  So let me just ask you, you know, I mean, obviously, and what they did even on the pagers, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=510.36s)]
*  you know, we understand hacking into odometers of Hezbollah leaders' cars and possibly even [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=513.8s)]
*  into their smart TVs to hear their voices. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=519.68s)]
*  I mean, the level of intelligence involved is truly incredible to contemplate. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=521.72s)]
*  But yet, as Jeremy said, once you actually have soldiers and human beings going over [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=528.84s)]
*  the border, you get into a you don't know what's going to happen from there. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  How confident are they that they know what's going to happen from here, that this limited [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=538.48s)]
*  ground operation remains that way as opposed to something which appears very clear that [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=542.84s)]
*  they don't want and maybe couldn't even take on, which would be a full scale invasion or [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=547.7199999999999s)]
*  some kind of an occupation? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=552.3599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's very risky. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=555.52s)]
*  But look, they faced a problem, which was that Hezbollah raining rockets on them. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=556.7199999999999s)]
*  They were trying to figure out what to do. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=561.5999999999999s)]
*  And they took this calculated gamble that the Iranians were going to be at the end of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=563.28s)]
*  the day more cautious, that the Houthis were going to be more cautious, that Hezbollah [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=568.12s)]
*  would not be able to quickly retaliate. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=573.04s)]
*  And so far, that has proven right. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=576.24s)]
*  I think what you are seeing is that Israel is the superpower militarily of the Middle [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=578.56s)]
*  East today. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=585.28s)]
*  And it is able to strike at will in a way that it's very hard to retaliate. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=586.28s)]
*  You raise, Aaron, the crucial issue. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=590.64s)]
*  It's one thing to be able to get rid of bad guys. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=593.08s)]
*  It's another to figure out what to do with the space, the land. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=596.9399999999999s)]
*  It's what we discovered after Saddam Hussein, after Muammar Gaddafi, after the Taliban. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=601.34s)]
*  It's what Israel is discovering in Gaza after they got rid of the initial ground invasion. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=608.02s)]
*  So there you're right. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  And I would hope they understand that the best thing would be a quick mop-up operation [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=616.6800000000001s)]
*  and then withdraw back. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=622.98s)]
*  But it's always very hard because once you break it, you buy it, as Colin Powell famously [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=624.9200000000001s)]
*  said about Iraq. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCd_q-TOgzI&t=630.18s)]
