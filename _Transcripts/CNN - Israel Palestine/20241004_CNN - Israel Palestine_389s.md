# Analysis: Would Israel's Iron Dome be able to intercept a nuclear bomb?
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s)
*  So a couple of days ago we asked you for your questions about the complex situation here in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=0.0s)]
*  the Middle East and some of you have responded to us and we've taken some of those key topics [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=4.88s)]
*  and we're going to be answering them here in a few short videos. So what are the chances all this [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=10.48s)]
*  can end in peace for the Middle East? Well all conflicts do come to an end and I think the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=16.0s)]
*  question at the moment is how long will it take and because this conflict goes back generations, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=20.48s)]
*  many generations, it's going to take longer to solve. The deeper the history, the deeper the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=26.56s)]
*  problems, the more deep rooted it is, the more it's fixed in certain ways in people's minds and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=32.16s)]
*  positions are hardened. So I think the diplomatic process is going to take some time but there will [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=38.32s)]
*  be a solution that the military avenues will all be tried, people will get tired of them ultimately [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=44.4s)]
*  and they'll want peace and that's when it can really happen. So will Israel respond to Iran [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=50.32s)]
* 's attack and would that escalate the situation? The answer is almost assuredly Israel will respond [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=56.48s)]
*  because they believe in deterrence, they believe the way to keep themselves safe is through [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=62.8s)]
*  deterrence, they believe that they have to act for themselves out of their own interests, they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=67.75999999999999s)]
*  look at their own history and look at the Holocaust in World War II and feel that if they don't take [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=72.56s)]
*  the steps to protect themselves then their enemies will gang up on them, Iran being behind those [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=78.4s)]
*  enemies. So there will be a very clear deterrence message sent by Israel. The question is if Iran [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=84.48s)]
*  feels that these are affecting Iran's existential right to exist or its existence or its interests [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=91.28s)]
*  then there's going to be a response from Iran. So how Israel responds is absolutely connected to how [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=101.52000000000001s)]
*  and if Iran will respond. So the potential for escalation absolutely is there. So the question [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  is how is the UN involved here and what power do they have? Well they're absolutely involved [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=114.08s)]
*  behind the scenes diplomatically trying to bring parties to a table to get a ceasefire, they're [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=118.56s)]
*  involved with dealing with the outfall of conflict if you will, you know, displace people in Lebanon, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=123.84s)]
*  looking after people in Gaza, humanitarian supplies, shelter, all those sorts of things. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=130.0s)]
*  But when it comes to effectiveness diplomatically, look at the UNGA just last week, the UN General [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=135.04s)]
*  Assembly. So many of the world's top diplomats were there. There were talks about trying to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=139.92s)]
*  bring a ceasefire with Hezbollah and Israel but it was ineffective and part of the reason [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=144.32s)]
*  the UN is ineffective is not viewed by Israel as being objective, it is viewed as being partisan [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=149.44s)]
*  and if a mediator is partisan in this then they're going to find it hard to broker [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  a peace between two parties. What is the United States relationship with Israel and why are they [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  providing funding to them? The United States relationship with Israel goes back to the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=167.76s)]
*  founding of Israel because the United States believe coming out of World War II there needed [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  to be a safe place for the Jewish population but they have shared interests with Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  They view Israel as a democracy, as an important ally in the Middle East, as a country that provides [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  political heft in the region, diplomatic heft in the region, military heft in the region, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=190.0s)]
*  intelligence sharing in the region and the United States recognizes that it needs to support Israel [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=195.2s)]
*  financially to achieve that. Israel has over the decades become a country that is strong economically [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=200.95999999999998s)]
*  that's able to pursue its interests in the region but the United States shares those interests and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=208.64s)]
*  the best way to make that relationship strong and keep Israel strong the United States believes [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=214.88s)]
*  is to continue that funding coming in. I think the big takeaway has to be that this is deep-rooted [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=220.88s)]
*  and people have lived through this. It's complicated and they feel it passionately. This has been in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=227.6s)]
*  people's lives since they were born, it's been in their parents' lives since they were born. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  I've been coming to the region now for over 30 years. I've been back in Israel for most of the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=237.28s)]
*  past year since October 7th. This is passionate and it's passionate because it affects people's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=241.6s)]
*  lives and that's why the views are so strongly held and that's why people disagree so much about [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=248.4s)]
*  what happens here. So that's what I would say. The takeaway is when people disagree here it's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=254.24s)]
*  because these are such deeply held views. How effective is Israel's Iron Dome? It's very effective. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=260.64s)]
*  It hits many many of the incoming missiles that have been fired at Israel and I've got an anecdotal [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=268.0s)]
*  answer for that. I was in a house where there were many rounds of missiles being fired into [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=273.84s)]
*  the village where we were and they were being intercepted by the Iron Dome. We were relatively [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=280.0s)]
*  safe. The Iron Dome was removed and immediately those missiles were impacting right around where [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=285.11999999999995s)]
*  we were. You can see a massive change. It was much more dangerous without the Iron Dome. Iran attacked [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=292.23999999999995s)]
*  with ballistic missiles. They fly to a very high altitude, a very fast and come down with a massive [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=298.88s)]
*  payload. So Israel used not only Iron Dome, it used David's Sling which intercepts those higher [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=305.68s)]
*  altitude missiles and it used the Arrow defensive system which targets high altitude as well. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=311.52s)]
*  So it was relatively effective. We don't have a precise number but it absolutely, with the help of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=317.44s)]
*  the United States too, blunted the effect of Iran's strikes. Israel's Iron Dome can protect the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=323.36s)]
*  country on multiple fronts provided it has enough Iron Dome systems. They have limited areas of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=329.76s)]
*  operation. They link in together by computer. They automatically detect where the threat is coming [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  from but you need to have them located where those missiles, close to where those missiles, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=341.6s)]
*  are coming in or coming down and that means you need a lot of Iron Domes to protect all the country [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  all the time. So would Israel's Iron Dome be able to intercept or neutralize a nuclear bomb? The [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=353.6s)]
*  answer to that is no. Nuclear bombs can be dropped from an aircraft. They can come in on a ballistic [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=360.16s)]
*  type of missile but if you intercept a nuclear bomb over your country the way that the defensive [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=369.12s)]
*  systems work right now there's the potential that it detonates over the country and that would leave [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=374.88s)]
*  a radioactive effect and a massive electromagnetic pulse across the country if it were to detonate. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1dww_vAU9s&t=381.28s)]
