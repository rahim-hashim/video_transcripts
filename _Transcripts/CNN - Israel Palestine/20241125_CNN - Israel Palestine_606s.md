# Netanyahu approves Lebanon ceasefire deal ‘in principle,’ source says
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc)
*  A source says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved an [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=0.0s)]
*  emerging ceasefire deal with Hezbollah in principle. The source says [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=5.48s)]
*  details are still being negotiated and will need to be approved by the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=9.84s)]
*  Israeli cabinet, this as the death toll climbs in Lebanon. Lebanese [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=13.84s)]
*  officials say dozens were killed in Israeli strikes in Beirut and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=18.52s)]
*  beyond over the weekend. Lebanon's health ministry says Israeli strikes [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=22.44s)]
*  have killed more than 3,000 people since mid-September. The IDF says [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=27.16s)]
*  it struck 12 Hezbollah command centres in Beirut's southern suburbs [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=31.64s)]
*  on Sunday night. Meanwhile, Hezbollah fired some 250 projectiles from [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=35.8s)]
*  Lebanon on Sunday. Some were intercepted by Israel's air defences. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=40.8s)]
*  Sinéad Nik Robson joins us now from Jerusalem. I mean, it isn't a done [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=45.8s)]
*  deal, is it? But they appear to be making progress. They appear to be [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=50.36s)]
*  making progress, Max, and they appear, all caveats here, that this is [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=55.12s)]
*  perhaps the closest the Israeli government and Hezbollah through the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=59.72s)]
*  intermediaries, through the help of U.S. negotiation, have actually come [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=64.36s)]
*  to getting a ceasefire in place here. We have from the Prime Minister's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=68.32s)]
*  office here saying that in principle there's an agreement that follows a [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=74.56s)]
*  cabinet meeting last night where Netanyahu met with senior cabinet [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=78.48s)]
*  members and his top security officials, and also from another source in the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  region saying that they believe that the deal is getting close. Now, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=88.12s)]
*  there are issues, and the primary concern that we've understood from the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Israeli side all along is that if this 60-day ceasefire, which is the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=98.12s)]
*  principal part of the negotiations as we understand them, if that gets up [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=102.92s)]
*  and running, Israel wants the right to strike back if Hezbollah breaks the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  terms of the ceasefire. This appears to be one of the areas that they are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=112.44s)]
*  still not convinced that the language is right. They still have issues that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=117.72s)]
*  they want to see resolved or that aren't resolved fully clearly for them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  yet. So this is positive, and I think then when you look at those 250 [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=126.8s)]
*  incoming missiles from Hezbollah yesterday and over the weekend, more [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=131.28s)]
*  than 84 civilians killed inside of Lebanon and more than 200 injured just [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=134.84s)]
*  over the weekend, and the real uptick that we've seen in strikes in the heart [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=140.72s)]
*  of Beirut itself as well as those strikes targeting Hezbollah command and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=144.24s)]
*  control centres in the south of Beirut, an attempted, it appeared over the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=148.72s)]
*  weekend assassination attempt that didn't work on a senior Hezbollah commander [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=152.12s)]
*  by the IDF. All of that, it looks like you've got a massive uptempo in the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  war. This is not atypical when talks are coming to an apparent conclusion. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=160.8s)]
*  Look back at the war in 2006, there was an uptick in escalations in rocket [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=167.0s)]
*  fire and IDF strikes into Lebanon at the time. So it appears that we're in a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=172.72s)]
*  more positive position. More work to be done though yet, Max. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=178.04000000000002s)]
*  Is it as positive from the Hezbollah side? I mean, what are we hearing from [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  there? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=187.08s)]
*  You know, the last we heard directly from a senior Hezbollah figure was [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=188.88000000000002s)]
*  earlier in the week, and he said, look, we're going to keep fighting on the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  battlefield. We will also keep negotiating. Israel shouldn't think that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=194.56s)]
*  it can take things in negotiations that it can't take on the battlefield. So [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=198.6s)]
*  they're, you know, they're battle ready. But I think the principle [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=202.72s)]
*  understanding that's emerged from Hezbollah over the past couple of weeks [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=205.8s)]
*  is this statement that even prior to the war, they had indicated that they [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=209.36s)]
*  were ready to de-link their war on Israel's northern border with Hamas's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=215.4s)]
*  fight in Gaza against the IDF. That had been the principal guiding factor for [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=221.8s)]
*  Hezbollah to be in the fight, to keep staying in the fight. But when they [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  announced, indicated that, it shows that the war can continue in Gaza, and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  they can come to a separate ceasefire in the north. And that is an important [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=238.4s)]
*  position to be in. And look, there are political gains here for Prime Minister [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=243.52s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. If he gets to return those 60,000 people that were [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=246.72s)]
*  evacuated from the northern border, that's a big political plus for him at [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=249.88s)]
*  a time when he is taking some political heat, particularly, you know, on the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=253.08s)]
*  question of how did the war with Hamas begin last year? A lot of people in [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  the country want an investigation, and he's the one principally pushing [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=261.24s)]
*  back on that, Max. OK, Nick, in Jerusalem, thank you so much. Let's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=264.76s)]
*  take a closer look at a potential ceasefire. Jasmine Al-Gamal is a [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=268.32s)]
*  Middle East analyst, a former Middle East adviser to the Pentagon. She [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=272.44s)]
*  joins us now from London. Thank you so much for joining us. I mean, the [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=275.56s)]
*  headline sounds very strong, doesn't it? An agreement in principle. But [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=279.56s)]
*  it's all the detail that's been holding up agreements elsewhere, for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=285.72s)]
*  example. Absolutely, that's right. I mean, we've heard this for months [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=289.84s)]
*  with the ceasefire negotiations in Gaza. We know that US officials and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=296.28s)]
*  other officials had been telling us for months that a deal was close to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=300.96s)]
*  being signed when actually that was very far from the truth. So I take [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=304.48s)]
*  these these updates with a grain of salt. But however, there is reason to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  be cautiously optimistic when it comes to a deal being made in the next [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=314.56s)]
*  few days. There are a couple of things to watch out for in terms of the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=319.36s)]
*  diplomacy behind the scenes that's happening. The president's envoy to [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=323.32s)]
*  Lebanon, Amos Hoxdeen, who's been back and forth now for months trying to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=327.88s)]
*  get this deal, has basically said reportedly to the Israelis through the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=332.24s)]
*  Israeli ambassador in Washington that if Israel doesn't move close to a [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=337.84s)]
*  deal in the next few days, that he's going to walk away from these talks. We [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=343.44s)]
*  also know that the Pentagon's top Middle East official, Dan Shapiro, who [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=347.8s)]
*  was also a former US ambassador in Israel, is going to be in Israel talking [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=353.2s)]
*  to Israeli officials trying to get this deal through. And the argument that the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=358.48s)]
*  Americans are going to be making is the following. You have decimated Hezbollah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=362.8s)]
*  You have not destroyed it completely, but you have weakened it to a position [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=367.76000000000005s)]
*  that it really hasn't been before in recent history. And you now have still [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=372.8s)]
*  60,000 Israelis who are displaced from their homes in the north. You've sent an [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=378.44000000000005s)]
*  incredibly strong message to Iran time and again over the last few months. Now [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=383.44000000000005s)]
*  is the time to call it a win and take a deal. What do you think is the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  sticking point for Israel in this deal? When they say has to be ironed out, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=394.28s)]
*  what are the specific things they're most concerned about? Well, obviously, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=399.2s)]
*  the thing that they're concerned about is continued rocket fire from Hezbollah [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=404.03999999999996s)]
*  into Israeli cities and also rearmament, so smuggling of weapons into Hezbollah's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=408.76s)]
*  areas in the south of Lebanon, which has happened over the years. It happened [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=415.88s)]
*  after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. You saw Israel still [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  continue. Sorry, you saw Hezbollah after that war still continuing to receive [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=426.2s)]
*  weapons that were being smuggled from Iran via Syria into Lebanon. And that's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=430.67999999999995s)]
*  something that Israel doesn't want to see again. That said, again, like I said, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  the Israelis have basically weakened Hezbollah to a point where it is going [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=440.64s)]
*  to be much more difficult for them to continue to do the kinds of things that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=444.8s)]
*  they were doing before to rearm and strengthen themselves again. If anything, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=449.24s)]
*  the sticking points are actually on the Lebanese side because what this deal [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=453.72s)]
*  stipulates is that the Israelis have 60 days to start withdrawing back from the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=458.08000000000004s)]
*  Lebanese borders for Hezbollah to move its arms to the north of the Latani [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=464.6s)]
*  River and for the Lebanese army to start taking responsibility for overseeing [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  some of these stipulations in the deal, making sure that Hezbollah doesn't [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=475.68s)]
*  rearm. The Lebanese side is saying now that they want that 60-day window to be [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=480.88s)]
*  immediate. They want to see an immediate withdrawal by the Israelis as opposed to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=486.76s)]
*  a 60-day period. The other main sticking point is that the Israelis have asked for [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=491.6s)]
*  assurances from the Americans that they could still fire at Hezbollah positions [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=496.32s)]
*  if they felt that there was reason to, even after the ceasefire deal has been [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=502.2s)]
*  inked. And that's something that the Lebanese side is kind of balking over as [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=507.44s)]
*  well. Those are kind of similar to the sticking points that were there between [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=511.76s)]
*  Hamas and Israel when it came to signing that ceasefire deal in Gaza. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=516.72s)]
*  The fact that Israel wanted to remain able to strike after a ceasefire deal was [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=521.68s)]
*  signed if they thought it was necessary, with of course the other side saying [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=527.48s)]
*  absolutely not. A ceasefire deal is a ceasefire deal. It means you stop [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=531.96s)]
*  firing full stop. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=536.16s)]
*  Where's Iran in all this? We can't really talk about Hezbollah without talking [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=538.08s)]
*  about Iran. They'll be involved in all of this, won't they? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=541.48s)]
*  Absolutely. That's a great question. And of course, you would assume that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=545.6s)]
*  Hezbollah wouldn't be as far advanced in these talks and the Lebanese state in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=550.0400000000001s)]
*  general would not be advanced this far in the talks without Iranian approval. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  So suffice it to say the Iranians are OK with this deal being signed. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  But of course, as we know and as we've seen over months and years in the region, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  just because the deal is signed doesn't mean the sides are not going to continue to [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzytV8s7Xc&t=571.84s)]
