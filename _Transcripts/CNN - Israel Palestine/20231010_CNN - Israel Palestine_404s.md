# Israelâ€™s military amasses near Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs)
*  The Israeli military is mobilizing a record number of reservists, some 360,000, as observers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=0.0s)]
*  are anticipating a ground operation in Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=6.76s)]
*  The IDF is also amassing tanks and other military vehicles near the border with the Palestinian [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=10.0s)]
*  territory and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed retaliation on Hamas like never [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=15.48s)]
*  before. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=21.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, a ground operation could get complicated. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=22.0s)]
*  Gaza is very densely populated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=25.12s)]
*  It puts civilians in the middle of urban warfare where Hamas can utilize narrow city [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=28.28s)]
*  streets and a complex network of tunnels that can be used to move fighters, store weapons [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=33.2s)]
*  and launch a series of attacks. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  We want to discuss the situation now with a military expert who knows firsthand the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  hazards of urban combat. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=44.84s)]
*  We're joined now by General Wesley Clark. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=46.94s)]
*  He was the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO during the Kosovo War. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  General, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  We saw this drone video of Gaza earlier today. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=55.66s)]
*  This is the aftermath of aerial strikes on the territory. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=59.04s)]
*  I'm wondering what an Israeli ground operation in this region is going to look like. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=63.099999999999994s)]
*  Well, first of all, they've got to pick the targets. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=68.7s)]
*  And the way you would probably do this is to section off Gaza, maybe block by block, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=73.06s)]
*  figure out how to go in, isolate that area and work from the outside in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  You've got to work against the tunnel network and you've got to work against snipers and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=84.10000000000001s)]
*  other people on the high ground. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=88.14s)]
*  Now you've created a lot of rubble in the city right now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=89.94s)]
*  So you've got to stay away from those streets if you're trying to move armored vehicles [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  in there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=97.62s)]
*  So that adds to the obstacles there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=98.62s)]
*  It's going to be a very tough, slow, painstaking operation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=101.5s)]
*  Got to do it with maximum protection for your own troops because you have to understand [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=105.74000000000001s)]
*  this is not going to be a surprise to Hamas. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=111.27999999999999s)]
*  They knew that this is what they were going to get. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=114.32s)]
*  This is what they want. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=117.44s)]
*  They want to bring that Israeli ground force in and attack it from every direction and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=119.24s)]
*  put more casualties on it, show that it lacks credibility. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=124.88s)]
*  So Israel has to do this, has to do it well, has to maintain its military credibility. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=129.2s)]
*  It's an extremely difficult operation coming up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=133.72s)]
*  General, you described the targeting of tunnels and areas along that border. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=137.56s)]
*  There were civilians in Gaza that were trying or rather were told to evacuate a certain [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=143.56s)]
*  crossing and this Rafah crossing right here. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=151.56s)]
*  And it's been complicated partly because it was targeted. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=155.68s)]
*  Obviously you mentioned some of the complications regarding a ground operation. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=161.4s)]
*  What about the fact that Hamas is holding some 100 to 150 hostages, potentially some [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=164.6s)]
*  American citizens? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=169.16s)]
*  How does all of that, the difficulty of getting civilians out and the fact that there are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=170.6s)]
*  hostages in Gaza, alter the calculus for the Israeli Defense Forces? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  Well, obviously you'll have teams standing by that could do an emergency hostage rescue [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=178.84s)]
*  operation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=184.0s)]
*  If you could identify where the hostages are, if you could get entrance into that area with [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=185.24s)]
*  sufficient force to rescue them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=191.54s)]
*  Those capabilities will be there and we'll be monitoring all the electronic and visual [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=193.94s)]
*  intelligence we've got. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=198.58s)]
*  We'll be looking for other people talking and communicating, people on the ground. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=200.02s)]
*  We'll do everything we can to locate them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=205.62s)]
*  But you know, it's in Hamas' interest not to execute those hostages. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=207.7s)]
*  They need those hostages as bargaining leverage at the end. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=211.62s)]
*  So you're going to hear a lot of threats. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=215.7s)]
*  You may have some out of control people who do want to kill the hostages. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=217.62s)]
*  But my bet would be that the Hamas leadership will not want to give up those hostages. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=222.46s)]
*  For the sake of the families of those missing, General, I hope you're right about that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=229.74s)]
*  I do want to share with you some new satellite images we have of the Erez crossing complex. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=233.82s)]
*  So essentially what we're looking at this right here is Gaza and this is Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=239.9s)]
*  This is part of the border. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=247.02s)]
*  On it you can see craters in some areas where Israel launched retaliatory strikes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=248.78s)]
*  What really stands out to me are breaches in the border wall where Hamas broke through. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=254.14s)]
*  You can see them in these circles I'm drawing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=259.82s)]
*  This is where Hamas militants were able to get into Israel. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=263.26s)]
*  It's striking partly because of the scale, General, of the attack. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=267.9s)]
*  They executed an attack unprecedented in the history of Hamas. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=273.09999999999997s)]
*  Without Israeli intelligence having a clue that this was going to happen, how is that possible? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=276.94s)]
*  It's possible by just working with people you trust, keeping the circle of knowledge [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=284.86s)]
*  small and only talking face to face. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=290.94s)]
*  No electronic communications. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=293.82s)]
*  Nothing in writing that can go out. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=295.98s)]
*  If you do that, you can maintain security. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=297.98s)]
*  But you know, Hamas has been there for a long time. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=300.78s)]
*  We cannot underestimate their sophistication. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=304.06s)]
*  It's a mistake to think that they're just terrorists out there waving AK-47s. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=307.18s)]
*  This is a sophisticated military force. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=312.94s)]
*  It's had training. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=316.14s)]
*  It's had assistance from the Iranians. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=317.5s)]
*  Maybe some Russian equipment in there for all we know. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=319.66s)]
*  They can monitor communications. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=322.54s)]
*  They have cyber. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=324.54s)]
*  They have anti-aircraft missiles. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=325.82s)]
*  They have anti-tank missiles. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=328.06s)]
*  Got a lot of stuff buried underground. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=329.98s)]
*  They've prepared this for a long time. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=332.53999999999996s)]
*  We have to anticipate this is not like going when the United States Army raced through Baghdad [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=335.9s)]
*  in 2003. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=342.94s)]
*  Shattered the Iraqi guards. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=344.62s)]
*  And the people in Iraq were like, hey, some of us liked him. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=346.06s)]
*  Some of us didn't. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=349.58s)]
*  Let's see what happens now. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=350.78s)]
*  That's not what this is. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=352.7s)]
*  This is a fortress area that's been prepared. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=353.97999999999996s)]
*  Now, how many Hamas fighters are there? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=357.5s)]
*  15,000, 20,000. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=359.82s)]
*  We saw maybe 2,000 committed in this operation. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=361.82s)]
*  So they've got lots of forces left behind and ready and no doubt willing to sacrifice [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=365.18s)]
*  their lives to take Israelis with them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=372.86s)]
*  So this is going to be a tough fight. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=375.42s)]
*  And at the same time, of course, we've got the northern border to worry about. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=377.26s)]
*  The president's talking about maybe sending another carrier battle group in. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=381.02s)]
*  And don't forget, the North Koreans are now shipping artillery and ammunition by rail [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=384.94s)]
*  to the Russians to put the pressure on Ukraine. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=391.18s)]
*  We can never neglect that because that fight in Ukraine is very much in America's interest. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=394.54s)]
*  They're fighting our battle there against Russian aggression. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z8fvTfQgUs&t=400.14s)]
