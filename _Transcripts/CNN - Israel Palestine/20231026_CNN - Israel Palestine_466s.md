# New IDF video appears to show Hamas attempting to enter Israel by sea
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik)
*  And welcome back to a special edition of Outfront. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=0.0s)]
*  We are live in Tel Aviv, where tonight new attacks against Israel have happened. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=2.48s)]
*  It strikes Gaza in the water in this war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=6.88s)]
*  This is video from about 10 miles south of where we are. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=9.66s)]
*  This was an area actually hit by a rocket attack tonight here in Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=12.18s)]
*  Several people were injured. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=16.2s)]
*  And Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu sent Hamas this warning about what's to come. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=17.8s)]
*  When we go into Gaza, in the continuation of the fighting, we'll exact the full price from the murders. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=23.64s)]
*  Netanyahu not saying when a ground stage could begin. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=33.36s)]
*  President Biden today saying he told Netanyahu all efforts should be made to get Hamas to release all of their hostages first. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=41.08s)]
*  What I have indicated to him is that if that's possible to get these folks out safely, that's what they should do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=48.32s)]
*  It's their decision. But I did not demand it. If we get them out, we should get them out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=58.08s)]
*  Of course, there are about 220 of those hostages there. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=65.32s)]
*  Well, Israel says tonight that it has video that actually shows it boarding another Hamas attack by sea. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=69.08s)]
*  So our chief national security analyst, Jim Schuto, has this new video out front. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=74.84s)]
*  On Tuesday, a Hamas terrorist team attempting to enter Israel from Gaza by sea in IDF video, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=81.92s)]
*  which CNN cannot independently verify, Israeli naval forces seen intercepting the divers, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=89.16s)]
*  gunning them down on the beach and in the water. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=96.0s)]
*  It is not the first time Hamas has attempted to enter Israel by sea. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=99.52s)]
*  During the October 7th attacks, Hamas divers carried out another raid and made it inside Israeli territory [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=103.44000000000001s)]
*  before they were intercepted by the Israeli Navy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=110.92s)]
*  Hamas's seaborne attacks demonstrate the continuing depth and breadth of Hamas military capabilities, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=114.56s)]
*  even in the midst of devastating Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  Hamas has now attacked by sea, land and air. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=125.44s)]
*  On October 7th, aerial drones disabled surveillance equipment along the Gaza border [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=129.67999999999998s)]
*  and fighters air dropped into Israel in motorized paragliders. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=135.0s)]
*  Fighters breached border walls and sped into southern Israel on motorcycles and in armed SUVs. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=140.16s)]
*  Hamas dive teams form a formidable third front. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  This force is one that is a combination of a terrorist force, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=150.44s)]
*  as well as it has some attributes of a conventional military. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=154.56s)]
*  And what's particularly interesting about it is the fact that it, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=159.56s)]
*  they were able to integrate land, air and sea components into their efforts. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=164.48s)]
*  Hamas has honed these capabilities with intense training. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=171.84s)]
*  Hamas videos show training exercises on mockups of military bases, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=175.24s)]
*  much like those they stormed October 7th to deadly effect. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=179.76s)]
*  As Israel plans a possible ground offensive inside Gaza, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=184.36s)]
*  the concern among US military officials is that Hamas will again demonstrate [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  such military capabilities against Israeli forces in dangerous urban warfare. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  Gaza is a densely populated urban area, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=198.2s)]
*  and Hamas has constructed a complex network of tunnels rigged with explosives. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=201.32s)]
*  It's very clear that if Hamas can mount a coordinated combined force attack against Israel, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=205.83999999999997s)]
*  they can also mount a combined defensive operation. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=214.16s)]
*  And that combined defensive operation is going to be, I think, extremely significant. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=218.84s)]
*  And this is part of the message that US military officials are communicating to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=226.4s)]
*  Israeli military officials in advance of any Israeli ground offensive inside Gaza. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=231.16s)]
*  And it's notable, Aaron, that the Marine General US has dispatched here to Israel [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=238.0s)]
*  is a general who had experience in Fallujah in the 2000s. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=243.6s)]
*  It was a bloody campaign for US forces there, enormous losses on the US side. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=247.32s)]
*  It took weeks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=252.12s)]
*  And notably, the fighters inside Fallujah had weeks to prepare for that US assault, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=253.4s)]
*  still caused so much damage. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=259.08s)]
*  Of course, Hamas has had many years to prepare. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=260.8s)]
*  Aaron. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=263.56s)]
*  All right. Thank you very much, Jim. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=264.12s)]
*  And now with me, Shlomi Eldar. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=266.44s)]
*  He's reported extensively on Hamas. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=268.2s)]
*  He's the author of Getting to Know Hamas. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=269.88s)]
*  He's been in regular contact with Hamas leaders. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=271.6s)]
*  And on the day of the terror attacks, I know, Shlomi, you received, you shared with our [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=274.0s)]
*  viewers, one of the texts you received from Hamas senior commander, who said there would [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=277.04s)]
*  be no conversations about any of these hostages until Israel stopped attacking Gaza. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=280.92s)]
*  And this is even after you were crying with him on the phone as these horrific acts of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=286.16s)]
*  depravity were just becoming known, just some of the first ones. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=291.72s)]
*  All right. So I just want to start here with Jim's report. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=295.76s)]
*  So you've got this Hamas diver team even now, right, after there's been thousands of strikes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=299.12s)]
*  Many Hamas commanders, according to Israelis taken out, Hamas diver team even now infiltrates [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=305.2s)]
*  Israel by sea. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=310.76s)]
*  They say come up on a tunnel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=311.72s)]
*  Then we see the explosions sort of like whale spouts coming up from underwater. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=313.76s)]
*  What more do you know about Hamas's capabilities, naval and otherwise, right now, which clearly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=317.92s)]
*  still exist? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=322.8s)]
*  Yes, they exist. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=324.44s)]
*  And we have to say something about the tunnels. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  They invested billions of dollars of building tunnels since 2008, since the end of the caste [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=328.92s)]
*  lead. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  We have to talk now that there is an upstairs Gaza and downstairs Gaza. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  It started to build because they want to protect themselves to hiding for trying Israel assassinate them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=344.0s)]
*  So they invest many, many billions of dollars. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=350.04s)]
*  For example, all the money that Qatar providing them getting a suitcase from Qatar to Gaza, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=353.24s)]
*  instead of giving it to the population to relieve the situation, the economic situation [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  Gaza, they build tunnels and starting weapons. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=366.2s)]
*  This is the situation of Gaza. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=371.0s)]
*  And all the time you see the situation Gaza and what the difference between Hamas wanted [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=372.44s)]
*  to build tunnels, a project of tunnels for many, many years. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=378.24s)]
*  A massive investment, which now even now they're able to use them, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=382.72s)]
*  They're able to use them even now to try to infiltrate. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=385.68s)]
*  I tried to reach my sources in Gaza for many years. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=387.6s)]
*  So the last days I can't reach them, all of them underground. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  Because they're underground. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=395.16s)]
*  So no secrets. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=396.16s)]
*  So back to the landless. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=397.16s)]
*  Secrets and they can't reach them by phone. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=398.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  So to this point about these tunnels, two days since the last hostages were released [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  and then before that it was three days. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  What do you think is Hamas's next move with the hostages? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=408.12s)]
*  An Israeli source says that we are close to a deal. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=411.08s)]
*  But I must say that I'm following Hamas for many, many years. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=415.84s)]
*  I don't think that they release a large amount of hostages because they don't have any interest. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=419.76s)]
*  And for two reasons. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=426.4s)]
*  One reason they would like to show the Palestinian, the Gaza inhabitants that they achieved something. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  They will not release the hostages for nothing. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=434.84s)]
*  They need to release the Palestinian prisoners from the Israeli prison. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=437.56s)]
*  And one second point that they need the hostages for guarantee. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=442.68s)]
*  Otherwise Israel invade the ground invasion to Gaza. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=449.72s)]
*  And kills them all. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=453.16s)]
*  And kill them all. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=454.16s)]
*  So I doubt even Israeli sources that says that we are close to that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=455.16s)]
*  I'm not sure it will be come through. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, Shlomi, thank you very much. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  Shlomi Eldar, as I said. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPKox2abTik&t=465.40000000000003s)]
