# Video shows Palestinians fighting to get hold of ration packs
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA)
*  So amid a dwindling supply of humanitarian aid into Gaza, Jordan and France carried out [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=0.0s)]
*  the largest aid drop, air drop, by air over the besieged territory. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=5.08s)]
*  Virginia armed forces say they made four aerial aid drops on Monday in collaboration with [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=9.1s)]
*  the French, sending relief and food items, including ready-to-eat meals of high nutritional [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=13.72s)]
*  value. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=18.28s)]
*  One journalist tells CNN he saw four planes. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=19.46s)]
*  The first, the first air drop went into the sea, while the remaining three were dropped [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=21.32s)]
*  in southwestern areas of the territory. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=25.5s)]
*  Coming out with CNN's Jeremy Diamond reporting in from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=28.96s)]
*  Today Gaza's humanitarian crisis looks like this. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=33.24s)]
*  Palestinians desperate for food, paddling and swimming out to sea, after at least one [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=38.6s)]
*  plane air dropping aid appeared to miss its target, sending pallets of food crashing into [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=43.56s)]
*  the sea. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  In central and southern Gaza, hundreds crowding the beaches to try and secure their piece [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=52.0s)]
*  of the rations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  But this is the other side of desperation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=60.66s)]
*  Groups of men wielding whips and bats, steering crowds away from their precious cargo. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=64.14s)]
*  Months of hunger and war triggering fights for survival, when there is not enough for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=70.7s)]
*  everyone. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=76.38s)]
*  This is what they are fighting over, ration packs, a lifeline for the lucky few. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=80.28s)]
*  I was lucky and able to get one of these aids. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=87.06s)]
*  But what about all those other people who were not able to get this aid? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=89.22s)]
*  Look, this one didn't get any, and this one didn't get any. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=92.82000000000001s)]
*  But so much more is needed. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=96.54s)]
*  I'm asking from the Arab nations. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=99.34s)]
*  We are thankful for the aid for the parachutes, but we need more, and we need it distributed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=101.26s)]
*  in a better way. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  This will not stop our hunger. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=107.46000000000001s)]
*  We don't need a capsule. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=108.98s)]
*  Because when we eat this, we will eat it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=110.62s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=112.54s)]
*  It's finished. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=113.54s)]
*  But nowhere are people more desperate for food aid than in northern Gaza, where women [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=117.58s)]
*  and children wait in long lines for what now passes for food, a cloudy soup mixture made [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=122.26s)]
*  with dirty water and whatever grains can be found. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=128.34s)]
*  There is no food or drinking water, no flour or anything. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  There was no cooking oil, not even drinking water. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=137.94s)]
*  Death is better than this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=141.1s)]
*  Humanitarian aid deliveries this month dropped by half compared to January, according to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=144.06s)]
*  a United Nations relief agency, which blamed Israeli military operations and the collapse [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=149.18s)]
*  of civil order in Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=154.9s)]
*  In northern Gaza, aid groups suspending aid delivery amid looting and attacks on aid trucks, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=157.46s)]
*  leaving many with few options to stay alive. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=162.94s)]
*  Look, we are eating animal feed against our will, but have to eat it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=166.46s)]
*  Without food or clean water, their voices are all they have left. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=172.34s)]
*  The suffering of Gaza is extremely difficult. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=178.58s)]
*  Where are the authorities? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  Where is the government? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  Israel made us hungry and our government made us hungry and people are stealing. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  Shame on you Arabs. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=188.14000000000001s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=189.42000000000002s)]
*  But after nearly five months of war, is the world listening? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=190.86s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=195.86s)]
*  Yonati Surepto is the president and CEO of Save the Children. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=200.3s)]
*  She is with us this hour from New York. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=203.34s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time to speak with us. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=205.74s)]
*  It's appreciated. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  OK, so here's what life is like right now in Gaza. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  We'll hear first from a mother in Gaza City. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  Her name is Um El Amir Shamal. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  And then we'll hear from Jihad El-Dinja, who is in northern Gaza. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=216.06s)]
*  Here they are. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=219.46s)]
*  There is no food to feed my children, nor there is any bread. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=223.46s)]
*  We came to the point where we are eating tree leaves. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=227.22000000000003s)]
*  We are eating the food of this donkey. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=229.78s)]
*  All of northern Gaza is starving. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=231.9s)]
*  There is no shelter, no drink, no food. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=233.78s)]
*  There is nothing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=236.18s)]
*  It seems there'll be less than nothing, according to the UN. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=238.46s)]
*  Aid deliveries in February are half what they were last month, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=240.22s)]
*  which was a fraction of what is needed. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=242.78s)]
*  So Palestinians, especially in Gaza, are resilient people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=244.94s)]
*  Kids are used to hardship, but nothing like this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=247.98s)]
*  And the fear is that now it could get a lot worse. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=250.86s)]
*  So that is really offensive on Rafa goes ahead. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=252.78s)]
*  Describe what worse looks like. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=255.06s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, John. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's almost inconceivable. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  Last month, I didn't think worse was actually possible, but clearly it is. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=262.3s)]
*  You've got to remember there's now 1.4 million people in Rafa, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=268.34s)]
*  which was a smallish city housing 300,000 people before. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=272.62s)]
*  Now there's three times as many. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=279.06s)]
*  There are essentially tents and people everywhere. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=281.38s)]
*  On every single street, road, there are people sheltering. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=285.09999999999997s)]
*  Under a piece of tarp, in a tent perhaps, or in a makeshift shelter. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  And this is essentially the last line, Rafa. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=296.98s)]
*  There is nowhere to go. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=302.5s)]
*  People can't leave. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=303.94s)]
*  People can't go back to the north. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=304.94s)]
*  They're still fighting there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=306.94s)]
*  They're probably not allowed to cross the Wadi Gaza in the middle. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=308.42s)]
*  And as we heard, there is no food, not of anything, anywhere in the north. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  Anyway, aside from a lot of unexploded ordinances. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=318.94s)]
*  So it is really quite... [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=322.42s)]
*  It bears no thinking what would happen if there would be an incursion now into Rafa, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=326.42s)]
*  where people are completely stuck, essentially locked up, with nowhere to go. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=331.82s)]
*  And because people are so close together, it is inconceivable that you would go in there [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  with a lot of bombs and shelling and violence. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=343.26s)]
*  Because children will absolutely bear the brunt of that violence. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=347.82s)]
*  It is such a difficult situation to even think of the words to how to describe what is possible there, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=355.26s)]
*  because so much has already happened. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=359.5s)]
*  So, yeah, it is unthinkable. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=361.14s)]
*  This is from an opinion piece, for CNN rather, by UNICEF CEO Catherine Russell. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=363.94s)]
*  At least 90% of Gaza's children under the age of five are affected by one or more infectious diseases. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=368.62s)]
*  And that 70% have had diarrhea in the past two weeks. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=373.62s)]
*  At least 17,000 children in Gaza are now unaccompanied or have become separated from their families. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=376.46s)]
*  In other words, they are now orphans, their parents are dead. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=381.82s)]
*  Now, this is the view from above Kanyunas, which is a little bit north of Rafa. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=385.18s)]
*  And as you can see, as this shot slowly moves in, as it gets closer and closer and closer, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=388.78s)]
*  if you look at that, you see people are just going about their daily lives. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=392.65999999999997s)]
*  They're living life. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=396.82s)]
*  And this is what life is now like for more than a million and a half Palestinians. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=397.74s)]
*  This is reality. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=401.85999999999996s)]
*  They're cramped into these tent cities everywhere and they are living in close quarters. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=402.78s)]
*  It's perfect for the spread of disease, to say the least. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=407.09999999999997s)]
*  In many ways, are you surprised that the disease has not spread faster and worse than it already has? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  To some extent, yes. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=416.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's also fair to say that it's hard to really get a full picture of all the numbers, the diseases. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=418.53999999999996s)]
*  You know, there is no opportunity to test people necessarily for a lot of things. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=425.73999999999995s)]
*  But yes, also don't forget, it's very hard to get clean water in Gaza. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=431.54s)]
*  It was hard to get clean water. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=436.38s)]
*  The water situation before the conflict wasn't great. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=438.02000000000004s)]
*  Since October 7th, it's been completely dismal. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=440.82s)]
*  Water plants, desalination plants are not working. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=445.74s)]
*  Water comes in literally in rips and dreds, in bottled water in the trucks if they come in, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  which is, and there's not enough of that happening either. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=455.18s)]
*  So no clean water. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=457.70000000000005s)]
*  I think, what is it, one shower for every thousand people or so. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=459.70000000000005s)]
*  So people, there's no way to do proper hygiene. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=463.22s)]
*  So yeah, it is not surprising that many, many children present with diarrhea and that infectious diseases will spread. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=467.42s)]
*  So in terms of manmade disaster, which this is, it could end tomorrow. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=475.66s)]
*  Either Hamas could stop using the population in Gaza as human shields, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=479.3s)]
*  or the Israeli government could decide to stop killing children. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=482.58000000000004s)]
*  Is there anything comparable to what's happening in Gaza right now? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=485.66s)]
*  And the outsize impact it's having on children. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=488.98s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwTfedTjXOA&t=493.26s)]
