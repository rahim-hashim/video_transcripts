# CNN experts explain how ceasefire deal came together and what happens next
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU)
*  Well, I'm Becky Anderson in Doha where I've been reporting on this ceasefire and hostage [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=0.0s)]
*  deal brokered by the Qataris alongside the Egyptians and the U.S. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  And I'm Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv where the Israeli government is actually still finalizing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=11.28s)]
*  its approval for this actual agreement to go through and be implemented. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=15.48s)]
*  What we want to do is give you a bit of background as to how we got here and what might happen [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=19.72s)]
*  next. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=26.92s)]
*  What's been going on in the past couple of weeks? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=27.92s)]
*  Well, that is when we started to hear rumbles that a deal might be imminent. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=31.32s)]
*  Well, you'd be forgiven for getting a sense of deja vu, of course, because we have been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=38.36s)]
*  here before. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=43.96s)]
*  But like I say, about two weeks ago, we did begin to get a sense that something might [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=44.96s)]
*  be on the table. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=50.52s)]
*  Why do you think that was, Jeremy? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=51.52s)]
*  Yeah, Becky, I think it's very clear that, you know, the board kind of changed. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  There was a lot happening in this region that really changed the equation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=57.82s)]
*  Israeli and American officials, of course, repeatedly pointed to the fact that this ceasefire [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=62.06s)]
*  agreement between Israel and Hezbollah was brokered in late November, that that further [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=66.34s)]
*  isolated Hamas. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=71.18s)]
*  There was also the discussion about the killing of Yaya Sinwar back in October. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=72.8s)]
*  And then, of course, there is the elephant in the room, which is the election of President [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=78.88s)]
*  Trump. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=83.02s)]
*  And it's true that since November, we really did feel a shift in the momentum in terms [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=85.02s)]
*  of these negotiations. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=88.06s)]
*  But it was only in the last two weeks, as you point out, that we actually got a sense [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=89.34s)]
*  of how real this momentum actually was. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=93.78s)]
*  And there's one man, I think, that we should name in all of this, in moving the needle, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  as it were, and that is Steve Wittkopf, who is the incoming president's envoy to the Middle [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  East. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=109.62s)]
*  He is neither a diplomat nor is he involved in foreign policy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=110.62s)]
*  He is a guy that Donald Trump has decided can get stuff done. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=115.06s)]
*  And that is what he sent Wittkopf in to do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=119.98s)]
*  As I understand it, in late November, he started getting involved in these discussions, in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=123.0s)]
*  these mediation efforts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=130.3s)]
*  It has to be said alongside the Biden administration. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=131.58s)]
*  And Becky, he was in the room yesterday for that press conference in Doha, Qatar, where [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=136.78s)]
*  you were, and you were sitting there waiting as this press conference was delayed, delayed, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=140.98s)]
*  delayed as they were putting the final touches on this deal. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=145.78s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=148.78s)]
*  Yeah, that was really interesting. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=149.78s)]
*  So around about six o'clock in the evening on Wednesday the 15th, and we've been waiting [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=150.98s)]
*  for sort of 24, 36 hours to get a call that an announcement was imminent. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=156.5s)]
*  We got it around six in the evening. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=163.46s)]
*  We went over to the Diwan where the prime minister has an office here in Doha. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=165.62s)]
*  And then we waited and we waited and we waited, which is not unfamiliar. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=172.06s)]
*  And we all get that in the press. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=177.06s)]
*  But it was a good three and a half hours before the prime minister walked into the room and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=178.78s)]
*  said, we have a deal, a deal that we hope to implement on January the 19th. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=184.9s)]
*  And if that happens, Jeremy, then the big question is what happens next? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=191.86s)]
*  What are you hearing? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=196.70000000000002s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=197.9s)]
*  There is tremendous uncertainty as we are speaking about this at this very moment. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=198.9s)]
*  It's important to look at what else is happening here in Israel and what else is happening [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=203.28s)]
*  not just in the background, but really in the foreground of Israeli politics right now [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=207.24s)]
*  is that the Israeli finance minister, Betzalel Smotrich, he is making a pretty significant [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=211.46s)]
*  stand here, opposing this agreement and demanding assurances from the Israeli prime minister [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  that Israel will go back to war once the first phase of this agreement is implemented. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=226.7s)]
*  And it's not clear how the Israeli prime minister is going to handle that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=233.61999999999998s)]
*  It's very difficult to imagine him backtracking at this point. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=240.89999999999998s)]
*  Just imagine the reaction that he would face from the incoming U.S. President Donald Trump [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  who was hailing this agreement and hailing his own role in getting this agreement across the line. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=249.82s)]
*  Yeah, and that's really interesting, isn't it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=255.1s)]
*  Because there's a bit of back and forth here between Donald Trump and Joe Biden as to who [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=256.9s)]
*  actually is responsible for this deal. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=261.3s)]
*  And it has to be said that this deal looks remarkably like, if not exactly the same, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=264.34s)]
*  as a deal that was proposed by Joe Biden back in May. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=273.26s)]
*  Yeah, Becky, and it really is hard not to think about how similar this deal is. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=277.7s)]
*  That framework that he made very clear this week is indeed the basis for this agreement. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=282.1s)]
*  And not only in looking at the text of this latest deal and looking back at what was leaked [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=287.54s)]
*  in the Israeli press, for example, in May and in July about that framework that was agreed to [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=294.58s)]
*  at that time, but beyond that, there is also even evidence here in Israeli society that rather than [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=300.18s)]
*  Hamas being the obstacle, that it was the Israeli prime minister as well. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=306.74s)]
*  And not only is that evidence through reporting here in Israel, our reporting as well, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=311.22s)]
*  including, for example, in late July when the prime minister made a series of new demands that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=316.26s)]
*  appear to have scuttled negotiations at the time. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=321.62s)]
*  But Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right member of this Israeli government, made very clear just this week [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=324.18s)]
*  that he was part of scuttling this deal over the summer. He said, quote, over the past year, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=331.22s)]
*  through our political power, we successfully prevented this deal from moving forward time [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=336.18s)]
*  and time again. And so if you just listen to the man himself, who we know has enormous power, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=341.94s)]
*  and you look at what we were just talking about, about what's happening right now with Betelel [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=348.58s)]
*  Smotrich and the Israeli prime minister, there's no question that politics played a role here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=353.06s)]
*  And that's also where the U.S. president seems to have come in with enormous pressure. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=358.74s)]
*  And what does that mean for the people of Gaza? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=364.34s)]
*  When we saw that this deal was announced, I mean, these images that we have from Gaza [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=366.34s)]
*  just show you the extent of the agony that people have been undergoing for 15 months, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=371.94s)]
*  the extent to which this was such a pressure release valve. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=377.7s)]
*  Seeing children smile that widely is not something that we have seen over the course of the last 15 [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=381.29999999999995s)]
*  months. And, of course, here in Israel as well, we saw this kind of wave of relief that really [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=387.53999999999996s)]
*  crashed over so many people, the families of the hostages in particular. But there is still some [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=393.62s)]
*  mixed emotion, Becky, and a lot of that has to do with the uncertainty that lies ahead. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=399.7s)]
*  Which hostages are alive? What condition will they come out in after over 15 months? And so [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=404.66s)]
*  this roller coaster that we have seen for 15 months now certainly is not over yet. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=410.9s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of uncertainty still that lies ahead. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfdMB3M-BpU&t=415.54s)]
