# ‘We feel alone’: Schumer addresses antisemitism
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc)
*  In the weeks since the October 7 attacks in Israel, killing thousands, over a thousand [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=0.0s)]
*  Israelis, including women, children, and doing so with some barbaric ways, we have seen an [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=7.0s)]
*  alarming rise of antisemitism around the world, particularly here in the U.S. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=16.0s)]
*  Jew hate. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=21.0s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest ranking Jewish elected official in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=22.0s)]
*  the U.S. just addressed this crisis in a powerful speech on the Senate floor. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=26.0s)]
*  I have noticed a significant disparity between how Jewish people regard the rise of antisemitism [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=31.0s)]
*  and how many of my non-Jewish friends regard it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=41.0s)]
*  To us, the Jewish people, the rise of antisemitism is a crisis, a five alarm fire that must be [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=45.0s)]
*  extinguished. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=55.0s)]
*  For so many other people of goodwill, it is merely a problem, a matter of concern. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=56.0s)]
*  After October 7, Jewish Americans are feeling singled out, targeted, and isolated. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=63.0s)]
*  In many ways, we feel alone. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=72.0s)]
*  CNN's Melanie Zinona joins me now from Capitol Hill. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=76.0s)]
*  Melanie, it is so interesting to hear somebody like Chuck Schumer say what he just said and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=81.0s)]
*  really take up the mantle to speak for Jews in America in a way that we don't always hear [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=87.0s)]
*  Jewish leaders, even and especially Chuck Schumer, do. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=94.0s)]
*  That was a really powerful moment on the Senate floor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=98.0s)]
*  For Chuck Schumer, it is personal. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=102.0s)]
*  He is the highest ranking Jewish lawmaker in the country. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=104.0s)]
*  That is why he said he felt compelled to speak out and to draw attention to what he views as a crisis [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=108.0s)]
*  in the country. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=114.0s)]
*  But what he really wanted to convey here were the fears and anxieties that Jewish Americans feel in [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=115.0s)]
*  the country right now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=121.0s)]
*  He ticked off a number of incidents since that October 7 attack. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=122.0s)]
*  He also described what it felt like to hear some of his fellow citizens say that the war and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=125.0s)]
*  that Hamas was justified in some way, a message that could have been directed at some members of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=131.0s)]
*  his own party. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=135.0s)]
*  Now, of course, this speech comes as Congress has been wrestling with trying to do an aid package [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=136.0s)]
*  for both Israel and Ukraine. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=141.0s)]
*  As of right now, though, that package really hinges on whether they can find bipartisan agreement [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=143.0s)]
*  on a border security provision package. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=148.0s)]
*  That is something that Republicans have been demanding be included in any aid package that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=151.0s)]
*  includes money for Ukraine. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=155.0s)]
*  But that is a complex issue, Dana. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=157.0s)]
*  As you know, it's something that has long eluded Washington for many years, so we'll see if they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=159.0s)]
*  can get it done. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=163.0s)]
*  As of right now, they are trying to make some progress, hoping to get a handshake deal by the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=164.0s)]
*  end of this week on that part of the package. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=167.0s)]
*  Could see something on the floor next week. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=169.0s)]
*  But it's a high task over here in Congress to get something like that done. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=171.0s)]
*  So all eyes, we'll see whether they can get it done, Dana. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=175.0s)]
*  High task to get anything done in Congress these days, probably fair to say, even and especially [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=178.0s)]
*  things that historically have had a lot of bipartisan support. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=184.0s)]
*  Thank you, Melanie. Appreciate it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UKGQ3ORCkc&t=187.0s)]
