# Israel strikes Beirut, vows ‘very strong’ response to Iran
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo)
*  Israeli missiles striking near the heart of Beirut in the latest attack since the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=0.0s)]
*  Multiple explosions heard as an Israeli airstrike hit the center of the capital. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=7.04s)]
*  The death toll from that strike now at nine, according to Lebanon's health ministry. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=11.6s)]
*  A resident Telsin in a Hezbollah-affiliated health authority office was hit. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=15.92s)]
*  Right now Israel is weighing its next move, of course, against Iran in retaliation for Tuesday's ballistic missile attack by Tehran. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=20.56s)]
*  Israel's ambassador to the UN vowing a strong, painful response soon, even as President Biden is urging restraint. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=28.24s)]
*  Do you think the support of attack on Iran's meteorite site by Israel? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=38.56s)]
*  The answer is no. They have a right to respond, but they should respond and force you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=44.0s)]
*  We have CNN coverage across the region. CNN's Nick Robertson is in Tel Aviv, Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=51.04s)]
*  Jomana Cardice joins us from Beirut. Jomana, to you first. What do we know about this latest explosion? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  It was massive, it was powerful and in the heart of Beirut. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  Well, you know, Sarah, it was a long and terrifying night for the people of Beirut. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=68.4s)]
*  Last night we were here on the roof and we could see those airstrikes and the strikes continuing all night. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=72.72s)]
*  It started about midnight with airstrikes hitting the southern suburbs of Beirut. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=78.4s)]
*  Behind me you could still see some of the smoke rising behind over my shoulder there. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=84.56s)]
*  This is where we have seen the Israeli strikes focused in recent weeks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=90.72s)]
*  The southern suburbs that is really Hezbollah's seat of power and the idea of saying it is going after Hezbollah targets there. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=96.0s)]
*  But then what we saw later on in the evening was this big strike in the heart of Beirut. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=104.0s)]
*  And it came with no warning, Sarah. We did not hear from the IDF the usual warnings for civilians to leave the area. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  It was targeting, it appears, a Hezbollah-affiliated health authority in the heart of Beirut. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=119.68s)]
*  At least nine people were killed, seven of them medics according to that health authority. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=127.84s)]
*  But this happening in the middle of the city, in the middle of the night, something that people here haven't seen since the 2006 war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=133.44s)]
*  And even then that was rare, has really added to that sense of anxiety and apprehension and fear here. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=140.24s)]
*  We were out on the streets of Beirut speaking to people near the American University of Beirut. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  This is considered a safe area and people say they no longer feel safe. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=153.12s)]
*  They feel that these strikes are getting closer and closer. Sarah? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=157.84s)]
*  Yeah, the residents have been through so much there in Beirut long before this started happening. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=162.72000000000003s)]
*  And now this rattling them in ways we cannot imagine. Thank you, Jemana. Let's go to Nick now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=167.92s)]
*  Nick, Israel's cabinet is still deciding how to respond to Tuesday's missile attack by Iran. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  What is it that they are considering at this point? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, a strong painful response is, as you quoted there, from Israel's ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  And he said what we've heard from the prime minister and the defense minister, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=193.44s)]
*  that Israel has the ability to reach targets wherever it wants to in the Middle East. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=197.2s)]
*  And those targets could range from a maximum, if you will, Iran's nuclear facilities where it processes and enriches uranium. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=202.72s)]
*  Israel has long said that this is part of Iran's plan to make a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=212.96s)]
*  Iran denies it, but those sites are ones that Israel has wanted to hit for a long time and has held back [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=218.08s)]
*  because the United States has worked a diplomatic channel on that and Iran is clearly under pressure not to target them now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=224.72s)]
*  The economic interests of Iran, like the oil exports, that might be a more readily and easily manageable target [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=233.36s)]
*  because some of those oil facilities are sort of on the border with Iran, right on the sea and the Gulf, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=241.2s)]
*  and are therefore relatively safe for targets to hit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=246.4s)]
*  The extent isn't clear, but Israel wants to maintain its deterrence, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  which means sending a signal that Iran can understand that Iran should cease and desist, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=254.4s)]
*  not only targeting Israel directly, but supporting its proxies both in the south, in Gaza and in the north in Lebanon, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=259.36s)]
*  and the Yemenis, of course, who fired drones at Tel Aviv last night that were intercepted. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=266.96s)]
*  So it's going to be a strong message, precisely the targets. No hints, no hints at the moment of the past couple of days. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=273.52s)]
*  Nick Robertson, thank you to you and to Jomana Karadzhe there in Beirut. Appreciate it, John. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=282.0s)]
*  All right, with us now Joel Rumed, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs in the Obama administration. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=287.76s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=292.64s)]
*  You just heard Aaron reporting from northern Israel that folks there think they are poised for victory over Hezbollah. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=294.56s)]
*  How weakened do you think Hezbollah is right now? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=300.72s)]
*  Yeah, John, it's great to be with you and I think Aaron is spot on. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=305.44000000000005s)]
*  These are heady days in Israel and the Israelis do feel like what has taken place over the last several weeks [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  where they executed the pager attacks and followed that on with the killing of Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=314.8s)]
*  And now there are reports that at least half of the arsenal that Hezbollah had of rockets that they have pointed at Israel [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=320.72s)]
*  has been decimated. I think the Israelis feel like this is the moment to strike. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=328.08s)]
*  And that's why the real question now is are they going to work to finish the job in Hezbollah? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  How aggressive will they be versus how much momentum will they have to then move towards Iran in a response? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=339.76s)]
*  And I do think that for Israelis getting the north repopulated is a very high priority to show [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=346.96s)]
*  that terrorist groups cannot shrink Israel's borders, Israel's territory by these attacks. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=354.0s)]
*  And I think that's where we're probably going to head in the near days. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=360.32s)]
*  So part of the answer to the question of how weak is Hezbollah now is depends on the response to this next question, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  which how weak do you think Iran, how weakened do you think Iran is right now? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=368.48s)]
*  Well, look, getting to this question of weakness, you know, Hezbollah is weaker now than it has been in decades. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=374.64s)]
*  That does not mean it's eliminated. And so the challenge here is that Hezbollah has been backed by Iran [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=381.04s)]
*  for decades, supported by Iran. And the Iranian response just over the last couple of days in many ways [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=387.92s)]
*  was trying to show that it still does support Hezbollah while Hezbollah gets decimated on the battlefield. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=394.56s)]
*  So this calibration of an Israeli response towards Iran also will have an eye on Hezbollah [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  on trying to deter any resupply, any restocking of Hezbollah, not allowing Iran to continue to try to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=406.08s)]
*  build up Hezbollah as it has been built up over the last decades. And so I think for Israel [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=414.0s)]
*  strategically, they're going to have to really make targeting choices that provide that kind of strong [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=420.08s)]
*  security that they can get from battlefield activity on the ground Hezbollah to not allow Hezbollah [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=426.56s)]
*  to return to the form that it's been over the last decades. And look, the calculations, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=433.92s)]
*  my impression is the calculations have completely changed over the last three weeks. And you know, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=438.88s)]
*  you always throw one terms like, oh, fears of a wider war. But what is a wider war at this point? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=444.16s)]
*  If Hezbollah, if their power is smashed, if Hamas, if their power is smashed, if Iran is somewhat weakened, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=450.0s)]
*  what does Israel have to fear from Iran? Strikes more powerful than the ones they attempted the other day? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=457.68s)]
*  Yeah, John, you're spot on. Look, all the taboos have been broken. These questions that were [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  sort of lingering for the past years about the danger of a regional war. Well, we've now seen [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=471.6s)]
*  Iran strike Israel twice. We've seen multiple organizations backed by Iran striking Israel [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=477.6s)]
*  repetitively since Hamas launched and started this war on October 7th. Hezbollah joined in, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  the Houthis joined in, now Iran has joined in, and Israel is still standing. And so from the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=490.48s)]
*  Israeli perspective, they're saying this is the moment to strike. And you know, these taboos, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  now they're broken. And we see what's happening and we can take it. And I think that's, of course, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=500.0s)]
*  very risky and very dangerous because one always gets concerned about an overreaction that could [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  potentially destabilize the region significantly further. But that said, the taboos have been broken. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=512.32s)]
*  Israelis see what the response is like and they see that they can move on Hezbollah and that they [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=518.72s)]
*  should do that to protect their north because their north has been living under the gun, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=524.88s)]
*  as Aaron pointed out, depopulating northern Israel in a manner that Israelis just cannot sustain any [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=529.12s)]
*  longer and they do not want it. And that's why they're very supportive of these attacks on [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=535.36s)]
*  Hezbollah. Look, it might be risky, as you say, but it is important to understand the shift in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=539.6s)]
*  mentality that has occurred over the last few weeks. Joel Rubin, thank you so much for being [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  with us. Appreciate it. Thanks, John. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml0ctbomENo&t=548.08s)]
