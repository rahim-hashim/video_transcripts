# Israeli special forces have carried out ground raids in Lebanon
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA)
*  CNN has learned of cross border commando raids by Israel into Lebanon, into the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=0.0s)]
*  southern part of the country. These raids back and forth could be a sign [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=7.5s)]
*  that a larger ground invasion could be coming. Obviously there have been [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=12.64s)]
*  airstrikes on Beirut for days now. Let's get right to CNN chief national [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=16.5s)]
*  security analyst and anchor Jim Schuto, who is in Tel Aviv. Jim, these raids, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=20.62s)]
*  what do they show and what do they tell us? Yeah, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=26.2s)]
*  well, John, you could call these shaping operations smaller special forces [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=30.12s)]
*  raids as well as just the barrage of airstrikes that we've seen over the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=37.12s)]
*  last several days, not just taking out Hezbollah leadership, but going after [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=42.56s)]
*  firing positions, missile launch sites, missile and rocket storage sites in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  southern Lebanon would all be part of laying the groundwork for a broader [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  incursion or small scale invasion, whatever language you use. So one can say [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  that those operations have already begun. And keep in mind what the Israeli [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=63.48s)]
*  goal here is, as stated publicly, we're not guessing about this. Israel's goal, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=67.48s)]
*  as officials have described, is to move Hezbollah back from the border. And to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=72.6s)]
*  do that, they seem to be making it clear they don't just intend to do damage to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=78.1s)]
*  Hezbollah forces along the border, but push them back. The typical dividing line [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=85.08s)]
*  is the Latani River about 10 miles back from the border so that when you have [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=89.8s)]
*  the Israeli defense minister go speak to Israeli forces now massing on the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=93.64s)]
*  northern border and use this phrase, we will employ all the capabilities at our [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=99.48s)]
*  disposal. That's quite clear public signaling about what may very well be [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=103.92s)]
*  the next step. And I think you could see these these special operations raids [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=110.02s)]
*  as well as the bombing and the strikes we've seen in recent days as part of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=114.48s)]
*  that same ground operation. Jim, what is now known about Hezbollah as it is [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=120.16s)]
*  currently constituted? Their will and ability to carry out retaliation. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=125.92s)]
*  You know what, John, I think to some degree in recent days and weeks, if you [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=133.72s)]
*  go back, for instance, to the pager attack, as well as the killing on Friday [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=137.88s)]
*  of Nasrallah, we've seen something of a piercing of the bubble of Hezbollah's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=142.04s)]
*  military capabilities. As advertised, this was Iran's strongest proxy weapon [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=147.2s)]
*  in the Middle East and against Israel, its strongest piece of that ring of fire [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=153.44s)]
*  around Israel. We talked to great length about the many tens of thousands of [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  missiles and rockets, etc. But now in just a few days time, Israel has not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  only dismantled its leadership right up to the very top, but it's taking out [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=167.16s)]
*  a lot of those very missiles, which raises questions as to whether even if [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=171.52s)]
*  a decision were made by Hezbollah to carry out a sizable retaliation, who [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=176.44s)]
*  would make that decision and how would they communicate that to field commanders [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=181.08s)]
*  to then carry it out? It's not clear that they have the capability to do that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=185.28s)]
*  I don't mean to underestimate Hezbollah's remaining arsenal or the threat, but [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=188.84s)]
*  the blow that Israel has struck in recent days really raises questions as [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=194.0s)]
*  to what they're capable of. And we should also keep in mind Iran's public [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=198.4s)]
*  comments, which has been to say, we're kind of leaving this to Hezbollah to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=202.4s)]
*  retaliate. We're effectively sitting this one out, not to minimize Iran's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=206.72s)]
*  own capabilities, but at least from the public messaging standpoint, they seem [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=211.84s)]
*  to be keeping their powder dry as well. It is something that absolutely bears [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=216.16s)]
*  watching is Hezbollah on its heels as much as it seems, at least from [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=220.24s)]
*  everything we see and hear. Jim Chudo, it's great to have you there as our [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=224.32s)]
*  eyes and ears. Thank you so much, Sarah. All right. This morning, the U. S. Is [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  preparing its military as fears grow that Iran may be planning retaliatory [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=231.4s)]
*  attacks. CNN's are let science at the White House with more on how the Biden [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=236.12s)]
*  administration is sort of viewing all of this at the moment on their meeting at [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=239.2s)]
*  this very moment. What are you learning? Or let [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=243.76s)]
*  well, Sarah President Biden is hoping to prevent this situation from escalating [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=247.32s)]
*  into a wider regional conflict that could engulf the region. That is [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  something that the administration has feared and really tried to work to [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  prevent for the past year. Now, a U. S. Official tells CNN that one major area [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  of concern right now is the possibility that Iran could be planning an attack [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=267.96s)]
*  in the wake of Israel's killing of Hamas leader Hassan Nasrallah just last [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=273.32s)]
*  Friday. So the U. S. Is working with Israel on its defenses. This U. S. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=278.4s)]
*  Official said, hoping that a joint defense and a change in the U. S. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=283.44s)]
*  Military posture in the region could potentially ward off a potential attack. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=288.52s)]
*  Now, this official did not outline what an Iranian attack would look like or [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=293.6s)]
*  specify the exact moves that the U. S. Could take. But the Pentagon, in a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=298.12s)]
*  statement on Sunday, did stress that if Iran tries to or any of its partners or [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=302.36s)]
*  proxies tries to use this moment to target either American personnel or [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=307.5s)]
*  American interests, that the U. S. Would respond to defend the American people. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  The Pentagon is noted that they have significant capabilities in the region, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=317.46s)]
*  including a carrier strike group, and they are also working to increase the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=321.18s)]
*  readiness of U. S. Troops who could mobilize to the region. Now, President [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=325.82s)]
*  Biden on Saturday convened a meeting of his national security team, along with [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=329.94s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris, to assess the situation in the Middle East and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=334.26000000000005s)]
*  also talk about the readiness of U. S. Military forces. And just yesterday he [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=338.58000000000004s)]
*  stressed to reporters that he believes an all out war must be avoided. Take a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=343.26000000000005s)]
*  listen. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=347.94000000000005s)]
*  All out war in the Middle East be avoided. It has to be. We really have to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=350.34000000000003s)]
*  avoid it. We've already taken precautions relative to our embassies [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=355.74s)]
*  and personnel who want to leave. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=360.66s)]
*  But [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=363.14s)]
*  we're not there yet, but we're working like hell with the French and many [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=364.74s)]
*  others. Thank you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=367.5s)]
*  That last line there is a reference to the U. S. Hope that there could be some [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=371.44s)]
*  type of diplomatic solution to try to return Israeli and Lebanese civilians [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=375.04s)]
*  back to their homes. President Biden also said he does plan to speak with [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=379.46000000000004s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu soon, though officials have [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=383.18s)]
*  not detailed how soon that conversation might happen. But Biden making very [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=386.34000000000003s)]
*  clear there that he wants to take whatever steps possible to try to ensure [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=390.44s)]
*  that this war does not spill out into a wider regional conflict that would [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=394.32s)]
*  engulf the whole region. Our let's signs. Thank you so much for reporting [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=399.0s)]
*  there from the White House. Kate with us now to talk much more about all of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=402.66s)]
*  this is a former I. D. F. Spokesperson, retired Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=406.34s)]
*  Conricas. Thank you so much for coming in. It's good to see you. So this new [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=409.52s)]
*  reporting that is that is really special forces have been carrying out [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=413.28s)]
*  targeted raids into southern Lebanon, gathering intelligence ahead of a [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=418.28000000000003s)]
*  possible ground incursion. From your experience, if this is happening, do you [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=422.36s)]
*  think a ground incursion is inevitable? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=427.92s)]
*  Well, nothing is inevitable. First of all, good morning to you and thanks for [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=433.08s)]
*  having me. Nothing is inevitable if at this stage, um, ceasefire agreements or [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  talks would be successful and the French and the Americans would get his [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=444.52s)]
*  ballad to agree to implement security council resolution 1701 and move beyond [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=450.0s)]
*  the Litani River, then no such ground operations would be necessary. Israeli [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=456.08s)]
*  civilians would be able to move back to their homes. And I think Israel would be [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=460.91999999999996s)]
*  very happy to avail itself to other threats that it has against its national [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=465.2s)]
*  security, unfinished business in Gaza and elsewhere. So no, this is definitely [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=469.8s)]
*  something that can be avoided. But as the trajectory is now, it looks as if [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=474.90000000000003s)]
*  nobody's really making it something that can be avoidable. And Israel, as a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=479.68s)]
*  sovereign country, has a responsibility towards its people to allow them to go [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=485.16s)]
*  home safely. And I think the operations and what you refer to the information is [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=489.44s)]
*  part of making that happen and taking the necessary preparations in order to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=494.22s)]
*  bring their civilians home. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbG-voFXaOA&t=498.72s)]
