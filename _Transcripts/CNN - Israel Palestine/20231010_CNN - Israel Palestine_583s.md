# Israel Defense Force general recounts what he saw after Hamas attack
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE)
*  And I want to begin our coverage live here tonight with Nick Robertson. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=0.0s)]
*  He is out front live in Stadrath, Israel, which is about 45 miles south of where I'm [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=4.08s)]
*  standing right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=9.24s)]
*  And, Nick, where you are, many loud explosions just moments ago. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=10.24s)]
*  What's happening, as best as you can tell? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=14.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of helicopter activity in the sky. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=17.52s)]
*  I heard fighter jets. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=22.16s)]
*  This is not that uncommon, but we've heard a lot of mechanical heavy equipment moving [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=23.54s)]
*  in the area between this town and the Gaza fence, which is less than a couple of miles, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=28.8s)]
*  really, from where we're standing right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=34.92s)]
*  So there's a lot of machinery, mechanized units being, military units being maneuvered [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  in that area at the moment. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=43.88s)]
*  We don't know what for, but the explosions that we've been experiencing here over the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=45.28s)]
*  past perhaps hour or so, but pretty intense up here in the past 20 minutes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=49.92s)]
*  If you see a big flash go off behind me, counter three, counter four, counter five, and then [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=58.279999999999994s)]
*  you will hear a huge explosion. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  The explosions have been enough to shake the roof of this building here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=65.96s)]
*  So they're impacting in Gaza a couple of miles away, and it's enough to shake the roof of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=70.2s)]
*  the building here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=75.56s)]
*  But what we found when we went to Kaffa Azza, which it took, by the way, it took the Israeli [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=76.56s)]
*  Defense Forces 48 hours of fighting against Hamas to take back control of it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=82.76s)]
*  What we found there and what the Israeli Defense Forces wanted to show us was what they were [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=90.96s)]
*  describing as the brutality of the way that people were treated there, of the residents [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=96.24s)]
*  were treated, that some of them had their hands bound, that whole families were executed, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=101.84s)]
*  parents, children, people even beheaded, he said. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=108.0s)]
*  This is what happened on the road there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=111.88s)]
*  The drive into Kaffa Azza is chilling. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=117.08s)]
*  Evidence of Hamas's butchery everywhere. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=121.76s)]
*  This Israel Defense Force general shocked at what he found. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=125.72s)]
*  I thought about General Eisenhower that come to the death camp in Europe and the first [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=130.2s)]
*  thing that he said is bring the press, young children. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=137.2s)]
*  He did the same, inviting about 50 journalists. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=142.92s)]
*  You will see. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=147.2s)]
*  It's a big massacre, a big disaster. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=148.2s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like this in your career before? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=151.83999999999997s)]
*  Never, never. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  Less than a mile from Gaza, 70 Hamas fighters stormed in here early Saturday, some even [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=155.68s)]
*  flying. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=163.16s)]
*  They're telling us this is one of the paragliders that flew in here. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=164.16s)]
*  You can see the engine here, the propellers here made of carbon fiber, the fuel tank up [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  here and the frame of it and the seat at the front. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  The IDF in control now after a two-day battle. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=178.28s)]
*  Hamas lie where they fell. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  Only now the extremes of their barbarity becoming apparent. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=186.84s)]
*  700 plus civilians lived here. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  How many were killed still unclear. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=197.16s)]
*  How they died, brutally apparent. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=200.2s)]
*  Some decapitated, they say. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=204.56s)]
*  Kill babies in the front of their parents and then kill the parents. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=207.88s)]
*  They killed parents and we found babies between the dogs and the family that killed before [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=211.92s)]
*  him, they cut head of the people. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=219.28s)]
*  Each body bag, silent sentinel to the intelligence failure that allowed Kafr Azza and other communities [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=222.88s)]
*  near Gaza to be overrun and motivation for troops too. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=230.6s)]
*  We wait to switch ourselves from the defense to the attack because we defend our people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=236.76s)]
*  and until now we collect their body. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=244.44s)]
*  And when you say you're going to attack, will you be going into Gaza? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=246.92s)]
*  So we can see it here. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  I look to the next 100 yards. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=252.84s)]
*  Do you take care of the next 100 yards? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=255.92s)]
*  Next 100 yards and I fight to the next 100 yards and then look forward. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=258.36s)]
*  To a possible showdown with Hamas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=263.8s)]
*  How and when still to be determined. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=266.88s)]
*  And that's really where I think these troops find themselves at the moment. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=271.88s)]
*  They're waiting for that political decision. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=277.6s)]
*  The sense with them today was that there was a sort of a pause, but not a pause where you [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=280.24s)]
*  sit back and rest, but a pause where you change posture and begin to lean forward. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=285.16s)]
*  You get that sense for them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=290.44s)]
*  They're really waiting to get the political direction of what they need to do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=291.56s)]
*  They know that if they go into Gaza that this will be a very bloody fight, a very dangerous [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=295.36s)]
*  fight for them because they'll be fighting in streets, in small streets, in civilian [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=300.04s)]
*  neighborhoods where they're the enemy, where Hamas, Islamic Jihad know the terrain, where [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  the population is against them, but also in an environment where their rules of engagement [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=311.48s)]
*  are to avoid civilian casualties. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=316.44s)]
*  Yet in an environment like that in Gaza, civilian casualties, as we've seen in the past, do [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=318.64s)]
*  and will happen. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=325.2s)]
*  So all of this stands in front of Israel, stands in front of the prime minister right [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=326.2s)]
*  now, and most particularly stands in front of those troops we were with today. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=330.84s)]
*  Erin? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=335.32s)]
*  All right, Nick, thank you very much. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  And Major Ben Wallhouse is a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, for the IDF. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=340.32s)]
*  And I very much appreciate your time, Major, on the back of this reporting. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=344.8s)]
*  And here we are tonight. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=348.32s)]
*  Hamas obviously has always been a brutal organization. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  Now though, these reports we're seeing beheadings, ISIS-like cruelty, babies. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=354.76s)]
*  Have you seen a shift in their tactics? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=360.68s)]
*  Well, Hamas has always been a murderous terrorist organization and has openly stated its explicit [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=365.2s)]
*  aim to kill all the Jews and all the Israelis that it can. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=371.16s)]
*  So in terms of who it is as an organization, that's nothing new. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  But surely the extent and the barbaric nature of these attacks is something that we haven't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=379.32000000000005s)]
*  seen before. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  And as your journalists saw today, as our forces go through the South and clear house [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=385.38000000000005s)]
*  by house, making sure there is no terrorist presence left, we're starting to hear those [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=389.8s)]
*  stories. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=394.24s)]
*  We're starting to find those corpses that were brutally mutilated, entire communities [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=395.24s)]
*  massacred. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=400.06s)]
*  And yes, as you say, this is something that we haven't seen before. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=401.06s)]
*  Major, there's the strikes coming from Gaza. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=405.06s)]
*  I also understand there was a clash between IDF soldiers and Hamas militants inside Israel. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=409.5s)]
*  In the north meantime, three rockets were seen launched from Syrian territory, according [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=416.6s)]
*  to the IDF just tonight. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=421.18s)]
*  Rockets were launched from Lebanon earlier. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=423.38s)]
*  Where does security of Israeli land stand at this hour? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=426.68s)]
*  Yes, this is an extremely complex security situation. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=431.72s)]
*  We are continuing intensive fighting in the South with the aim of stopping Hamas' attacks [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=435.96s)]
*  and making sure they can't carry these kinds of attacks out again. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  Thousands of rockets are still being fired into Israeli cities indiscriminately. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=445.04s)]
*  And at the same time, as you say, on our northern border and on our eastern border, we have [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=449.08s)]
*  anti-tank fire, rocket fire from Lebanon and Syria. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=455.16s)]
*  We have called up over 300,000 reserve soldiers who have left their families and are deployed [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=458.56s)]
*  on all of their borders. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  And in the north, we're watching very carefully and making sure that the message is clear, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  that no one should join in the fight. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=469.52000000000004s)]
*  Reuters is reporting, Major, that for months leading up to the attack, Hamas misled Israel [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=475.20000000000005s)]
*  to believe that it didn't want to fight, didn't want a confrontation. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=479.92s)]
*  And the report from Reuters cites a source close to Hamas saying that the organization [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=483.5s)]
*  actually even went so far as to construct a mock Israeli town, a settlement in Gaza, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=487.5s)]
*  where they practiced a military landing. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=493.26s)]
*  They did all these things. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=494.86s)]
*  They trained to storm it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=495.86s)]
*  Can you confirm any of this? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=498.12s)]
*  Well, Hamas' intentions have always been clear. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=501.14s)]
*  The fact that it makes a mock Israeli town to invade shows that Hamas' war is a war against [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=504.58s)]
*  civilians. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=509.74s)]
*  Hundreds of terrorists streaming across the border and massacring women and children and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=510.74s)]
*  elderly is a war against civilians. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=515.26s)]
*  Taking civilians, entire families into Gaza, abducting them, that's a war against civilians. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=518.54s)]
*  And at the same time, they're using their own civilians as human shields, placing their [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=524.14s)]
*  military targets inside homes, mosques, hospitals, all in an effort to use their civilian population [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=528.1800000000001s)]
*  as shields. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=534.82s)]
*  So in terms of any sort of a mock settlement that they may have created, do you now know [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=539.22s)]
*  where that is or what they were doing? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=543.74s)]
*  Do you now have the intelligence to sort of look at how this actually was trained for [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=546.14s)]
*  and accomplished? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=549.9s)]
*  Well, we're looking forward at the moment. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYxGjMCTFdE&t=550.9s)]
