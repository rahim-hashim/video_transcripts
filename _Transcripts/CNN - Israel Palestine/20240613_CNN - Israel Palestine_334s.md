# Samantha Power describes 'devastating' humanitarian situation in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg)
*  More news now from the G7 summit in Italy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden tapping down expectations [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=2.96s)]
*  for an imminent ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=5.64s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=8.28s)]
*  I've laid out an approach that has been endorsed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=10.08s)]
*  by the UN Security Council, by the G7, by the Israelis. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=13.32s)]
*  And the biggest hangup so far is Hamas refusing to sign on [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=18.0s)]
*  even though they have submitted something similar. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=24.76s)]
*  Whether it had not come to fruition remains to be seen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=28.0s)]
*  We're gonna continue to push. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=31.36s)]
*  I don't have a final answer for you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=32.52s)]
*  And right now I'm joined by the USAID Administrator, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=35.4s)]
*  Samantha Power. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=38.64s)]
*  Administrator, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  How much is every day without a ceasefire [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=41.96s)]
*  actually worsening the already horrific [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=45.0s)]
*  humanitarian crisis in Gaza? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=47.84s)]
*  It's absolutely devastating, Wolf. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=52.6s)]
*  This could not be more urgent. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=54.68s)]
*  You have about 95% of the Gaza population [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=57.6s)]
*  has not had access to clean water in months. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=60.44s)]
*  This last week, despite all our best efforts, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=63.56s)]
*  only 95 trucks on average got into Gaza each day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=66.12s)]
*  That's in part because of the fighting, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=70.64s)]
*  IDF military operations, Hamas fighting, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=72.24s)]
*  Hamas hiding of course among the civilian population. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=74.56s)]
*  But it's also, it's so difficult for aid workers [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  to move around inside Gaza. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=80.84s)]
*  With a ceasefire, you would have multiple crossing points [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=83.64s)]
*  open, a full flow of assistance going in, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=87.46000000000001s)]
*  and that mobility on the ground that would allow [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=90.4s)]
*  the displaced population, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=93.16s)]
*  because almost the entire population has been displaced [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=94.58s)]
*  since October 7th, to be able to get access to food, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=96.88s)]
*  to shelter, so many of them are living out in the open air [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=100.2s)]
*  rather than in tents, and of course to vital medicine [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=102.82s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=106.66s)]
*  So we need this so desperately to be able to support [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=107.5s)]
*  our humanitarian partner who in turn are supporting [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=110.04s)]
*  the people of Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  And Administrator, you've said in the past [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=113.76s)]
*  that delivering aid is critically important aid [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=115.04s)]
*  to the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=118.18s)]
*  You said delivering aid by land is in your word everything. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=119.86s)]
*  So why isn't the US using all of its leverage [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  to get Israel to reopen, for example, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=126.42s)]
*  the Rafa border crossing instead of investing in a pier [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=128.4s)]
*  that's breaking down repeatedly [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=132.12s)]
*  and those sporadic air drops? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=134.04s)]
*  Well, we have to take in all of the above strategy, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=138.26s)]
*  but as you say, we have to recognize that land crossings [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=140.8s)]
*  are where you get maximum scale. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=143.96s)]
*  So we are using our leverage with the government of Israel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  Obviously the Israeli Egyptian dialogue on Rafa is ongoing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=151.08s)]
*  It's incredibly important for that crossing point [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=156.36s)]
*  to be open. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=158.44s)]
*  It's incredibly important that the Eretz crossing be used, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=159.28s)]
*  but we have Karim Shalom open and we have the capacity [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=162.24s)]
*  to move trucks by land into Gaza, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=165.0s)]
*  but what's also important is that those convoys [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=167.84s)]
*  be able to move, that they not be looted, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=170.46s)]
*  and by in some cases, desperate civilians, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  but also there are gangs at large there [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=176.3s)]
*  and the conflict itself gets in the way [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=179.18s)]
*  of humanitarian partners being able to do their work. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=181.38s)]
*  With regard to the pier, look, the pier of course [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=183.82s)]
*  has had challenges, weather is a major factor. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=186.9s)]
*  I mean, this is why land is our first preference. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=189.58s)]
*  It's much more reliable, but if we get the pier up [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=191.94s)]
*  and running and get proper throughput [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=194.86s)]
*  going through the maritime pier, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=196.78s)]
*  that's gonna be enough food to feed 500,000 people [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=198.86s)]
*  for a month. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=201.34s)]
*  So this is still an additive part of the solution, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=202.22000000000003s)]
*  but the foundational means of getting food to people [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza has got to be by these land crossings. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  One aid group says, and I'm quoting now, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=210.5s)]
*  the whole humanitarian community has been gaslit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=212.94000000000003s)]
*  into celebrating the tiniest band-aid for a population [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  with countless open wounds. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  How do you respond to that? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=222.44000000000003s)]
*  Well, I don't think, I haven't seen anybody celebrating [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=226.22000000000003s)]
*  anything, Wolf. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=228.38s)]
*  This is the most devastating humanitarian situation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=229.7s)]
*  The fact that so many families have been displaced [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=234.14s)]
*  over and over and over, the fact that you have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=237.06s)]
*  nearly 300 aid workers who have been killed, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  the highest in any conflict, more journalists killed [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=242.18s)]
*  than in any conflict, and of course, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=244.46s)]
*  more than 35,000 civilians, many of whom [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  are women and children. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=249.46s)]
*  There is no celebration happening. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=250.46s)]
*  We don't celebrate incremental progress. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  We recognize that there needs to be a wholesale change, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=254.98s)]
*  and we are hopeful still that a ceasefire will help us [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=258.62s)]
*  bring about that change and see the kind of massive surge. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  But it's not just about getting assistance to people, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=265.06s)]
*  it's about lives of safety and dignity, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=266.98s)]
*  which are lives that the people of Gaza [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=269.96s)]
*  have not enjoyed for some time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=271.74s)]
*  We did some checking, Administrator. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=273.78s)]
*  There's not been a single day in more than eight months [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=275.56s)]
*  of war where the basic needs of the Palestinian people [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=278.38s)]
*  in Gaza, we're talking about at least 500 trucks [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=281.5s)]
*  according to the United Nations, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=285.62s)]
*  has made it inside Gaza into civilians' hands. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=290.36s)]
*  Well, we need more crossings open. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=294.0s)]
*  We need a more efficient and effective system [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=296.52000000000004s)]
*  inside Gaza for these trucks to move. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=301.04s)]
*  There are endless delays at checkpoints, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=303.16s)]
*  and we need across the entire Israeli system [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  there to be a full buy-in about the strategic importance, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=310.02s)]
*  the moral importance of reaching people in need. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=313.7s)]
*  And again, we've made huge progress [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  from where we were at the beginning, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=320.06s)]
*  but we're not meeting basic needs, and that has to change. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=321.34s)]
*  So critically important. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=325.94s)]
*  Samantha Power, the AID Administrator, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=327.26s)]
*  thanks so much for joining us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Wolf. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCxMyVIprCg&t=332.91999999999996s)]
