# Former IDF soldier believes Israel is making 'a catastrophic mistake' in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08)
*  Welcome to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=0.0s)]
*  You've been listening to some of the reporting [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=2.24s)]
*  just airing just before you, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=5.44s)]
*  and you're obviously seeing everything [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=7.2s)]
*  that's going on around you. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=8.64s)]
*  Tell me first, what has been going through your head [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=11.28s)]
*  and your heart since October 7th? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=15.22s)]
*  Well, since October 7th, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=23.52s)]
*  everything has changed in some ways, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=25.42s)]
*  and in other ways, everything is... [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=28.78s)]
*  My worst fears are coming true. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=32.42s)]
*  I, as you mentioned, I fought in Gaza in 2014. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=35.86s)]
*  That war was also preceded by a horrific terrorist attack, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=41.86s)]
*  just like we saw on October 7th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=45.94s)]
*  Three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and murdered, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=48.3s)]
*  which led to a... [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=50.900000000000006s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=53.34s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=55.36000000000001s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=56.36000000000001s)]
*  Don't worry. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=57.36000000000001s)]
*  Which led to a horrific... [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=59.36000000000001s)]
*  Which led to the firing of rockets, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=62.38s)]
*  a massive crackdown on Hamas in the West Bank [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=65.38000000000001s)]
*  and firing of rockets and then a ground invasion. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=68.38000000000001s)]
*  The images that everyone is seeing, that I'm seeing, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=71.38s)]
*  remind me very vividly of that fighting. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=77.38s)]
*  And frankly, it's my worst fears [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=80.38s)]
*  because many people, colleagues in the Israeli peace camp, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  in the Israeli anti-occupation camp, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  have been warning for so many years, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=91.46000000000001s)]
*  saying that there is no military solution. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=93.46000000000001s)]
*  We can't just manage the conflict [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  and maintain a very, very brutal military regime [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=98.48s)]
*  of control over Palestinians [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=104.48s)]
*  that actually plays into the hands of Hamas [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=106.48s)]
*  and plays into the hands of these murderous terrorist groups. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=108.48s)]
*  And so all I've been doing since then is trying to share my message, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=112.56s)]
*  try to share my experience, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=117.56s)]
*  and try to avoid making the same mistakes that we made in 2014 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=118.56s)]
*  when Hamas only got stronger after we bombed them [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=123.54s)]
*  and killed thousands and we struck them a decisive blow, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=127.54s)]
*  or that's at least what I thought at the time, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=132.54s)]
*  but I only saw afterwards that my own government strengthened Hamas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=134.54s)]
*  You know, it's pretty intense to hear you say that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=138.54000000000002s)]
*  Look, we know that the majority of your country right now [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  is in favor of this war. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  They might not be in favor of the current government, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  but they definitely believe that somehow, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  somewhere, Hamas has to be defeated. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  You're saying it can't be done militarily. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  Tell us, I guess the first question really is to you, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  are you out of step with the majority of your country people right now? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  And are you able still to talk about, you know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  what you saw, what you feel, what you've learned, how you've changed? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=170.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'll add, you know, I'm not a pacifist. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=179.72s)]
*  I believe that Israel has the responsibility to defend itself against Hamas, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=183.72s)]
*  and of course, that includes military actions, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=187.72s)]
*  but I think that right now in Israeli society, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=190.72s)]
*  there's a debate going on as to whether this war that we're fighting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=193.72s)]
*  should be against Hamas or it should be against the Palestinian people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=197.8s)]
*  And you have members of this current government [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=202.8s)]
*  who have said since the horrific atrocities that we saw [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=206.8s)]
*  on October 7th against Israeli civilians [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=209.8s)]
*  and the kidnapping of Israeli civilians who are still being held, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=212.8s)]
*  they have made it clear that they aren't differentiating [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=215.8s)]
*  between civilians and Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=220.8s)]
*  Even last night, a senior member of the coalition, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=223.8s)]
*  sorry, on Saturday night, senior member of the coalition [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  of the member of the cabinet, Bitzalel Smutritz, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=229.88000000000002s)]
*  the finance minister and the minister overseeing the West Bank [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  and the Ministry of Defense said that he doesn't really see [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=236.88000000000002s)]
*  a big difference between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  The Arabs are the same Arabs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=242.88000000000002s)]
*  So there are many Israelis who disagree with that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=244.88000000000002s)]
*  and there are many Israelis who are questioning the assumptions [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  and questioning the lies that they've been told for so many years [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=251.88000000000002s)]
*  and maybe it is a majority who has believed the lies [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=254.96s)]
*  that our government has told us. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=257.96s)]
*  But I think that this is an opportunity for partners of mine [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=260.96s)]
*  in the Israeli peace camp. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=266.96s)]
*  I saw many of my... [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=269.96s)]
*  Yes? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=272.96s)]
*  I can hear you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=275.96s)]
*  Let me ask you another question, Bensi. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=278.96s)]
*  Let me ask you another question. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=281.96s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  Bensi, your line has dropped. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  We're going to redial you and we're going to bring you back. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  We're going to bring you back, OK? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  So stand by and we'll bring you back. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=294.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to ask you again about the op-ed, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  the article you wrote for the New York Times [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  describing what it was like, you know, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  in the deployment in 2014 in Gaza. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  You wrote, you know, that some of your soldiers [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  were feeling doubts at that time [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=308.03999999999996s)]
*  and then you wrote your own thoughts on a piece of paper [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  and you wrote this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=313.12s)]
*  I wrote that some members of my team had been tallying [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=315.12s)]
*  the number of soldiers killed [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=318.12s)]
*  and discussing whether this operation was worth the losses. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=320.12s)]
*  I think it could be worth it, I wrote, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=323.12s)]
*  as long as we decisively eliminate the threat. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=325.12s)]
*  That's the lie they told us [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=328.12s)]
*  and the lie that's being repeated today, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=330.12s)]
*  that we can decisively eliminate the threat of Hamas [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=332.12s)]
*  through a military operation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=335.12s)]
*  Bensi, how did you come to the conclusion that you couldn't? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=338.12s)]
*  Well, you know, one of the voices [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=341.2s)]
*  that I've listened to over the years [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=344.2s)]
*  and I've been convinced by is not just the voices [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=346.2s)]
*  of human rights activists, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=349.2s)]
*  but also the voice of the former head of the Shin Bet, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=351.2s)]
*  Amir Ayalon, who's the top counter-terrorism expert [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=353.2s)]
*  for four and a half years in the country. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=357.2s)]
*  And he said this openly. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=360.2s)]
*  He said the only way to decisively defeat [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=362.2s)]
*  the threat of Hamas is to be able to do it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=365.2s)]
*  He said this openly. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=368.28s)]
*  He said the only way to decisively defeat [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=369.28s)]
*  the terrorism that Hamas represents [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=372.28s)]
*  is through creating an alternative and creating hope. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=375.28s)]
*  And that means working towards a political solution. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=378.28s)]
*  And our current government has been fundamentally committed [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=381.28s)]
*  to opposing a political solution [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=386.28s)]
*  and to preventing the creation of a Palestinian state [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=388.28s)]
*  and preventing Palestinian independence. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=392.28s)]
*  So therefore, that's why I realized [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=394.28s)]
*  military alone will not defeat Hamas. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's why I think that our government [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  needs to be changed immediately. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=402.35999999999996s)]
*  So let me ask you then as well, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  because you talk a lot in your op-ed [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=406.35999999999996s)]
*  about what you saw in Gaza in 2014. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=408.35999999999996s)]
*  Tell me, because earlier you said [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  you don't believe that the soldiers [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=413.35999999999996s)]
*  distinguish carefully enough [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  between civilians and Hamas fighters. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  What did you yourself experience to make you say that? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=420.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, you know, in the area that we went, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  we were told that all the civilians had fled [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=430.35999999999996s)]
*  and that was true for the most part, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=433.35999999999996s)]
*  but it wasn't entirely true. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  We did find civilians. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=436.35999999999996s)]
*  There was an entire family in the second neighborhood [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=438.35999999999996s)]
*  that my unit took over. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=440.35999999999996s)]
*  There was an entire family who stayed behind. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  And the soldiers, you know, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  luckily when they entered the house, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=446.35999999999996s)]
*  they didn't kill them through live fire. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=448.35999999999996s)]
*  They gave them food and water. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  They guarded them for many days. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=452.35999999999996s)]
*  But when we pulled down the door, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=454.35999999999996s)]
*  but when we pulled out, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=456.44s)]
*  the Air Force flew overhead [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=457.44s)]
*  and bombed the entire neighborhood. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=459.44s)]
*  And eight members of that family were killed. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=461.44s)]
*  I learned this later. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=464.44s)]
*  So I've seen this with my own eyes. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=465.44s)]
*  And I'm listening today. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=467.44s)]
*  I'm listening to my own leaders, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=468.44s)]
*  including who I mentioned, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=470.44s)]
*  Bitzal El-Smotrich, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=472.44s)]
*  who said he doesn't really differentiate [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=473.44s)]
*  between the Palestinian Authority, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=475.44s)]
*  which recognizes Israel [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=477.44s)]
*  and wants to negotiate with Israel, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=478.44s)]
*  and Hamas, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=480.44s)]
*  which is the terrorist organization [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=481.44s)]
*  that carried out these atrocities. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=483.44s)]
*  The Arabs are the Arabs. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=485.52s)]
*  That's what he said on Saturday night [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=486.52s)]
*  on Israeli television. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=488.52s)]
*  So it's hard for me to believe. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=489.52s)]
*  I don't believe that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=491.52s)]
*  I've seen it with my own eyes. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=492.52s)]
*  I don't believe that Israel [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=493.52s)]
*  is doing everything in its power [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=494.52s)]
*  to prevent civilian casualties [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=496.52s)]
*  based on the statements [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=497.52s)]
*  of members of the Likud [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=498.52s)]
*  and other members of the coalition. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=499.52s)]
*  And I think that that's a result of the fact [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=501.52s)]
*  that this government doesn't view [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=503.52s)]
*  the Palestinian people [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=505.52s)]
*  as the future partners [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=506.52s)]
*  for making peace with. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=508.52s)]
*  And they are just convinced [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=509.52s)]
*  that overwhelming military power [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=511.52s)]
*  is going to bring us safety [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=513.52s)]
*  and security. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=514.6s)]
*  And this is a catastrophic mistake. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=515.6s)]
*  It's the same catastrophic mistake [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=517.6s)]
*  that led us to the horrific [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=519.6s)]
*  events of October 7th. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=521.6s)]
*  And we absolutely need to change that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=524.6s)]
*  We need our partners abroad. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=526.6s)]
*  We need the U.S. government. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=528.6s)]
*  Also, I'm an Israeli, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=529.6s)]
*  but I'm also an American. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=530.6s)]
*  And I expect that the American government [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=532.6s)]
*  also not just pays lip service [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=534.6s)]
*  to the idea of pursuing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=536.6s)]
*  a political solution. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=538.6s)]
*  Settlements are expanding [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=539.6s)]
*  at an incredible rate [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=541.6s)]
*  Settlers are illegally taking over land [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=543.6800000000001s)]
*  not even according to international law [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  according to Israeli law. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  They're going out [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  and they're shooting at [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  Palestinian civilians [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  and there's no [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  with impunity [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  there's no real enforcement [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=554.6800000000001s)]
*  against them. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  And so I think [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  our international partners [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  and allies need to take a stance [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  on the side of the Israelis [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  who are demanding political solution [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=564.6800000000001s)]
*  and are demanding differentiation [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  and that our government [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  make sure not to harm [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=571.76s)]
*  and kill innocent civilians. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=574.76s)]
*  Bensi, obviously they tell us endlessly [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=577.76s)]
*  that they are doing their best [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=579.76s)]
*  but you can see allies [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=581.76s)]
*  like the United States [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=583.76s)]
*  are getting increasingly worried [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=584.76s)]
*  not to mention everybody on the ground [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=585.76s)]
*  about the civilian toll. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=587.76s)]
*  There are stories [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=589.76s)]
*  a lot about dissent [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=591.76s)]
*  being quashed in Israel. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=593.76s)]
*  Are you not worried [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=595.76s)]
*  about what you're saying to me [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=596.76s)]
*  publicly now [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=598.76s)]

*  You know [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=609.84s)]
*  it's a risk that I have to take [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=610.84s)]
*  for the future of the people [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=612.84s)]

*  helping Hamas. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=673.0s)]

*  and what you've just said [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=678.0s)]
*  has been confirmed [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xliqJ6pxx08&t=679.0s)]
