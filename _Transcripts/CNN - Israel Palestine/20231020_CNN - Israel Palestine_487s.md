# Attacks on US military in Middle East stoke fear of regional war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM)
*  There are new signs this morning that the Israeli Defense Force could move into Gaza at any minute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=0.0s)]
*  CNN has seen a buildup of military right along the border and now flares late into the night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=4.64s)]
*  This comes as Israeli government officials tell CNN's Nick Robertson that the troops have the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=10.64s)]
*  quote, green light to enter Gaza. Now those officials also say that Gaza's 50-mile border [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=15.76s)]
*  with Israel will look radically different after any military incursion. They tell CNN that a tough [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=20.48s)]
*  buffer zone will be established, one that would essentially be a no-go zone, and the IDF will be [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=25.36s)]
*  able to go into Gaza and arrest people whenever they want. It's theoretically on their terms, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=30.32s)]
*  much like they can now in the West Bank. Joining us now with the Magic Wall, CNN military analyst, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=35.44s)]
*  retired Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling. Sir, good to see you. I want to start with the flares [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=39.12s)]
*  because Nick Robertson was pointing this out, we'll show a video of it right now, and he made [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  clear that that's not the norm necessarily in this moment. What does that tell you? It just tells me [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  that the Israeli forces are looking for something or they're trying to use a little bit of [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=51.68s)]
*  psychological warfare against the people inside of Gaza. This is not that big of a deal. It is [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=57.12s)]
*  just to show potentially the commanders that are on the scene where different crossing points are, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=64.0s)]
*  what they're looking for. It's to orient those who are new to the area. Big question is will this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=68.88s)]
*  become a regional conflict? The president talked about that last night. Let's talk about what we [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=74.24s)]
*  have just seen in the region. The fact that two sources told CNN overnight that Navy warships, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=78.4s)]
*  U.S. Navy warships operating in the Middle East had to counter multiple projectiles fired on the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=83.76s)]
*  coast of Yemen yesterday. And then you couple that with what the Pentagon says are drone attack [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=90.48s)]
*  attempts in Iraq and where U.S. officials are in Iraq and Syria. Yeah, a couple things that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  happened yesterday. The drone attack off the coast of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden down [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=101.92s)]
*  here against the USS Carney drew a lot of attention. Integrated air defense from that ship [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=107.52s)]
*  shot the drones and the missiles down that were coming out of Yemen. That's important, but the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=112.24s)]
*  range from there to Israel is pretty far and they don't have a great missile force, let's put it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=118.24s)]
*  that way. But the other things that were occurring would be a normal day in some countries like the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=124.96s)]
*  drone attack at Al-Tanf in Syria. That is a U.S. military base in that particular reason. It's been [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=131.28s)]
*  there for a while. Other drone attacks, Al-Assad Air Force Base, I've been out there many times [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  in Iraq, Erbil, Baghdad, and in the southern part of Iraq just tells me that the popular [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=143.2s)]
*  mobilization fronts, the Iranian-backed rebels, are actually targeting those kinds of locations [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=149.12s)]
*  just as harassment attacks. There was also two Israeli citizens killed in Egypt, which just shows [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=155.36s)]
*  that there's a swell of a ground movement that is a result of some of the things that have been [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  going on there and all of these Arab street does not want Israel to go into Gaza. Can you just take [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  a step back to what your point has been? And I think it's very valuable to note that these bases, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  these U.S. bases are often harassed or often subject to drone attacks or rocket attacks. All of it [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=177.60000000000002s)]
*  happening on the same day, the same day the president gives an Oval Office address as Israel [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=183.52s)]
*  is preparing for what looks like a ground incursion. Different proxies from Iran, but does that tell you [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=188.96s)]
*  something? Yeah, it's a call for harassment, it's a call for attacks, it is a jihad. They are receiving [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=195.36s)]
*  information from Iran saying, let's up the ante a little bit and show our displeasure at what's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  going on in Israel. Moments ago a large group of people were seen rallying for the opening of the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=207.92s)]
*  Rafah crossing on the Egypt border. You can see this, this is right outside that border, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  a few miles around that crossing, there's craters in front of it. We understand about 20 trucks, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=220.48s)]
*  some of those drivers have told us they actually saw the Egyptian moving concrete as if there was [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  a maybe the possibility of it opening, but subsequently CNN has learned that the Rafah [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  crossing will not open today as had been anticipated. But that sense of on the ground [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=234.32s)]
*  and that terrain, that desert gives you some perspective on where we stand right now. Just [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  moments ago we did hear from the UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez who is at the Rafah border [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=246.32s)]
*  crossing on the Egyptian side, so he is there. You've got a UN compound on the other side where [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=252.56s)]
*  we know people are better supplied than most places, but still with dwindling, dwindling supplies. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=257.6s)]
*  And of course he's standing where all those trucks loaded with aid are waiting to enter. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=263.36s)]
*  Behind these walls we have two million people that is suffering enormously. So these trucks [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=268.88000000000005s)]
*  are not just trucks, they are a lifeline. They are the difference between life and death [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=278.16s)]
*  for so many people in Gaza. What we need is to make them move, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=286.56s)]
*  to make them move to the other side of this wall, to make them move as quickly as possible. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  So those cement blocks that I referenced, we actually have video of that. CNN has obtained [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=303.52000000000004s)]
*  that from some of these truck drivers who are sitting there night upon night and waiting, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  moving those blocks at the entrance of the crossing. There are those 20 trucks, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=312.72s)]
*  they are expected to enter once the crossing opens. The United Nations is saying that it needs [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=316.56s)]
*  though 100 trucks a day to provide adequate aid to the people inside Gaza. 20 trucks right now and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=321.04s)]
*  they need 100 a day. This comes as Gaza's main medical facility is in danger of running out of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=329.28000000000003s)]
*  fuel within hours. No fuel has been coming into Gaza now for days and of course to run a generator [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  you need fuel. All of that is now running out. Doctors Without Borders said yesterday that the [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=340.56s)]
*  Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City only had enough fuel to run its generators for 24 more hours. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=344.96s)]
*  That hospital is one of the few places in Gaza that actually even has electricity for now. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=351.04s)]
*  On that front we have been getting dispatches from people inside Gaza [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=356.24s)]
*  daily and we get these small clips and they cut out because of the phone connections, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=360.8s)]
*  because they don't have the power. Our journalist Ibrahim Daman escaped northern Gaza [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=366.16s)]
*  south with his wife and two sons. He's been filing these dispatches for out front every night [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=370.16s)]
*  and here's his latest report on the situation in Khan Younis. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=374.48s)]
*  The world is turning into a white cloud. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=400.16s)]
*  something poetic and profound about that horrible image. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=427.68s)]
*  Joining us now is Avril Brunois, the U.S. Executive Director for Doctors Without Borders. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=432.08s)]
*  And Avril, I appreciate speaking with you again. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=435.96s)]
*  I know that you have a team in this main hospital in Gaza, the Al-Shifa Hospital. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  Can you give us any update on their situation? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=442.52s)]
*  Yes, Erin, we are really beside ourselves because we often lose contact with them, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=447.36s)]
*  as you mentioned, with the lack of electricity, the inability to charge phones, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=452.92s)]
*  cell signals often being cut out. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=456.88s)]
*  Very difficult to get real-time information from the team. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=460.28s)]
*  And what we do know is that our medical coordinator was warning that the fuel was [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  reaching catastrophic lows. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=467.67999999999995s)]
*  And of course, they will ration, they will try to stretch it out as much as possible [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=469.91999999999996s)]
*  because you need that fuel to run generators for the life-saving medical equipment, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=473.79999999999995s)]
*  including incubators for neonates, dialysis machines and just just general functioning [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=478.67999999999995s)]
*  for all the trauma surgeries that they're trying to do. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POm7qqRaNnM&t=483.96s)]
