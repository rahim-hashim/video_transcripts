# 'Shocking' Watch Blinken react to footage of Hamas terrorist attack on family
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI)
*  We start with Secretary of State Antony Blinken's powerful message in Israel today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=0.0s)]
*  He was visibly shaken describing more horrific images that he was just shown by Israelis [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=4.8s)]
*  from the barbaric Hamas terror attack on innocent civilian families on October 7. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=11.84s)]
*  I saw, for example, a family on a kibbutz, a father, two young boys, maybe 10, 11 years [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=19.52s)]
*  old, grabbing them, pulling them out of their living room, going through their very small [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=29.04s)]
*  backyard and into a shelter, followed seconds later by a terrorist who throws a grenade [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=36.32s)]
*  into that small shelter. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=45.68s)]
*  And then as the father comes staggering out, shoots him down. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=48.44s)]
*  And then the boys come out and they run into their house and the camera in the house is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=53.64s)]
*  filming everything. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=62.44s)]
*  And they're crying. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=64.24s)]
*  Where's daddy? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=65.24s)]
*  One says. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=68.08s)]
*  The other says they killed daddy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=69.08s)]
*  Where's my mommy? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=71.32s)]
*  And then the terrorist comes in and casually opens the refrigerator and starts to eat from [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=73.68s)]
*  it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=78.48s)]
*  That's what we're dealing with. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=81.4s)]
*  And it is striking and in some ways shocking that the brutality of the slaughter has receded [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=86.04s)]
*  so quickly in the memories of so many. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=95.4s)]
*  Blinken also spoke of young Palestinian children pulled from the wreckage of buildings in Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  When I look into their eyes through the TV screen, I see my own children. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=107.24s)]
*  How can we not? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=114.64s)]
*  Hamas doesn't care one second or one iota for the welfare, for the well-being of the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=117.88s)]
*  Palestinian people. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=124.44s)]
*  It cynically and monstrously uses them as human shields, putting its commanders in command [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=126.11999999999999s)]
*  its weapons and ammunition within or beneath residential buildings, schools, mosques, hospitals. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=134.16s)]
*  But civilians should not suffer the consequences for its inhumanity and its brutality. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=142.48s)]
*  As you can hear that the emotion is palpable, calling Blinken's task complicated is almost [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=149.04s)]
*  an insult to the difficulty of the policy hurdles and trying to navigate the near impossible [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=154.26s)]
*  amidst a sea of anger and despair. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=159.54s)]
*  CNN's Jeremy Diamond is now joining us from Sarod in signed Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=162.52s)]
*  Jeremy, the visit is not stopping what is going on on the ground there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=166.36s)]
*  Jeremy, I want to try to bring you in now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=172.68s)]
*  I know there is a lot happening right where you are. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=174.72s)]
*  This is what we're looking at our live pictures. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=178.84s)]
*  Yes, we can hear you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=180.8s)]
*  Tell us what's happening there. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=182.4s)]
*  Hey, Dana. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=183.88s)]
*  So we are on a hill overlooking the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  Right here you have a lot of media that are actually set up. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=189.44s)]
*  We had a siren go off just moments ago and actually there was a hit, it appears, on a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  vehicle nearby. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=197.56s)]
*  We are standing, again, there's a lot of media here because this is one of the overlook points [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=199.6s)]
*  to look into the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=203.73999999999998s)]
*  And what you're seeing, let's just get closer to some of the damage if we can here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=206.12s)]
*  You see there's obviously a lot of press. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=210.04s)]
*  It's quite a scrum here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=212.32s)]
*  This car appears to have been blown out by some kind of a rocket perhaps or an interception. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=214.82s)]
*  Shrapnel may have fallen, but what we heard was a very, very loud boom. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  It appeared to be some kind of an impact falling directly on this vehicle or near it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=224.62s)]
*  Trying to get a better look, Dana, because I don't want to get the facts wrong here. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=233.26s)]
*  But you can see that obviously this vehicle, there's quite a lot of damage to it and we [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  heard a very loud impact. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=244.1s)]
*  Let me walk around this way with my cameraman, Matias, if he can follow me here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=245.1s)]
*  We heard a loud boom. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=251.85999999999999s)]
*  We have not seen any pieces of the rocket at this point and so it's possible that there [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  was some kind of an interception right overhead and shrapnel may have fallen to hit this vehicle. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=257.42s)]
*  It's very hard to tell right now, Dana, but obviously this is one of the realities here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=262.42s)]
*  The Iron Dome system obviously takes out the overwhelming majority of those rockets, but [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  some of them do get through and in some cases you also have to be aware of the shrapnel [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=272.38s)]
*  that may fall down. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=276.38s)]
*  Obviously this is turning into a bit of a circus here, so I'm going to take us kind [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=279.94s)]
*  of closer this way. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=284.26s)]
*  But you can see that there's some damage here as well on this vehicle, which may have been [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=285.26s)]
*  due to shrapnel falling. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=289.06s)]
*  And so this is the reality of the situation here, Dana. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=293.98s)]
*  And Jeremy, understanding that this just happened just before you came on air with [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=299.3s)]
*  us, I want you to go back to an important point that you made, which is you are in Israel. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=304.3s)]
*  You are near the border with Gaza. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=311.18s)]
*  And the Hamas, the terrorists in Hamas who still have the ability, the capability, despite [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=314.1s)]
*  the civilians not having water or electricity and what have you, capability somehow to shoot [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=324.1s)]
*  missiles or whatever kind of attack that they just tried to launch inside Israel. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=332.3s)]
*  And what happens regularly, sorry Jeremy, what happens regularly is that because Israel [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=339.70000000000005s)]
*  has what's called the Iron Dome and the ability to intercept what comes in, it keeps, for [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=345.1s)]
*  the most part, it keeps Israel safe, but it's not foolproof and there is shrapnel. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=350.98s)]
*  Understandably, and as I said, we aren't sure whether this was a direct hit to this vehicle. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=357.98s)]
*  To me this seems like most likely some shrapnel that hit this vehicle just given the scale [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  of the damage, but it is hard to tell. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=369.14000000000004s)]
*  Some of these rockets are actually not that, don't have that much explosive on them, some [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=371.08000000000004s)]
*  of these rockets that Hamas uses. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=376.54s)]
*  And so it's a little bit difficult to tell at times if it's just shrapnel, if it was [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=378.58s)]
*  a direct hit, but what I can tell you is that we had seconds to react here. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=381.38s)]
*  We heard that siren maybe three to five seconds later. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=385.38s)]
*  We heard a very, very loud boom coming from right where we are right now and you can hear [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  some of the car alarms still going off. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  But I do want to, as we talk about this and as we talk about some of the damage that has [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=397.88s)]
*  happened here, we should also keep in mind the damage that is happening inside of Gaza [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=401.46s)]
*  as well, where Israeli strikes, bombs, missiles, targeting Hamas command centers, many of them [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=405.78s)]
*  underground, but also targeting residential buildings where Israeli forces say that Hamas [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=412.78s)]
*  fighters have embedded themselves. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=417.26s)]
*  In Gaza they don't have an early warning system. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=419.11999999999995s)]
*  In Gaza they don't have bomb shelters to rush into as we were able to do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=421.41999999999996s)]
*  And we have watched, of course, as the toll of casualties in Gaza has really mounted quite [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=425.58s)]
*  substantially over these last three and a half weeks of war. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=430.14s)]
*  So I do think that that's something we keep in mind, especially as there's quite a scrum of media here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=434.58000000000004s)]
*  And one of the reasons everyone is here is because, again, these positions over here is where [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=439.18s)]
*  we are posted to kind of watch the activity inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=443.18s)]
*  Dana? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=448.42s)]
*  All right, Jeremy, stay safe, please. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=449.62s)]
*  I know you don't need me to tell you that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=452.14000000000004s)]
*  But also I just want to say that this is happening while, again, as I just played at the beginning [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=454.42s)]
*  of the show, the U.S. Secretary of State is there, is in the region, not where Jeremy is. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=459.62s)]
*  But is in Israel. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=464.22s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8adDjfFKfwI&t=466.3s)]
