# Dana Bash presses Netanyahu on allowing humanitarian aid to Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [March 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE)
*  Mr. Prime Minister, I want to talk about why the sentiment has changed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously there has been huge support and still is really big support here in the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=5.04s)]
*  U.S. and in most corners of the world for you doing what you are saying. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=10.92s)]
*  Your strategic goal is to defeat Hamas and to make sure that that kind of terror attack [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=15.36s)]
*  doesn't happen again. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=20.56s)]
*  But what is happening and the reason why the world is shifting in public sentiment is the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=22.16s)]
*  humanitarian crisis in Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=27.56s)]
*  Organizations call what they are seeing near famine in Gaza. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=31.32s)]
*  So why won't you allow more food trucks to drive through the border crossings into Gaza [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=35.2s)]
*  to feed starving civilians while you continue to take out the terrorists in Hamas? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=40.64s)]
*  Well, our policy is to do exactly that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  We've enabled our policies to not have famine but to have the entry of humanitarian support [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=53.16s)]
*  as needed and as much as is needed. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=59.559999999999995s)]
*  So we've allowed, we've created alternative routes, supply routes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  We allow the dropping of the support from the air, humanitarian aid, a sea route that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=65.82s)]
*  we've cooperated with and it started yesterday, and alternative land routes that we're enabling [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=71.08s)]
*  again. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=76.56s)]
*  The problem isn't getting the trucks in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=77.56s)]
*  The problem is that once they're getting in, they're looted by Hamas or looted by gangs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=79.84s)]
*  And what we're trying to do with some other powers is to try to get the aid to the actual [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=84.8s)]
*  civilians who need them and not looted by Hamas. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=92.32s)]
*  That's really the problem. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=95.12s)]
*  In any case, that's our policy and that's why I've enabled alternative routes of supply. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=96.12s)]
*  There's been a trickle, I mean to be fair, of supply going in there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=104.6s)]
*  And every major NGO, outside organization involved with this crisis says that the level [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=108.72s)]
*  of hunger is life-threatening for hundreds of thousands. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=114.24s)]
*  Cindy McCain, who, the McCain family, they have been long supporters of Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=118.08s)]
*  She is now the executive director of the World Food Program. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=122.8s)]
*  She says that hunger has reached catastrophic levels in northern Gaza. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=125.7s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=131.36s)]
*  Only a fraction of the food needed is trickling. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=132.48s)]
*  To prevent an outright famine, they need significant increase in humanitarian aid. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=136.12s)]
*  Now millions of lives are at stake. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=140.4s)]
*  Will you do that? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=143.8s)]
*  Will you commit to that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=144.8s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=145.8s)]
*  And we're doing it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=146.8s)]
*  Again, I've authorized alternative routes of supply. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=147.8s)]
*  And again, the problem is not the number of trucks going in, although we're increasing [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=154.24s)]
*  it on a daily basis. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=158.0s)]
*  I think the problem is preventing the looting by Hamas and by others. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  That's what we're working on now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it's a cooperative effort. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=165.28s)]
*  Our policy is to enable humanitarian aid. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=166.92s)]
*  That's been a constant element in our whole program. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=169.64s)]
*  To destroy Hamas militarily, but also to supply the humanitarian aid simultaneously. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  With respect, though, sir, it's not happening. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=179.04s)]
*  And the main obstacle to that is actually Hamas. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=180.04s)]
*  It's not happening. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=183.32s)]
*  Well, in the north, you said that you've destroyed Hamas. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=184.32s)]
*  If Hamas isn't in the north, then how is Hamas taking away food? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=186.72s)]
*  And if you open up more border crossings and give more food into the area, allow starving [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=191.0s)]
*  people to eat, the looting maybe would subside. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=198.32s)]
*  That's human nature, no? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=201.76s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening, because we have increased the number of trucks entering [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=206.56s)]
*  the north. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=210.36s)]
*  I think I'm up to date, and I know these numbers. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=211.36s)]
*  And we know that there is an increase, but we also know that we have a job to do to prevent [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=214.6s)]
*  the looting. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=220.24s)]
*  Because at the end, we bring in the trucks, including to the north, and then they're looted [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=221.24s)]
*  by remaining Hamas terrorists. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=225.08s)]
*  We've destroyed the fighting formations of Hamas, the terrorist battalions, but there's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=226.76s)]
*  still individual terrorists that we're mopping up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  And these individual terrorists shoot the drivers, shoot the drivers, take over the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=233.84s)]
*  goods, and try to give it to Hamas fighters, the remaining Hamas fighters. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=237.96s)]
*  So it's an ongoing battle. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  But you understand that it is the responsibility. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  You're destroying Hamas and giving humanitarian aid. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=247.28s)]
*  Forgive me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=250.32s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=251.32s)]
*  Given the images that I'm sure you have seen, do you believe fundamentally that it is Israel's [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=253.88s)]
*  responsibility to make sure that those starving civilians, including those children, get food, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=260.64s)]
*  and you're doing everything in your power to make sure that happens? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=267.96s)]
*  Categorically, yes. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=271.76s)]
*  I think it's an effort that we're engaged in all the time. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=276.35999999999996s)]
*  I think that Hamas is working on the opposite effort. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=280.55999999999995s)]
*  One, to get people not to leave war zones. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=283.44s)]
*  They want more civilian casualties. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  We want to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=288.55999999999995s)]
*  And the second, they want to commandeer the humanitarian aid and bring it to their underground [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=290.91999999999996s)]
*  terror tunnels, and we want it to reach the Palestinian population. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=295.96s)]
*  So the blame should be laid squarely at Hamas' door. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=299.96s)]
*  And instead, I find it both cynical and wrong, just factually wrong, to try to place the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=303.22s)]
*  blame on Israel, which is doing everything it can to minimize civilian casualties and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=309.1s)]
*  to get to humanitarian aid, and Hamas, which is doing the opposite, instead of placing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=313.38000000000005s)]
*  the blame on Hamas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=317.5s)]
*  We'll continue to do it, regardless of the PR distortions. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=318.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=323.22s)]
*  I mean, I think there is no question that Hamas is a nefarious organization doing everything [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=324.22s)]
*  it can to undermine what's going on and to create chaos. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=330.42s)]
*  But I guess the point is that you're not Hamas. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=334.18s)]
*  Israel is a democracy and as a Jewish state, supports and believes in every life mattering. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=336.98s)]
*  And so I'm glad to hear that you say that you're going to do what you can to get those [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=344.94s)]
*  aid trucks in. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=348.58000000000004s)]
*  And obviously, we'll be watching. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=349.58000000000004s)]
*  And I'm sure a lot of organizations are going to be happy to hear what you said today. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=351.04s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  I appreciate your time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=356.14s)]
*  Thank you, Donald. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=360.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0d9CCDGBSgE&t=361.54s)]
