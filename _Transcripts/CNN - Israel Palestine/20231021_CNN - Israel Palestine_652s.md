# CNN reporter takes a look inside Gaza hospitals 'on the brink of collapse'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo)
*  CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joining us now with the latest. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=0.0s)]
*  Salma, Gaza's hospital are facing, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=3.24s)]
*  the hospitals there, they're facing severe shortages [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=6.88s)]
*  and of course there's no fuel on these aid trucks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=8.76s)]
*  What more can you tell us about the aid that's coming in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=11.76s)]
*  and how that is going to play out? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=14.74s)]
*  I think it's crucial we put this aid into context. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=18.6s)]
*  We understand from local officials [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  that these 20 trucks are 3%, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=24.32s)]
*  just 3% of what was normally coming in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=27.16s)]
*  on a single day in Gaza before this crisis even began. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=30.8s)]
*  And these trucks have to distribute this aid [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=35.84s)]
*  as airstrikes continue to rain down without fuel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=38.2s)]
*  to put into these trucks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=42.08s)]
*  And they're filling this huge gap, this huge deficit. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=44.72s)]
*  Hospitals are running out of medicine, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=48.68s)]
*  kids are drinking seawater [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=50.44s)]
*  because there's no clean drinking water. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=51.8s)]
*  The humanitarian crisis is just huge. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  I want you to take a look at the situation on the ground. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=57.16s)]
*  I do warn you, these images are graphic [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=60.4s)]
*  as these aid convoys enter Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=63.31999999999999s)]
*  Hospitals in Gaza are crumbling. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=69.44s)]
*  Everything is running out [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=72.2s)]
*  from surgical equipment to medicine. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  And the tiniest lives are left hanging in the balance. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=76.36s)]
*  We need power, we need access to clean water. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=80.98s)]
*  This doctor says without basic services, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=85.30000000000001s)]
*  this will be a humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=88.14s)]
*  Already seven hospitals [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=92.26s)]
*  and 21 primary healthcare facilities here [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=93.98s)]
*  are out of service, according to Palestinian officials, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=96.9s)]
*  because of shortages. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=100.18s)]
*  After intense diplomatic efforts, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=103.66s)]
*  prayers of relief at Rafah border crossing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  as a trickle of aid was allowed in from Egypt. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=109.06s)]
*  But the 20 truck convoy is only a drop [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=112.22s)]
*  in the ocean of need here, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=115.42s)]
*  equivalent to just 3% of what entered this enclave daily [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=117.69999999999999s)]
*  prior to the conflict. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=121.86s)]
*  More than 200 additional trucks of assistance [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=124.02s)]
*  remain stalled on the Egyptian side, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=126.78s)]
*  according to the UN. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=129.34s)]
*  And every hour costs lives. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=130.78s)]
*  And so far, no civilians can leave the enclave. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=134.66s)]
*  10-year-old Palestinian American Aiden [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=138.17999999999998s)]
*  is among those trapped. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  And we had no place to go. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  All the streets are bombed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=143.82s)]
*  They're literally gone. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=145.77999999999997s)]
*  How are we supposed to go out? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=148.38s)]
*  How? It's all closed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=151.14s)]
*  Even if people are allowed out, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=153.05999999999997s)]
*  it will be a limited number, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=155.17999999999998s)]
*  most likely only those with foreign passports, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=156.77999999999997s)]
*  sealing some 2 million others, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=159.94s)]
*  half of them children, into this house scape. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=162.1s)]
*  But some refuse to go, even if they could, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=165.9s)]
*  fearing Israel intends to bomb and besiege them [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=169.02s)]
*  out of their homes, never to return. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=171.82s)]
*  Even as Mahmoud buries his children, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=175.42s)]
*  he says he will keep fighting just to exist here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=177.94s)]
*  We will still be patient. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=181.98s)]
*  As long as we are alive on this earth, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=184.38s)]
*  we will be patient, he says. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=186.22s)]
*  We will never leave this land. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=188.34s)]
*  After the October 7 terror attacks, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=191.5s)]
*  when Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  in a brutal surprise incursion, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=197.46s)]
*  Israel vowed to wipe out Hamas. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=199.86s)]
*  But with hundreds of airstrikes [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=203.18s)]
*  pounding the densely populated enclave a day, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  innocent blood is being spilled. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=208.10000000000002s)]
*  Innocent children were struck down while they were sleeping. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=211.58s)]
*  This woman shouts, what did they do? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=214.46s)]
*  Did they carry weapons? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=216.46s)]
*  These are innocent children who know nothing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=217.86s)]
*  Tell us, when will this end? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  There are calls for a ceasefire [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=223.74s)]
*  to get civilians out of the war zone [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=225.5s)]
*  and allow more aid into Gaza. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=227.82000000000002s)]
*  But the pleas fall on deaf ears so far. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=230.54000000000002s)]
*  Israel is preparing for the next phase of its operations, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=233.66s)]
*  a potential ground incursion [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=237.46s)]
*  that can only bring more suffering. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=239.26000000000002s)]
*  Now, when we talk about this trickle of aid, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=245.06s)]
*  I also want you to think about just how much it required [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=247.78s)]
*  to get such a small amount of help into the enclave. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=250.98s)]
*  President Biden was directly involved in these negotiations. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=254.98s)]
*  There was intense diplomatic efforts, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=258.5s)]
*  a flurry between Egypt and Israel and the United States [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=260.7s)]
*  to just bring in this tiny amount of help [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=264.14s)]
*  that, again, aid workers say is going to be used up immediately. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=267.58s)]
*  And we're looking at a humanitarian crisis [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=272.7s)]
*  that isn't just unfolding on the ground [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=274.7s)]
*  but is actually being expanded, added to, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=277.06s)]
*  intensified hour by hour by those airstrikes [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=279.82s)]
*  that continue to push wounded people, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=283.09999999999997s)]
*  displaced people into places where shelters are overwhelmed, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=285.58s)]
*  hospitals are overwhelmed. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=289.78s)]
*  That's the fear here, is that this is simply not enough [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=292.26s)]
*  and there could not be enough coming in the days ahead. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=296.5s)]
*  Salma Abdelaziz with the reporting for us. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=301.78s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=304.17999999999995s)]
*  Joining us now is Cindy McCain, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=305.02s)]
*  Executive Director of World Food Program [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=306.46s)]
*  and former ambassador to the UA agencies [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=309.1s)]
*  for Food and Agriculture. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=311.94s)]
*  Ambassador McCain, thank you for your time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=314.06s)]
*  I wanna fill out the picture of perspective. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=316.46s)]
*  What was sent in on these first 20 trucks [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=319.58s)]
*  compared to what is needed? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=323.5s)]
*  So fill that out for us if you could. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=326.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you for having me [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=330.38s)]
*  and thank you for talking about this issue. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=332.38s)]
*  Container all the trucks were medical supplies. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=336.02s)]
*  Of course, we took in food, water taken in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=338.3s)]
*  and as was said, it was a very small amount, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=342.54s)]
*  it's 20 trucks. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=345.1s)]
*  For this convoy, convoys like this to be sustained [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=349.98s)]
*  and to be safe and continue to run [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=353.7s)]
*  and continue to go into the country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=356.42s)]
*  This is a catastrophe going on on the ground there. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=358.54s)]
*  People are starving to death, there's no water. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=361.90000000000003s)]
*  As you know, there's no electricity, there's no fuel. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=364.26s)]
*  This is right for disease and much, much more. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=367.94s)]
*  So I'm really pleading with the world community [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=371.62s)]
*  to please get in here and help. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=374.94s)]
*  Ambassador, as you've heard from some of our reporters, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=377.42s)]
*  especially Clarissa Ward, who's been there on the ground [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=380.06s)]
*  near the crossing, I mean, she's been saying [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=382.46s)]
*  this is just a drop in the ocean [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=384.18s)]
*  because you have 20 aid trucks coming in. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=386.82s)]
*  Compare that to 450 trucks that have been coming in [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=389.42s)]
*  every single day into Gaza. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=392.46s)]
*  What is the World Food Program? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=394.7s)]
*  What are you doing to, I guess, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=396.58s)]
*  what kind of conversations are you having [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=399.18s)]
*  to open a sustained humanitarian corridor? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=400.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, I have talked to everybody involved that I can find [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=406.85999999999996s)]
*  and that includes the Secretary General, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=410.26s)]
*  as well as our other folks [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=412.06s)]
*  with our various partner agencies around. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=413.9s)]
*  This is something that has got to be sustained and saved [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=416.9s)]
*  and of course, it has to be much more of it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=420.38s)]
*  This cannot be the only or the last convoy. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=423.98s)]
*  It simply can't be. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=427.02000000000004s)]
*  So I'm looking to, I'm hoping the leadership [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=428.94s)]
*  in the various countries around, that surround this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=431.74s)]
*  can help us, help remind the world [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=434.74s)]
*  that we need to get in here to help those [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=436.94s)]
*  who cannot help themselves and are about to starve to death. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=438.62s)]
*  What are you hearing from your partners there in Gaza? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=442.34000000000003s)]
*  I understand that there were dozens of bakeries [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=445.42s)]
*  that the World Food Program partnered with [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=449.18s)]
*  and now there are just a couple that are operational. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=452.02s)]
*  Give us some context on the capabilities [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=455.82s)]
*  once supplies reach people there, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=460.26s)]
*  what they can do with them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=463.46s)]
*  Right, well, first of all, WFP was already in Palestine [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=467.09999999999997s)]
*  and we were already in the area. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=471.62s)]
*  And so our people are still there. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=473.46s)]
*  So what does this mean? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=476.62s)]
*  We have the capability and the logistics ability [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=477.58s)]
*  to bring in large quantities of food, et cetera. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=480.18s)]
*  But right now what's left on the ground, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=483.34000000000003s)]
*  as you know, many of the bakeries were bombed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=485.3s)]
*  Many of them just don't have supplies. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=487.26s)]
*  And the ones that are operational [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=489.42s)]
*  have very minimal ability to do just that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=491.62s)]
*  We are bringing in emergency food rations right now. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=494.54s)]
*  This is food that people can eat immediately, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=497.9s)]
*  do not have to cook. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=500.78000000000003s)]
*  We can sustain themselves a little bit longer [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=502.54s)]
*  until we get the longer lasting items [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=504.86s)]
*  that they need in there. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=507.38s)]
*  But once again, 20 trucks will not do it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=508.74s)]
*  We need, as Clarissa said, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=511.74s)]
*  there are 400 and some trucks going every day. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=513.82s)]
*  We need those 400 and some trucks filled with food [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=516.74s)]
*  to go in every day. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=519.38s)]
*  All right, and in terms of your message [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=521.42s)]
*  to the people on the ground, because logistically, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=524.26s)]
*  I mean, I wonder how this is going to work, right? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=525.98s)]
*  28 trucks coming in, there's way more need than that. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=527.9s)]
*  How, do you know how the people on the ground [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=532.14s)]
*  are gonna prioritize? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=534.34s)]
*  Who gets what? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=535.9s)]
*  Well, in the case of World Food Program, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=539.74s)]
*  that's what we do. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=542.38s)]
*  We prioritize, we know where it needs to go, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=544.02s)]
*  we know where the people are also staying [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=546.1800000000001s)]
*  with regards to hospitals, community centers, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=549.02s)]
*  where they've been, where they've fled to. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=551.5s)]
*  So we're gonna make sure that the food gets right [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=553.62s)]
*  where it's supposed to go, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=555.7s)]
*  and that it makes it to the correct people. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=556.78s)]
*  Let's be very clear about that. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=559.0600000000001s)]
*  We have the kind of capabilities [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=560.94s)]
*  to track and trace our food. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=562.54s)]
*  And more importantly, we are able to, on the ground, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=564.5s)]
*  make sure that our beneficiaries are the real beneficiaries [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=567.34s)]
*  that should be getting the food. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=570.5400000000001s)]
*  So we're going to do everything we can [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=572.46s)]
*  to make sure it goes right where it's supposed to go. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=574.38s)]
*  And that's what WFP is good at. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=576.94s)]
*  We're good at logistics, we're good at this. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=578.58s)]
*  And so that's why we're the largest organization, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=580.94s)]
*  that's why we continue to do the kind of work that we do. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=584.0600000000001s)]
*  Most Americans first met you when your late husband, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=588.74s)]
*  Senator John McCain, was running for president. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=592.0200000000001s)]
*  He was the Republican nominee in 2008. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=594.6600000000001s)]
*  One of the candidates for the nomination, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  this time around Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=599.14s)]
*  has said that not a single dollar of US aid [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=601.7s)]
*  should go into Gaza. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=604.7800000000001s)]
*  I wonder what your reaction to that is. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=607.46s)]
*  Listen, it's not just Gaza. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=612.1800000000001s)]
*  This problem is worldwide. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=613.82s)]
*  We have the Sahel, we have Sudan, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=615.5s)]
*  we have hundreds of thousands of refugees, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=617.9000000000001s)]
*  millions fleeing into Chad. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=620.86s)]
*  This is not a problem that's solely in Gaza. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  This is worldwide. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=625.5s)]
*  So to say somehow you're not going to give aid to anybody [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=626.86s)]
*  is just cruel. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=630.9399999999999s)]
*  There are people starving to death. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=632.78s)]
*  And the United States always steps up, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=634.54s)]
*  is always the first, and we're always the largest, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=636.9399999999999s)]
*  because that's who we are as Americans. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=639.5s)]
*  So I would challenge Mr. DeSantis on that topic. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=641.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you for taking time out on a very busy day. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=646.5s)]
*  Appreciate the work you do. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=648.78s)]
*  Ambassador Sidney McCain, thank you. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YborCsNNTo&t=649.74s)]
