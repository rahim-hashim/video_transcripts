# Israel’s cabinet votes to approve hostage release deal
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA)
*  CNN is reporting that Israel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=0.0s)]
*  cabinet has approved a deal that [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=1.96s)]
*  would see the release of some [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=4.32s)]
*  hostages from Gaza to or and there [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  you have it the results of that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=8.84s)]
*  hours long meeting there, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=11.28s)]
*  but perhaps an outcome that was expected. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=12.64s)]
*  Absolutely Netanyahu knew he had [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=18.96s)]
*  the support for this and it's not [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=20.48s)]
*  just within his government. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=22.68s)]
*  Certainly there were some some elements [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=24.04s)]
*  that were trying to push against this, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=25.84s)]
*  but not only did they not have [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=27.88s)]
*  the support they also didn't have [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=29.64s)]
*  the votes to take down his government. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  So Netanyahu probably not too worried here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=33.08s)]
*  He also knew based on public opinion polls. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  We have seen that this was what [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=37.4s)]
*  the Israeli public was demanding. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=39.28s)]
*  Even if it wasn't a deal for [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=40.68s)]
*  all of the hostages, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  it was a demand to begin the process [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=43.52s)]
*  of bringing home at least some of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=45.68s)]
*  the hostages. Not a surprise. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Women and children are first. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=48.96s)]
*  They have gotten frankly much of the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  attention and many of the international [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  calls were to release women and children. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  So after hours of debate and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=56.6s)]
*  legal and political process, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=58.36s)]
*  again the smaller war cabinet, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=59.68s)]
*  the security cabinet and then the full cabinet. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=61.76s)]
*  The deal itself has been approved [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=64.0s)]
*  as we've reported. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=65.64s)]
*  I will point out one more thing quickly, John. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=66.6s)]
*  There is now a 24 hour period where [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=68.88s)]
*  anybody who opposes the deal can file [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=70.84s)]
*  at the Supreme Court and try to stop it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=72.84s)]
*  That is part of this process. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=75.16s)]
*  It is largely however a formality. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  The expectation this is going through, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=78.84s)]
*  and we could see some hostages [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=81.64s)]
*  released into Thursday morning, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=83.2s)]
*  perhaps Friday, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=85.16s)]
*  depending on the timeline of all of this, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=86.0s)]
*  and that that too will play out in a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=88.16s)]
*  process about 10 hostages a day over [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=90.36s)]
*  the course of this multi day pause in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=92.36s)]
*  the fighting. What's unclear, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  at least from what I'm seeing right now, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=95.64s)]
*  is when the Palestinian prisoners will [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=97.84s)]
*  be released 150 women and children [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=99.56s)]
*  released from Israeli prisons. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=101.28s)]
*  Alright, Orn Lieberman in Tel Aviv [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=102.56s)]
*  were reporting this in real time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  Will you get back to working your sources? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=105.92s)]
*  Let us know if you hear anything new. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=108.4s)]
*  In the meantime, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=110.72s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister today thanked [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=111.72s)]
*  President Biden for his role in the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  hostage talks we can now call it the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=115.24s)]
*  hostage deal seen as Alex Marquardt [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  is with us more from the effort on that. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  And Alex, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=122.48s)]
*  what are you hearing from your sources [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=123.0s)]
*  now from the White House about this deal? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=125.04s)]
*  The the hostage deal and the prisoner swap. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=127.68s)]
*  John, as Orn was just noting there [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=130.28s)]
*  that we expect Palestinian prisoners [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=132.36s)]
*  to also be released from Israeli prisons. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=134.16s)]
*  I should note I'm also looking at my [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=136.56s)]
*  phone here because another part of what [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  we expect to happen in the coming hours [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=141.24s)]
*  is a statement by Qatar which has been [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=143.8s)]
*  the main mediator in all of this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=146.52s)]
*  They have a very important role as the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=148.84s)]
*  ones who speak directly with Hamas. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=151.44s)]
*  They also engage at the same time [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  with Egypt and the United States. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=155.72s)]
*  The US of course doesn't deal directly [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  with Hamas because they are terrorist [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=160.12s)]
*  organizations so we are expecting. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=162.24s)]
*  A statement to come from Qatar. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=164.28s)]
*  It is a possibility that it comes [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=166.36s)]
*  tomorrow because it is so late in the region. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=168.84s)]
*  But John, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=171.96s)]
*  the US has been central to this process, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  because you have American hostages [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=175.2s)]
*  who are involved, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=177.16s)]
*  some 10 American citizens who are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  missing believed to be hostages. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  A mix of men, women and children. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=182.16s)]
*  One of the most famous cases is someone [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=184.72s)]
*  who was mentioned by President Biden [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  a few days ago after a phone call [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=189.6s)]
*  with the Amir of Qatar Abigail Aidan, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  who is a three year old in Hamas custody. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=195.04s)]
*  She is turning four years old on Friday, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=198.16s)]
*  so this has been so important for [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  the Biden administration because [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=203.12s)]
*  they are so close to those citizens, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  but also because they have unique [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  leverage with with each of these players. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=208.88s)]
*  And the senior most members of the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden administration have been [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  intimately involved with every step [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=214.51999999999998s)]
*  of this process since October 7th. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  We've just seen the top White House [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=217.88s)]
*  official for the Middle East, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=219.92s)]
*  Brett McGurk returned from the Middle [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  East where he was continuing with talks. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=222.92s)]
*  The CIA director Bill Burns has been in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=224.92s)]
*  the region speaking with his Israeli [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=227.16s)]
*  and Qatari counterparts and then the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=228.84s)]
*  president himself has also played a [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=230.84s)]
*  significant role on the phone repeatedly [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=233.16s)]
*  with his counterparts from Israel, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=235.56s)]
*  from Egypt, from Qatar. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=237.96s)]
*  We heard from the White House earlier [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=240.28s)]
*  today saying that that he usually gets [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=242.4s)]
*  updates multiple times a day jumping in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=244.56s)]
*  where he feels appropriate on a personal level. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  So this is going to be something that we [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=249.92s)]
*  expect the US to continue to participate in. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=252.0s)]
*  There we do believe that some American [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=255.92s)]
*  citizens will be among this first [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=257.8s)]
*  release of these 50 hostages. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=259.68s)]
*  Hopefully it will be more in the days after that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=261.52s)]
*  And that this framework, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=265.08s)]
*  these conversations will continue. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=266.4s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu saying two [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=268.2s)]
*  important things today, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=269.96s)]
*  thanking President Biden for getting a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=270.96s)]
*  better deal for the Israeli people, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=273.47999999999996s)]
*  but also saying that the fighting will [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=276.52s)]
*  continue after this pause in the fighting. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=278.56s)]
*  So we do expect those negotiations to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=282.96s)]
*  continue as Orin was just touching on, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  even if say 50 to 70 hostages are [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=288.0s)]
*  released in the coming days, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=290.88s)]
*  the vast majority of those 236 hostages [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=292.52s)]
*  held by Hamas will still be in Gaza, John. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=296.56s)]
*  Alright, Alex Marquardt standby [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=299.88s)]
*  getting a little more information. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=301.88s)]
*  We are hearing that the deal was approved [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=303.24s)]
*  by the Israeli cabinet with a significant [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=305.6s)]
*  majority that is according to a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=307.92s)]
*  government source talking to CNN. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=309.68s)]
*  Let's go now to see it as Becky Anderson [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=312.28s)]
*  in Doha in Qatar where the framework [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=313.96s)]
*  agreement was hammered out Becky at [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  this late hour where you are. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=318.4s)]
*  What are you now hearing? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  Yep, well, we haven't got the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=323.48s)]
*  official announcement from here yet. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=325.92s)]
*  The understanding from here was that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=328.32s)]
*  the Qataris would be putting that [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=331.56s)]
*  announcement out first given that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=333.48s)]
*  they mediated these talks. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  We haven't got that as of yet. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=337.52s)]
*  That's not to suggest that that this [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=340.04s)]
*  deal hasn't now been agreed upon. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  It was a proposal that was delivered [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  to Israel in the early hours of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=347.72s)]
*  yesterday morning. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  The time here now is just after four [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=351.96s)]
*  o'clock in the morning on Wednesday. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=354.16s)]
*  So the Israelis have had this for 24 hours. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=356.56s)]
*  The parameters as we've been discussing [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=360.0s)]
*  is 50 plus women and children over a [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=362.56s)]
*  four to five day period. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=365.44s)]
*  Aid coming in, aid trucks coming in [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=367.36s)]
*  through the border and this pause [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=369.08s)]
*  during which hostilities would cease [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  both on the ground and for periods in the air. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=373.64s)]
*  As I say, nothing further from the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=376.48s)]
*  Qataris who've been mediating these [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=379.24s)]
*  talks for weeks. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=380.88s)]
*  They have been complicated. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=381.64s)]
*  They have been very, very difficult. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=383.6s)]
*  I've spoken to the mediators here on [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=385.44s)]
*  a number of occasions and they have [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=386.88s)]
*  said that they've just been looking [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=388.88s)]
*  over the weeks for a period of calm [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=390.08s)]
*  to get this done. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=392.92s)]
*  But at this stage, that period of calm [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=394.32s)]
*  will only come now that this pause [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=396.96s)]
*  will start. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=401.04s)]
*  That's the news from here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=402.44s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=403.52s)]
*  Becky Anderson, thank you very much [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=404.36s)]
*  for that. 4 a.m. in Qatar. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=406.24s)]
*  The Qataris a central player in working [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=408.76s)]
*  out this deal, which the breaking news [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=411.04s)]
*  is has now been approved by the Israeli [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=412.92s)]
*  cabinet, as many as 50 Israeli hostages [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=417.08s)]
*  expected to be released in the next [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=419.88s)]
*  several days in exchange for 150 [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=421.12s)]
*  Palestinians and a four to five day [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=423.56s)]
*  pause in the fighting. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJfzS5OzHxA&t=426.04s)]
