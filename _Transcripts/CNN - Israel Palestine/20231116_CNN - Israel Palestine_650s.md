# Conditions at Gaza hospital deteriorate amid Israel’s military operation
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M)
*  As Israel attempts to justify its raid of the Al-Shifa hospital, conditions inside the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=0.0s)]
*  complex are growing more dire by the day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=4.96s)]
*  CNN's Nada Bashir has an update on the humanitarian crisis unfolding all across Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  It's a scene that should be filled with innocence. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  But these drawings, sketches of houses, paint a picture of all these children have lost. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Home for the displaced now makeshift shelters in central Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=27.200000000000003s)]
*  Lives in limbo with nowhere to go. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=32.68s)]
*  In the south, as more children are buried. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=36.96s)]
*  Another warning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  Leaflets dropped by the Israeli military on Thursday telling civilians in southern Gaza [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=42.52s)]
*  to move and find shelter. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=47.72s)]
*  A foreboding signal that Israel's ground incursion could soon extend its punishing reach. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=50.48s)]
*  Now they are asking us to leave. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=56.72s)]
*  Where do we go? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=60.64s)]
*  We want to understand where exactly we should go. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=61.64s)]
*  The UN rights experts on Thursday warned that grave violations committed by Israel point, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=68.44s)]
*  in their words, to a genocide in the making. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=74.68s)]
*  As darkness encompasses doctors in the south, already grappling with the impact of Israel's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=78.92s)]
*  intensifying bombing campaign, there are growing fears over what could come next. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=83.84s)]
*  Desperate scenes from the north of Gaza, almost entirely destroyed by Israel's unrelenting [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=90.16s)]
*  airstrikes, show just how dire the situation can quickly become. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  We have lost contact with our colleagues, patients and everyone inside the Al-Shifa [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=101.4s)]
*  medical complex. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=108.04s)]
*  Israeli forces say they are still active in and around the Al-Shifa hospital, Gaza's [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=111.0s)]
*  largest, claiming to have found an operational tunnel shaft at the hospital complex. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=116.28s)]
*  With no access to the complex, CNN is unable to verify either side's claims. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=122.2s)]
*  Israel says its military operation at Al-Shifa will take time, raising fears over the safety [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=128.12s)]
*  and security of more than a thousand patients and medical staff now trapped inside. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  We are looking at options for medical evacuation, but there are a lot of security concerns, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  there are a lot of logistics constraints, our options are rather limited. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=145.8s)]
*  Allegations of people at Al-Shifa being interrogated and even stripped are beginning to emerge. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  While doctors are detailing the harrowing decisions they are being forced to make, including [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=158.68s)]
*  amputating limbs to stop the spread of infection. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  But with the communications blackout cutting northern Gaza off from much of the outside [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=167.24s)]
*  world, CNN has no ability to verify these accounts and has reached out to the IDF for [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=171.56s)]
*  comment. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=178.4s)]
*  No videos have emerged from Starm at Al-Shifa hospital since the raid began in the early [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=179.4s)]
*  hours of Wednesday morning. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=183.96s)]
*  These are some of the last pictures to have been shared with the world. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=188.56s)]
*  Primitve babies in intensive care. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=192.28s)]
*  There is no way to tell if all are still alive. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  Their cries, some of the last sounds heard before the voices of those inside Al-Shifa [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=200.2s)]
*  were silenced. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  Look, there is still mounting concern for the safety and security of those patients [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=209.79999999999998s)]
*  and medical staff as well as other civilians inside the Al-Shifa complex. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  It is extremely difficult to even begin to think about evacuating some of these patients [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  who require specialist medical evacuations. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=225.24s)]
*  As we know already, there are some 1.5 million Palestinians who have been displaced within [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=228.36s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=234.32s)]
*  While there has been an intense focus on the Al-Shifa complex, what we are seeing across [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=235.32s)]
*  the Gaza Strip now is continued aerial bombardment, continued concern over the mounting death [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=239.92s)]
*  toll that we are seeing. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  Wolf? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  Nada Bashir reporting live from Jerusalem. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  Thank you Nada very much. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=249.44s)]
*  Let's get some more on all of these developments. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=250.44s)]
*  Joining us now, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Amnon [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=252.88s)]
*  Scheffler. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=256.96s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=257.96s)]
*  First of all, what more can you tell us about this quote, operational tunnel shaft that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=260.4s)]
*  Israeli forces say they found inside Al-Shifa complex? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=264.96s)]
*  Is that the extent of what the IDF has found at Al-Shifa so far when it comes to tunnels [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  or is there more? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  This is one of the peers that we found in the area that we are continuously also looking [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=278.32s)]
*  for other and this shows that clearly there is a tunnel infrastructure underneath the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=284.20000000000005s)]
*  Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=290.16s)]
*  We found also today a lot of explosives and other ammunition right in that courtyard of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=291.46000000000004s)]
*  the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=297.92s)]
*  Also together with what we found yesterday in the MRI room, we also found the car that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=300.04s)]
*  you just showed that is similar to the cars that were used on the October 7th massacre [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=304.56s)]
*  and it was booby trapped. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=310.8s)]
*  Once again showing how Hamas did not care and was looking forward to explode a car inside [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  the Shifa hospital that would surely have killed also patients and staff of that hospital. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  Dr. Colonel, can you say unequivocally that what's been found at the hospital shows this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=325.24s)]
*  was a major Hamas command center. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=329.96s)]
*  What exactly do you define as a command center? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  Yes, we can say that now clearly and now we're also showing it on top of the evidence that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=335.8s)]
*  we knew from the Intel and that our U.S. counterparts have also verified. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=342.03999999999996s)]
*  What we're seeing here is a place where Hamas can gather. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=346.91999999999996s)]
*  We saw the communication tools that they had. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=352.0s)]
*  We saw the Intel tools that they need in order to facilitate any kind of terrorist activity [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=353.0s)]
*  and carry it out from that infrastructure that they used. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=358.56s)]
*  Again, another civilian infrastructure. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=361.96000000000004s)]
*  Similarly, like they use schools, like they use mosques and also like they use this hospital, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=364.24s)]
*  the Quds hospital, the Rantisi hospital to carry out and plan and execute terrorist activity. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  The director of El Shifa, the hospital there, says patients there are going untreated, including [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=377.40000000000003s)]
*  a lot of children. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=382.16s)]
*  Doesn't Israel have an obligation to deliver critical supplies to at least the patients there? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=383.8s)]
*  We have an obligation, a moral obligation, and we wish to. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  That is why today we brought 4,000 liters of water to the hospital. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=393.92s)]
*  That is why we brought today 1,500 prepared meals to the hospital. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=398.48s)]
*  That is why we're continuously talking to the administration of the hospital and the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=402.72s)]
*  doctors and to see what is needed. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=406.72s)]
*  And based on what they said, we brought in the incubators, we brought in baby food. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=408.56s)]
*  We have designated an area of the hospital, the eastern side of it, that civilians and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  patients that can leave should leave through the humanitarian corridors that we are continuously [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=417.92s)]
*  protecting and allowing those civilians to leave. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=424.06s)]
*  And that is why we're in continuous communication to find the best way that we can alleviate [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=426.52000000000004s)]
*  the suffering that Hamas is bringing on the people in Gaza. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=431.08s)]
*  Are you planning to deliver fuel to the hospital? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=434.82s)]
*  We have offered fuel, 300 liters that our soldiers brought while taking a risk to the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=439.5s)]
*  hospital. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  Sadly, the hospital did not take it in, probably because the Hamas was threatening what would [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=447.09999999999997s)]
*  happen to them if they do. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=453.21999999999997s)]
*  And as I mentioned, we're in continuous communication and whatever the hospital says that they need, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=455.29999999999995s)]
*  we will try to facilitate that. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=459.74s)]
*  The body of an Israeli hostage, a woman, was found near El Shifa Hospital. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=463.02s)]
*  The IDF says she was killed by terrorists. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  Can you explain the exact circumstances of her death? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=470.34000000000003s)]
*  65-year-old grandmother. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=473.94s)]
*  65-year-old Yehudit Weiss was found right next to the El Shifa Hospital and brought [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=478.14s)]
*  to Israel to be buried next to her husband that was also murdered on the 7th of October [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=484.42s)]
*  by Hamas. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=490.26s)]
*  We have two goals in this war that Hamas launched. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=492.1s)]
*  One is to dismantle Hamas, and the second is to bring back the hostages that now on [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=495.64000000000004s)]
*  the day 41 are still being held by Hamas. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=501.02000000000004s)]
*  And I want to remind everyone, the safest and fastest way for these hostages to come [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  home is for Hamas to release them and the international community to continue pressuring [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=509.66s)]
*  Hamas to do so. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=514.5s)]
*  So do you know exactly how this 65-year-old grandmother died? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=516.7s)]
*  We know that she, on October 7th, was alive in her bed in Kibbutz Beiri, and Hamas came [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=523.6600000000001s)]
*  in and brutally massacred 10% of that kibbutz and took her as hostage together with a nine-month-old [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=530.76s)]
*  baby, children, women, and elderly. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=537.82s)]
*  And now we know that she has sadly passed away. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  As you know, Israel has dropped leaflets in the largest city in southern Gaza warning [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=545.7800000000001s)]
*  civilians there to leave. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=550.0400000000001s)]
*  The IDF previously told people to move south for safety. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=551.8000000000001s)]
*  So where are they supposed to go, Lieutenant Colonel? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=555.1800000000001s)]
*  We're the ones that are actually continuously communicating with the people of Gaza, looking [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=559.58s)]
*  for the safer areas where they can be. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=563.98s)]
*  Because we knew that Hamas has its headquarters mainly in the Gaza City, that is where operationally [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=566.42s)]
*  we chose to start. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=571.38s)]
*  But sadly, as we know, Hamas is operating all over the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=573.02s)]
*  More than 10,000 rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israeli civilians, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=577.46s)]
*  and this includes coming from the southern part of Gaza. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=582.98s)]
*  So Hamas is not operating only in Gaza City. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=586.38s)]
*  It's operating also in the south. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=588.86s)]
*  And in order to reach our number one goal, which is to dismantle Hamas, we will go to [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=590.54s)]
*  them wherever they are. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=595.06s)]
*  Yet we are looking for the safest places for the civilians of Gaza. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=596.06s)]
*  And that is why we've asked them initially to move to the southern part of Gaza, south [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=601.8599999999999s)]
*  of the Wadi of Gaza. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=605.42s)]
*  And now we're telling them specifically where to move within that area. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  And also, while doing so, we're continuously in communication with any international organization [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=610.66s)]
*  that wants to aid the Gazans, bring in any international medicine, facilities, food that [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=616.0999999999999s)]
*  can be helped, including field hospitals, that we're inviting any country that wants [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=624.38s)]
*  to donate them to bring them to the southern part of Gaza so we can help the Palestinians. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=628.5s)]
*  As we said, reaching the goal of dismantling Hamas will not only bring it to be safer for [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=633.46s)]
*  Israelis, it will also bring it to be safer for the Palestinians living in Gaza. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=639.46s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Amnon Scheffler, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=643.78s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMrnz6G1j1M&t=649.56s)]
