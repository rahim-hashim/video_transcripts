# Israeli defense minister warns of 'a long war'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg)
*  We're seeing the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken meeting with the Israeli Defense Minister. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's listen to hear if they say anything. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=4.94s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you for coming, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=7.18s)]
*  We always know, knew that the United States is a great ally. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  But today, the people in Israel and in the world see it in their own eyes. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=17.5s)]
*  You are here, second time in this week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=24.54s)]
*  Senior officials of America are here every day. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=28.68s)]
*  And the American flag is on a, is sailing on board in the Mediterranean. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=32.48s)]
*  And we know what is the meaning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=41.64s)]
*  So let me tell you, Mr. Secretary, this will be a long war. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=43.94s)]
*  The price will be high, but we are going to win for Israel, for the Jewish people, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=51.92s)]
*  and for the values that both countries believe in. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  Would you permission, a few words in Hebrew? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=67.0s)]
*  That's the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Galat, who is speaking in Hebrew now after [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=70.0s)]
*  he greeted the U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=91.92s)]
*  They are in Tel Aviv right now where they have been meeting. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=95.0s)]
*  This is Blinken's second time in Israel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=99.24s)]
*  In just a few days, he left Israel and then did this whirlwind diplomatic mission to many [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=102.83999999999999s)]
*  countries in the region. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=108.28s)]
*  But now back in Tel Aviv, Yoav Galat, the Defense Minister, also mentioned the U.S. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=110.25999999999999s)]
*  military presence not far off the coast. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=116.52s)]
*  There is already one carrier group, the USS Gerald Ford, and now a second carrier group, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=118.94s)]
*  Eisenhower will be headed to that region. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=125.52s)]
*  I'm talking here until they start speaking English. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=129.28s)]
*  Let's listen again. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=132.48s)]
*  You know our deep commitment to Israel's right, indeed its obligation, to defend itself and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=133.48s)]
*  to defend its people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=144.44s)]
*  And in that, you have and always have the support of the United States. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=145.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=152.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=153.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=154.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=155.24s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, update on the border? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=156.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=159.24s)]
*  All business from the U.S. Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, meeting with the Israeli [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=160.24s)]
*  Defense Minister, Yoav Galat, did not take questions, did not say much of anything other [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=164.12s)]
*  than the U.S. is firmly behind Israel as it prepares, seemingly, for a ground operation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  into Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=176.44s)]
*  Let's get straight to Israel where CNN's Nick Robertson is. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=177.44s)]
*  Nick, what is the latest on the ground at this hour? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=182.04s)]
*  It's been a relatively quiet day in terms of rocket strikes, missiles, artillery going [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=186.88s)]
*  into Gaza, and not many missiles coming out of Gaza either. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=193.11999999999998s)]
*  It creates the impression that there's not a pause, but at least a diminution in the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=198.16s)]
*  amount of military activity to perhaps give some space to some of the political discussions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=203.76s)]
*  I said that, and you heard the explosion behind me. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=210.4s)]
*  Yes, the afternoon has become increasingly punctuated by heavy explosions. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  That does sound like a missile strike landing on Gaza there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=218.36s)]
*  And perhaps as we go into darkness, I think we're beginning to see perhaps a little up [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=223.76000000000002s)]
*  pick in the tempo here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  This is northern Gaza right behind me there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=230.0s)]
*  We know that in northern Gaza late today, the IDF said that they hit a Hamas commander [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=232.74s)]
*  appearing to destroy a building, taking him out, if you will. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=238.44s)]
*  And along this border area, we're seeing that continued buildup and preparations among the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=243.4s)]
*  IDF in readiness for the possibility of a ground incursion. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=249.08s)]
*  Now, I don't know how this may affect the military operations, but there was a very, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=252.96s)]
*  very heavy rainstorm passed through here earlier today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  But from a UN and humanitarian perspective, inside Gaza, rainstorms are the last thing [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=261.48s)]
*  they need. Half a million people understood to have left northern Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  There isn't enough shelter for them in the south of Gaza. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=272.0s)]
*  There isn't enough food, isn't enough water. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=275.08s)]
*  So real concerns. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=277.6s)]
*  If the weather does deteriorate more and there's more rainstorms, a lot of civilians [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=279.08s)]
*  inside Gaza not only trying to dodge missiles, but will also be caught out in some atrocious [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=284.72s)]
*  conditions. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=290.12s)]
*  Just an absolutely terrible situation. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  And of course, as soon as you say that it's been quiet, we heard the airstrikes behind [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=294.32s)]
*  you as darkness has fallen where you are on the border, near the border between Israel [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=298.55999999999995s)]
*  and Gaza. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=303.96s)]
*  Thank you so much for that report, Nick. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  And I want to now go to Jerusalem and CNN's Jeremy Diamond. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=306.59999999999997s)]
*  Jeremy, I know you have been following and doing reporting on what the Secretary of State, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=310.23999999999995s)]
*  Antony Blinken, has been doing, not just in Israel, where you are. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=314.96s)]
*  He is now back, but also the frantic shuttle diplomacy he has been engaged in across the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=319.16s)]
*  region. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=325.36s)]
*  Yeah, then between Secretary of State Tony Blinken's visit to Israel last week and his [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=328.20000000000005s)]
*  visit today, he visited about a half dozen Arab countries in the region, countries ranging [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=332.16s)]
*  from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, et cetera. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  And all of this in a shuttle diplomacy effort focused on several key lines, the first of [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=343.28000000000003s)]
*  which is the humanitarian situation inside of Gaza, trying to get the flow of aid back [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=349.04s)]
*  into Gaza, as well as allowing Americans to be able to leave through the Ra'afah crossing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=355.08s)]
*  and go into Egypt. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=362.16s)]
*  In addition to that, the Secretary of State also focused on trying to prevent this Hamas-Israel [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=365.2s)]
*  conflict from blowing up into a wider war. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=370.0s)]
*  And then, of course, there is the issue of those 199 hostages being held inside of Gaza, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=373.4s)]
*  of which at least 20 of whom are believed to be American citizens. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=378.64s)]
*  Now, we know that the Secretary of State today met with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=382.24s)]
*  Netanyahu, as well as the Israeli president and the defense minister. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=386.36s)]
*  We just saw the Secretary of State with the defense minister, where Blinken effectively [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=390.52s)]
*  reiterated the U.S.'s commitment to the state of Israel to its right and what he said is [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=395.4s)]
*  also its obligation to defend itself. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=400.0s)]
*  But one thing became very clear in this visit today is that while Blinken is trying to address [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=402.36s)]
*  the humanitarian situation, trying to prevent this war from becoming a regional situation, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  he is not there to prevent war from growing bigger between Israel and Hamas. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=413.36s)]
*  And that was evidenced when you heard the Israeli defense minister, Gallant, saying [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=419.24s)]
*  that this will be a long war and also warning that the price for Israel to defend itself [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=423.52s)]
*  will indeed be high. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=428.91999999999996s)]
*  There is no sign as of yet that the U.S. is backing off from this kind of no-daylight [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=431.32s)]
*  position with Israel. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=435.64s)]
*  They are fully supporting Israel in its plans to widen this military campaign against Hamas. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=436.88s)]
*  What they are trying to do is to get Americans out of the Gaza Strip, to get humanitarian [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=443.32s)]
*  aid into the Gaza Strip, and also ideally to try and find some way of getting those [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=447.71999999999997s)]
*  American hostages who are in Gaza out of their and out of harm's way. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=453.0s)]
*  Dana? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=457.6s)]
*  Jeremy, thank you so much for that reporting. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=458.6s)]
*  And today, a site the world has been waiting to see. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  CNN spotted five U.N. fuel trucks enter Gaza. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=465.28s)]
*  It is the first sign that the Rafa crossing, the one between Gaza and Egypt, is even partially [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  open. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  But this is important. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=476.2s)]
*  It remains closed to people, desperate Palestinian civilians trapped in a war zone. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=477.2s)]
*  The Egyptians, they have to be willing to have that gate open and have a flow of human [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=485.32s)]
*  traffic through that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=489.71999999999997s)]
*  And so we're in discussions with them about what that could look like and how that could [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=491.8s)]
*  be managed in a way that protects Egypt's national security interests as well. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5H3HFGlGcg&t=495.52000000000004s)]
