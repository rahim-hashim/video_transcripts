# Netanyahu unveils plan for Gaza’s future post-Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8)
*  The Palestinian Authority is lashing out Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for Gaza's post-war [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=0.0s)]
*  future, calling it a plan for the reoccupation of Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=5.92s)]
*  This after the Israeli prime minister unveiled a day-after plan to members of the Security [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=10.08s)]
*  Cabinet Thursday night. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=14.58s)]
*  It includes the complete demilitarization of the enclave, closing off Gaza's southern [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=16.04s)]
*  border with Egypt, as well as the overhaul of Gaza's civil administration and education [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=21.6s)]
*  systems. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=26.72s)]
*  Israel joins talks in Paris aimed at a ceasefire in its war with Hamas and a potential release [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=28.2s)]
*  of hostages as well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=33.28s)]
*  There's a growing sense of urgency to find an agreement here after Israel threaten to [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=34.68s)]
*  expand its assault in Gaza's southernmost city, Rafa, if hostages are not released by [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=39.4s)]
*  the start of Ramadan in about two weeks from now. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=44.92s)]
*  CNN's Nick Robertson is in Tel Aviv for us with the latest. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=48.0s)]
*  So let's just talk about this plan, Nick. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  Just give us more detail in terms of what is in this plan and how the U.S. will likely [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=54.08s)]
*  respond to certain parts of this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=67.2s)]
*  Yeah, we've actually already heard from Secretary of State Antony Blinken referring to a couple [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=70.0s)]
*  of parts of it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=76.24s)]
*  He said he'd just seen reports about it and he'd yet to get into the detail of it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=77.24s)]
*  One of the things that stands out in this proposal by Prime Minister Netanyahu is the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  full control of Gaza, all the borders, which means taking control of the southern border [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=89.02s)]
*  along what is now the border between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=95.38s)]
*  And he says that is to stop any smuggling underground using tunnels or overgrounds. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=99.26s)]
*  That would be a significant change and could well be contested. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=105.62s)]
*  Of course, that thing alone, and there are other issues as well, but just that one point [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=110.02000000000001s)]
*  alone brings into question the idea of a Palestinian statehood if it can't control its borders. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=117.34s)]
*  But of course, another point that Prime Minister Netanyahu put in his plan is that there will [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  be no independent, or Israel will certainly not recognize any independent recognition [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=131.46s)]
*  of a Palestinian state. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=136.66s)]
*  And that's a message to the United States. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=138.78s)]
*  One of the other points, and this is one of the points that Secretary Blinken picked up [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  upon, is that in the plan there will be, according to Prime Minister Netanyahu, a border area [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  inside Gaza giving security for Israel outside of Gaza for as long as is deemed necessary. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=156.26000000000002s)]
*  And that is something that the United States had previously opposed specifically. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=164.42s)]
*  So that also seems to sort of fly in the face of what Israel's allies are saying. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=170.14s)]
*  Another point that's raised as well is Israel passing over or giving some sort of civilian [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=177.38s)]
*  control to unnamed, unspecified civilian bodies or persons. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  But also it talks about de-radicalizing inside schools, inside welfare institutions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=191.06s)]
*  Again, that does not really sound like an independent Palestinian state. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  In fact, this is, I think, the point that the Palestinian Authority are making, that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=208.34s)]
*  This is really a reoccupation by Israel, although Israel is saying it will completely demilitarize [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=215.70000000000002s)]
*  the whole area, but it clearly wants to be able to have operational ability inside the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=224.3s)]
*  freedom of operational movement for security measures. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  So this is what the Palestinian Authority is talking about. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=235.62s)]
*  So this is, it appears, a very maximalist plan that's been put forward by the Prime [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=238.18s)]
*  Minister. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=242.94000000000003s)]
*  This is not set in stone. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=244.18s)]
*  It's something that will be discussed. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=245.5s)]
*  But I think it indicates even to allies like the United States that Israel's position on [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=247.9s)]
*  Gaza is really as strong and as hard as it has ever been. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=255.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, a lot of people will look at this plan and see it as a reoccupation of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=260.46000000000004s)]
*  Gaza or at the very least preventing any kind of Palestinian sovereignty, at least in the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=265.42s)]
*  short term. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=270.3s)]
*  What kind of regional reaction are we getting? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=271.42s)]
*  So far, we've yet to hear from some of the regional partners, in particular Qatar, that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=278.1s)]
*  is the interlocutor at the moment between Israel and Hamas to get the hostages released [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=285.74s)]
*  and the language that's been put forward, although it doesn't specify Qatar by name. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=290.38s)]
*  The language seems to imply that Qatar would not be part of the plan going forward for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=296.58000000000004s)]
*  having an involvement as it has had until now, essentially helping finance through Israel [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=303.74s)]
*  and the United States the authorities inside Gaza. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=313.06s)]
*  That appears to be ruled out. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=318.5s)]
*  Israel is saying that the Arab partners that it would have to help administer and finance [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=320.7s)]
*  what happens inside Gaza would be of its choosing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=326.94s)]
*  And the indication is that Qatar not named, but would not be one of them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=330.86s)]
*  So how they'll respond isn't clear. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=335.46s)]
*  Obviously, the plan to control the southern border is going to affect Egypt. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=338.7s)]
*  We haven't heard them yet reply specifically to this, but it will have potentially territorial [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=343.34000000000003s)]
*  implications for them and other implications as well. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=350.06s)]
*  And we know that right now the Egyptians are building a buffer zone, an additional security [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=353.18s)]
*  zone along that southern border, potentially in preparation for those Palestinians who [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=358.22s)]
*  are stuck in Ra'afah if they try to get over the fence and escape out of Gaza if there's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=365.74s)]
*  an Israeli ground incursion. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=370.78s)]
*  But this could also be potentially because Israel is going to take control of that border. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=372.66s)]
*  Nick Robertson, live for us there. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=383.02000000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=384.70000000000005s)]
*  Israel is rejecting disturbing allegations reported by UN experts of its forces killing, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=386.18s)]
*  imprisoning and raping Palestinian women and girls, saying the allegations are motivated [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=392.26000000000005s)]
*  by hatred for Israel. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=397.1s)]
*  Earlier this week, UN experts said they were distressed by reports of multiple forms of [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=399.14s)]
*  sexual assault against Palestinian women and girls in detention, including being stripped [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=404.29999999999995s)]
*  naked and searched by male Israeli army officers. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=408.94s)]
*  Those UN experts are calling for an independent investigation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=412.53999999999996s)]
*  And the unique toll on women in this conflict cannot be ignored. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=415.94s)]
*  Statistics from the UN show that around 70% of those killed in Gaza are estimated to be [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  women and children and that two mothers are killed every hour. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=426.22s)]
*  Earlier, my colleague Becky Anderson spoke to the UN special rapporteur on violence against [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=431.26000000000005s)]
*  women and girls about these allegations. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=435.82000000000005s)]
*  Reem El-Salam said that some of these allegations are not new. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=437.78000000000003s)]
*  I want you to listen to what was said. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  We must remember that these reports of sexual violence, especially I would say committed [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=444.90000000000003s)]
*  against Palestinian women, is one of many egregious human rights and humanitarian law [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=450.94000000000005s)]
*  violations that Palestinian women are being subjected to, including an unfolding genocide, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=455.54s)]
*  occupation for decades, arbitrary killing, forced starvation, the use of reproductive [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=461.38s)]
*  violence in particular as a tool of war against them. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=466.98s)]
*  And I would say that these allegations that we've heard also are not new. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=470.7s)]
*  They've been pointed out by human rights organizations on the ground. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  My colleague, the special rapporteur on the occupied territories in our last report also [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=478.34s)]
*  pointed out that there have been longstanding reports of the ill treatment and torture [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=483.14s)]
*  that Palestinian women and sexual assault that they have faced in Israeli detention. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=488.66s)]
*  So we are not talking about something that has just emerged after October 7th. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=493.54s)]
*  UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem El-Salam speaking to CNN earlier. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bk68dV3rB8&t=499.7s)]
