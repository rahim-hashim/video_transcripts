# Israeli whistleblowers detail abuse of Palestinians in shadowy detention center
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [May 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY)
*  It's a place the Israeli military doesn't want us to see. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=0.0s)]
*  How many Palestinians are in there, right? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=7.0s)]
*  Who are you? Give me a business now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=10.0s)]
*  Hang on, what is it that you want? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=13.0s)]
*  Put it on my card. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=15.0s)]
*  But CNN has gained exclusive evidence of Palestinian prisoner abuse [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=17.0s)]
*  from multiple Israeli whistleblowers. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=23.0s)]
*  At the Sedit Amman facility in southern Israel, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=30.0s)]
*  we joined human rights activists amid growing public concern [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=36.0s)]
*  for the detainees being held inside. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=40.0s)]
*  This is a protest by Israeli citizens outside a detention centre close to Gaza, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=43.0s)]
*  where we know hundreds of Palestinians have been held. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=50.0s)]
*  You can see it's a closed military facility. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=53.0s)]
*  It's behind a barbed wire fence. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=56.0s)]
*  The barbed wire fence was not permitted access. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=58.0s)]
*  And there's hostility from passers-by. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=61.0s)]
*  We just had somebody drive past in a car and they shouted out to us in Hebrew, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=64.0s)]
*  you're defending murderers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=68.0s)]
*  We're defending basic human rights. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=70.0s)]
*  And eyewitnesses are now speaking out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=73.0s)]
*  Away from the military facility near the beaches of Tel Aviv, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=78.0s)]
*  one young Israeli army reservist agreed to speak [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=82.0s)]
*  to the detainees at Sedit Amman. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=86.0s)]
*  He says they're kept in cages or pens, constantly shackled and blindfolded, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=89.0s)]
*  many for weeks on end. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=94.0s)]
*  We've hidden his identity and voice to shield him from prosecution. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=96.0s)]
*  We were told they are not allowed to move and must sit upright. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=100.0s)]
*  They're not allowed to talk or peek under their blindfolds. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=103.0s)]
*  And what happened if they did do that? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=106.0s)]
*  What kind of punishments would be to that? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=109.0s)]
*  We were allowed to pick out problematic people and punish them, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=111.0s)]
*  and they would stand with their hands above their heads for an unlimited time. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=114.0s)]
*  If they didn't keep their hands up, we could zip tie them to the fence. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=117.0s)]
*  The Israeli military says detainees are handcuffed [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=121.0s)]
*  based on their risk level and health status. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=124.0s)]
*  But the account tallies with photographic evidence, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=127.0s)]
*  obtained by CNN, of Palestinian detainees inside Sedit Amman. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=130.0s)]
*  And with hand and wrist injuries, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=136.0s)]
*  shown to CNN by dozens of Palestinians, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=139.0s)]
*  released back into Gaza. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=142.0s)]
*  I was zip tied and blindfolded, says this former detainee, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=145.0s)]
*  and tortured in a way I never imagined. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=149.0s)]
*  One source telling us the restraints were so tight, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=152.0s)]
*  they had to amputate a man's hand. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=155.0s)]
*  The view that I've heard expressed is that, you know, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=158.0s)]
*  how do you think Israeli hostages are treated by Hamas? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=161.0s)]
*  This sentiment was voiced in the facility, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=164.0s)]
*  but I think that if Hamas is so abominable, which I agree with, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=166.0s)]
*  then why use Hamas as a bar? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=169.0s)]
*  It's a descent into dehumanization. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=172.0s)]
*  A descent that's accelerated [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=175.0s)]
*  since the rampage by Hamas on October 7th last year. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=179.0s)]
*  The killing and abduction to Gaza of hundreds of Israelis [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=184.0s)]
*  provoked outrage and a brutal response. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=187.0s)]
*  Mid-Israel's wrath, tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=192.0s)]
*  and thousands detained for interrogation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=200.0s)]
*  Transported to facilities like Sedit Amman, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=204.0s)]
*  where one Israeli guard now tells CNN prisoners are routinely beaten. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=207.0s)]
*  We've hidden his identity and voice too. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=213.0s)]
*  You can take them out and hit them maybe four or five times with a club. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=216.0s)]
*  It's not dying in the face so you don't see blood. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=221.0s)]
*  The detainees lie belly down, being hit and kicked, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=224.0s)]
*  people screaming and dogs barking at them. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=227.0s)]
*  It's terrifying. Some detainees are taken away and beaten really hard, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=230.0s)]
*  so bones and teeth are broken. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=234.0s)]
*  So you saw people who were subject to these beatings, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=236.0s)]
*  who had their bones broken and who had their teeth broken. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=240.0s)]
*  Yes, it's a practice which commanders know about. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=244.0s)]
*  They want intelligence, but they also want revenge and punishment [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=247.0s)]
*  for what happened on October 7. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=250.0s)]
*  The Israeli military hasn't approved CNN's requests for access to Sedit Amman. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=253.0s)]
*  At the gates of the facility, we challenged the Israeli guards. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=259.0s)]
*  How many Palestinians are in there right now? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=264.0s)]
*  I don't know. Do you know if they're handcuffed or if they're being blindfolded? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=267.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=273.0s)]
*  This is a facility. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=275.0s)]
*  As we leave, masked soldiers approach. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=277.0s)]
*  Hello. How are you? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=280.0s)]
*  Are you filming this place? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=282.0s)]
*  We're leaving the army. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=285.0s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=288.0s)]
*  I don't see you there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=290.0s)]
*  Give me a place, please. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=292.0s)]
*  They try to take our cameras. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=294.0s)]
*  Give me a place now. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=296.0s)]
*  What is it that you want? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=298.0s)]
*  My camera or my card? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=300.0s)]
*  You then order us to leave. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=302.0s)]
*  Well, we're driving now to meet one Israeli with personal experience [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=308.0s)]
*  of the Sudey Taman facility. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=313.0s)]
*  It's experience that he says has left him shocked at the condition [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=316.0s)]
*  and the medical treatment of Palestinian detainees there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=321.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=325.0s)]
*  He told us he treated Palestinian detainees with gunshot wounds [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=327.0s)]
*  fresh from the war zone in Gaza, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=331.0s)]
*  but was appalled at the lack of equipment and expertise. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=333.0s)]
*  The problem is, Gazans who are brought in are labelled as terrorists [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=337.0s)]
*  and it is very popular opinion over here that terrorists deserve to die, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=341.0s)]
*  so they do not deserve the same medical care as everyone else. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=345.0s)]
*  Satellite imagery obtained by CNN shows how the Sedey Taman facility [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=349.0s)]
*  was expanded after the October 7 attacks, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=354.0s)]
*  with detention facilities and makeshift medical bays being added [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=358.0s)]
*  after public hospitals in Israel refused to treat injured Gazan suspects. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=362.0s)]
*  Eyewitness accounts describe a field hospital with 15 to 20 patients [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=369.0s)]
*  virtually naked and blindfolded, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=374.0s)]
*  with hands and feet shackled to their beds and wearing diapers. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=377.0s)]
*  One eyewitness told CNN painful procedures were carried out [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=381.0s)]
*  by under-qualified medics. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=385.0s)]
*  The treatment the medical worker told us amounts to punishment. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=388.0s)]
*  In my view, it's the idea of total vulnerability. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=392.0s)]
*  If you imagine being unable to move, being unable to see what's going on, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=395.0s)]
*  that's something that borders, if not crosses, into psychological torture. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=400.0s)]
*  The Israeli military says prisoners are stripped for security checks [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=405.0s)]
*  and that investigations are opened when there's suspicion of misconduct. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=410.0s)]
*  Still, the counts from Israelis and Palestinians inside [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=415.0s)]
*  and the shocking images paint a disturbing picture. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh83jIwZjyY&t=419.0s)]
