# Their loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas. Hear their message to Biden
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0)
*  The Israeli military is assessing claims made by Hamas that the youngest hostage, 10-month-old [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=0.0s)]
*  Kfir Bivas and his mom, were killed. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=9.32s)]
*  Hamas is claiming that they were killed by an Israeli airstrike. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=13.88s)]
*  Obviously whoever kidnaps a baby and a mom, they're responsible for what happens to them, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=18.04s)]
*  regardless of how they were killed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=25.16s)]
*  I'm wondering if any of you want to comment on this awful news. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=27.68s)]
*  Again, we don't know if it's even true, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=32.2s)]
*  I think the family came out with a statement saying that they are looking at the facts [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=35.88s)]
*  and hoping for good news, but that's part of the psychological warfare that Hamas is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=40.32s)]
*  doing. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=46.88s)]
*  And going back to Liz's comment about the international red cross, they need to be the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=47.88s)]
*  witness. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=53.400000000000006s)]
*  They are the conscience of the international community and need to speak up and be vocal [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=54.56s)]
*  about what they are seeing and calling them out for these types of acts that they are doing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  The whole world needs to speak up. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  We don't feel that the international community is appalled the way they should be. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=70.64s)]
*  It's a humanitarian crisis at the highest level and there don't seem to be enough outrage [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  out there. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=83.28s)]
*  Now, over 30 different nationalities being held hostage today. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  And I think we've seen the success with the release of some hostages over the past several [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=88.4s)]
*  days and the US government, Israel, Egypt, Qatar are working together and I'm really [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=94.68s)]
*  grateful for that. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=102.08s)]
*  That's how my Aunt Aviva, how Abigail have been released, but there's so many other hostages [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=103.36s)]
*  who have not yet been released and time is of the essence. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=111.16s)]
*  Do any of you think that President Biden is not doing enough? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  That he needs to be doing more? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=119.52s)]
*  It's okay if you feel that way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=122.36s)]
*  If I had a loved one in captivity, I probably would think that nobody's doing enough. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=123.4s)]
*  We have heard President Biden expressing the hostages as top priority, but we're still [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=130.68s)]
*  sitting here 54 days later with eight of us, eight families still waiting for the loved [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=137.72s)]
*  ones. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=145.0s)]
*  I think Biden and his administration, they do more than enough since the first day. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=146.0s)]
*  But the math shouldn't fool us, which means if every day 10 people being released, it [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=154.72s)]
*  doesn't mean necessarily that the two weeks from now, the remaining 140 something hostages [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=161.76s)]
*  will be out. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=167.8s)]
*  So that's the main concern. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=169.6s)]
*  You talked about how you don't think that you're getting enough support from the world [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=171.74s)]
*  and I'm sure you know that one of the reasons that is, and there are probably many reasons, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=176.2s)]
*  but one of the reasons that is, is because many people in the world think that the IDF's [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=180.72s)]
*  response has killed too many innocent Palestinians. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=185.28s)]
*  The IDF says they're going after Hamas and Hamas embeds with the population and they're [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=190.84s)]
*  not trying to kill civilians, but Hamas goes where the population is. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=197.64000000000001s)]
*  That's the reason. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=203.76s)]
*  Do you think that the IDF should be focusing more, not just the IDF, that Netanyahu should [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  be focusing more on the hostages, getting them out, saving them, and the time for going [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=209.4s)]
*  after Hamas should come later? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=215.58s)]
*  At the beginning of the conflict, I think the Israeli government was more focused on [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=218.8s)]
*  going after Hamas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  I think the fact that the families have come together, we each feel collectively that we [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=227.44s)]
*  have 240 new family members. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=234.16s)]
*  And I think the success of the families being together and being able to unite around the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=237.96s)]
*  hostages issue and getting the people of Israel behind us has changed the perception [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=244.3s)]
*  of the government of Israel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=252.82000000000002s)]
*  The hostages have been 54 days, somewhere in the dark in Gaza. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=254.74s)]
*  It is an immediate need. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=260.3s)]
*  The immediacy of getting these hostages out, a young man like Hirsch, who had his arm blown [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=262.98s)]
*  off, he doesn't have days to wait. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=267.42s)]
*  Little people, big people, mothers, brothers, young women who we know are not being treated [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=271.92s)]
*  well in Gaza, they need to get out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=278.68s)]
*  When we talk about it, none of us are talking about this politically. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=282.36s)]
*  We're talking about it as a human crisis. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=285.24s)]
*  For me, the issue of how do we finish with the work of Hamas and getting rid of them, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  let's put it aside for a second. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=297.88s)]
*  Let's just focus on getting these 150 folks, people, our family, our relatives, out and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=299.64s)]
*  getting them safe. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=306.96s)]
*  That should be everyone's priority right now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=308.84s)]
*  All I can say is I hope that your loved ones get home soon. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=310.8s)]
*  And I know for the ones of you that have men being held hostage who are not top priority, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=314.8s)]
*  because women and children and older people are being prioritized. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=322.2s)]
*  And people in the IDF, they will be last on the list. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=327.44s)]
*  And I'm so sorry for that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=332.4s)]
*  It's time to change this equation, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=334.68s)]
*  Who said that? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=337.16s)]
*  You know, where is it coming from? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=338.16s)]
*  We believe collectively that anybody from any group should be released. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=341.16s)]
*  There should be a mixed group from now on. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=346.2s)]
*  Yes, we 100% agree that children, being the sensitive souls that they are, should have [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=349.2s)]
*  been released first. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=354.88s)]
*  But from now on, there should be a consideration of men and women, old and young, soldiers [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=356.36s)]
*  and civilians. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=364.44s)]
*  They all should come out. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=365.44s)]
*  They're all the same. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=366.44s)]
*  There should be representation of each and every group coming out. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=367.44s)]
*  What do you want anybody watching right now to know about your loved one? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=372.0s)]
*  What should somebody who's watched this and is sitting at home afterwards, what should [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=378.64s)]
*  they know about him? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  Idan is an American kid. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=385.20000000000005s)]

*  He's a real foodie. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=398.72s)]
*  Like, he knows all the restaurants. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=399.72s)]
*  Like, we've been in concert everywhere. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=402.16s)]
*  Like, he's amazing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=404.68s)]
*  He doesn't belong there. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't belong there. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  He belongs with us, with the family. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=410.96000000000004s)]
*  As simple as that. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=411.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=412.96000000000004s)]
*  What do you want people to know about Omer? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=413.96s)]
*  Omer is a kind person that when he comes to the room, he just captures everybody's attention [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=416.96s)]
*  just because of his sheer size and kindness. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=423.2s)]
*  He loves playing basketball and admires the NBA and the NFL. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=429.64s)]

*  What do you want us to know about Itai? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=438.08s)]
*  He's a very talented kid. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=439.96s)]
*  He sings. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=441.84s)]
*  He dances. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=442.84s)]
*  He's been in the life of the party. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=444.71999999999997s)]
*  He has been in the Boy Scouts until the age of 18, so he mentored his young kids. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  And maybe the most important part, he and his older brother play NBA 2K. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=452.32s)]
*  So I get my ass whooped by my eldest son, so he needs his younger brother to come back [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  so he could go back and play with him NBA 2K. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  Emily, tell us about your uncle, Keith. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=469.79999999999995s)]

*  My uncle Keith is a really gentle, kind father and grandfather. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=474.12s)]

*  I want them all home soon. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for talking to us. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT9w72pUJS0&t=497.56s)]
