# Netanyahu shares 3 things to understand about the war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI)
*  And let's start with what's happening at that hospital. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli forces have said that they are engaged [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=2.88s)]
*  in intense fighting around Al-Shifa Hospital, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=5.28s)]
*  the largest medical facility in Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=8.08s)]
*  I know that you say that the hospital sits on top [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  of a Hamas command and control center, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=13.68s)]
*  but of course there are also patients, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=16.28s)]
*  civilians sheltering in that complex getting treatment. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=17.88s)]
*  So how do you intend to go after Hamas [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=21.36s)]
*  without putting sick and injured civilians in that hospital [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=23.88s)]
*  at more risk than they already are? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=27.44s)]
*  Well, we've called to evacuate all the patients [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=30.96s)]
*  from that hospital. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=33.24s)]
*  And in fact, 100 or so have already been evacuated. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=34.2s)]
*  I've called for field hospitals. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  The French president has sent a floating hospital ship. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=39.08s)]
*  I've asked the Emirates to send a field hospital. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=41.8s)]
*  They have. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=45.0s)]
*  And other countries have done the same. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  I expect the UN to build this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  So there's no reason why we just can't take the patients out [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=49.16s)]
*  of there instead of letting Hamas use it as a command [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=52.2s)]
*  center for terrorism, for the rockets [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  that they fire against Israel, for the terror tunnels [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=57.92s)]
*  that they use to kill Israeli civilians. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  Remember, let's keep this in focus. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  Just imagine what would happen if the United States [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=65.08s)]
*  were attacked viciously by 29-11s, 20. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=68.18s)]
*  That's the proportionate number. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=73.06s)]
*  50,000 American killed, 10,000 Americans held hostage, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=74.6s)]
*  including babies, elderly, women, children, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  10,000 rockets falling on your cities. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  That's the number of rockets that are falling all the time [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=85.12s)]
*  on our cities may fall during this interview, in fact, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=87.6s)]
*  and we'll have to go to a shelter. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  So what would America do? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=92.64s)]
*  It would take all its force and go after these killers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=94.52s)]
*  And what if these killers embed themselves in hospitals, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=98.0s)]
*  in schools, in UN facilities? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  You do everything in your power to get the civilians out, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=102.33999999999999s)]
*  which is what we're doing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=105.96s)]
*  We call them to leave, but you certainly wouldn't give [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=107.32s)]
*  immunity to the terrorists. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=109.84s)]
*  So we're obviously treading carefully [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=110.96s)]
*  when it comes to hospitals, but we're also not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=113.36s)]
*  going to give immunity to the terrorists. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=115.8s)]
*  And so far, even though Hamas has tried to prevent [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=117.3s)]
*  the civilians from leaving, hundreds of thousands [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=120.58s)]
*  have left, sometimes having to go through Hamas gun points [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=123.5s)]
*  and gunfire that wants to keep them in harm's way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=127.46s)]
*  Just to be clear, sir, Israel will aid, help these civilians [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=130.54s)]
*  who are quite sick and inside these hospitals come out, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=135.46s)]
*  not just in Al-Shifa, but there are other hospitals [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=139.06s)]
*  where this has happened. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=142.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=143.1s)]
*  Yes, we're telling them to leave. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=144.42s)]
*  Telling them or helping them? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=145.78s)]
*  Helping them by creating safe corridors. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  So we have designated routes to a safe zone [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=150.74s)]
*  south of Gaza City where there's no fighting. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=154.1s)]
*  And we're telling them, go ahead, move. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=157.18s)]
*  And by the way, 70,000 have moved three days ago. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=158.62s)]
*  I think 50,000 moved yesterday. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  More will move today. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  We want all the civilians to be removed out of harm's way. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  And Hamas is doing everything in their power [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=168.82s)]
*  to keep them in harm's way. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=171.26s)]
*  Do you believe? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  They put missiles below, yes, go ahead. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=173.38s)]
*  Do you believe that there are hostages [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=175.52s)]
*  below that hospital, Israeli or American hostages? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=178.72s)]
*  Well, I'm not gonna go into the intelligence picture [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=184.12s)]
*  we have, but you know, there's been this vicious thing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  They take hostages. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  Imagine a baby is held hostage. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=192.96s)]
*  Who takes a baby hostage? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=195.52s)]
*  I don't know if you have children, Dan. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure your camera crew has, and we all have children. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=198.72s)]
*  What is this taking children hostages? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=201.88s)]
*  Threatening to kill them. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=204.76s)]
*  I mean, this is savagery of the highest order. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=206.28s)]
*  So obviously we're doing everything in our power [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=208.8s)]
*  to achieve two things. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=211.2s)]
*  One, destroy Hamas, because without it, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=212.2s)]
*  none of us have a future. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=214.48s)]
*  And it's not only our war, it's your war too. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=216.16s)]
*  It's the battle of civilization against barbarism. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=218.36s)]
*  And if we don't win here, this scourge will pass. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=221.12s)]
*  The Middle East will pass to other places. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=223.96s)]
*  Middle East will fall, Europe is next, you'll be next. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=226.24s)]
*  But the first goal is to destroy Hamas. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=228.96s)]
*  And the second goal is to bring back our hostages. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=232.72s)]
*  We're trying to do both. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=235.2s)]
*  Yeah, so those are completely understandable goals. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=236.16s)]
*  Goals that the United States very much supports. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=239.16s)]
*  Understanding that Hamas is a barbaric terrorist organization. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=243.36s)]
*  But Israel is not Hamas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=248.12s)]
*  And the United States also makes very clear [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=250.36s)]
*  that democracies have to do better. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=253.0s)]
*  The Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=255.88s)]
*  said that far too many Palestinian civilians [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=258.56s)]
*  have been killed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  What is your response to that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=262.92s)]
*  I think any civilian loss is a tragedy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=265.56s)]
*  And the blame should be placed squarely on Hamas, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=269.0s)]
*  because it prevents them from leaving the war zone. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=271.48s)]
*  Sometimes at gunpoint, it's fired on the safe zone [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  and the safe corridor that we enacted. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=277.04s)]
*  The other day, to prevent Palestinians [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=280.0s)]
*  from leaving harm's way, it puts rockets inside schools, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=281.92s)]
*  hospitals. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  It has tunnels below children's beds. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=286.76s)]
*  This is what we're dealing with. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=290.8s)]
*  So obviously, we can't give them immunity. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=291.36s)]
*  But because Israel isn't Hamas, is Israel [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=292.96s)]
*  doing everything possible to take that into consideration [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  and avoid civilian deaths? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, more than that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=301.36s)]
*  And more than that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=302.8s)]
*  We're trying to minimize civilian casualties. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=303.64s)]
*  As a result of our ground action, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=306.24s)]
*  I think the number of civilian casualties [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=307.68s)]
*  is actually being reduced, because people [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=310.0s)]
*  are heeding our calls to leave the area [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=311.96000000000004s)]
*  and defying Hamas's attempt to keep them there. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=314.8s)]
*  And we'll do everything in our power to do that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=317.84s)]
*  But the one example I could give you is this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=319.76s)]
*  Look, these savages, they perpetrated the worst horrors [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=321.96s)]
*  on Jews since the Holocaust. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=326.12s)]
*  The German Chancellor Schultz called them the new Nazis. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=328.28s)]
*  Well, look at the old Nazis. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=331.2s)]
*  The Allies were attacked by Hitler. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=332.88s)]
*  And so they invaded France and then Germany. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  And when they did that, they went into the cities. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=339.08s)]
*  They had to fight the German army that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=341.88s)]
*  was often embedded in the cities, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=343.64s)]
*  in civilian neighborhoods. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=347.24s)]
*  And many civilians were killed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  So who was the blame laid on them? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=350.24s)]
*  Did they say, well, the Nazis are working, the Allies are wrong, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=352.32s)]
*  the Allies should stop fighting? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=355.91999999999996s)]
*  Or they said, look, use force as judiciously as you can, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=357.52s)]
*  but don't give the Nazis any refuge. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=361.68s)]
*  Defeat the Nazis, which is what we're doing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=364.08s)]
*  Prime Minister. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=366.28s)]
*  Using force in the most judicious way, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=366.88s)]
*  but we have to defeat these new Nazis. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  And we will, for our sake, for your sake too. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=371.44s)]
*  I want to ask about the hostages. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=375.08s)]
*  Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=377.2s)]
*  rallied this weekend right across the street [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  from where you are right now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=382.32s)]
*  They're very frustrated that they're not [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=383.88s)]
*  getting more information from you [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  and where their loved ones are. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=387.79999999999995s)]
*  Believe that the government, your government, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  is not doing enough to get them back. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=391.4s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=393.0s)]
*  It's understandable. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=395.2s)]
*  They're under tremendous distress. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=396.0s)]
*  They're under torture. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=397.76s)]
*  You can imagine that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=400.28s)]
*  You have your father, your husband, your son, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  your daughter taken by these savages. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=405.76s)]
*  Are you doing enough? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=408.28s)]
*  We're doing everything we can around the clock, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=410.96s)]
*  and I can't talk about it. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=412.96s)]
*  I've personally met with the hostage families, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=414.88s)]
*  families of hostages several times, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=418.55999999999995s)]
*  and it just tears your heart out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=420.23999999999995s)]
*  But yes, we're doing everything and many things [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  that I can't say here, obviously. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=425.03999999999996s)]
*  But this is one of our two war goals. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  One is to destroy Hamas, and the second [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=431.32s)]
*  is to bring back our hostages, and we'll do everything we can. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=433.12s)]
*  And we think the entire world should join us, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=436.48s)]
*  demand from the Red Cross that it demand visits [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=438.64s)]
*  to the hostages, demand the unconditional release [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=441.56s)]
*  of the hostages, say that this is barbarism that [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=444.2s)]
*  is unacceptable. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=446.72s)]
*  I'd like to see the UN, I'd like to see the UN [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=448.48s)]
*  Secretary General, basically laid the blame on Israel, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=450.88s)]
*  laid the blame on these savages. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=454.52000000000004s)]
*  You demand that they obey international law, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=457.04s)]
*  because Israel is fighting according to international law. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=459.4s)]
*  The Israeli army is doing an exemplary job [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=462.92s)]
*  trying to minimize civilian casualties [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=465.24s)]
*  and maximize terrorist casualties. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=468.12s)]
*  But we need the international community not to give [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=470.76s)]
*  succor, support, and moral support and legitimacy [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=473.48s)]
*  to sheer evil that Hamas represents. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=477.52s)]
*  Support Israel, attack Hamas. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=480.4s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, one of the questions right now [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=482.36s)]
*  is when it comes to hostages, is whether there can be [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=486.68s)]
*  a negotiation that works towards a deal [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=490.72s)]
*  to free large groups of hostages in exchange [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=494.16s)]
*  for a sustained days long pause in fighting. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=496.76s)]
*  Is that acceptable to you? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=500.88s)]
*  And if so, how long of a pause would Israel be willing to allow? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=502.44s)]
*  I said that we're going to pursue the battle [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=509.2s)]
*  to destroy Hamas to its end. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=510.92s)]
*  But I also said that the only ceasefire that we would consider [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=514.08s)]
*  is one in which we have our hostages released. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=518.2800000000001s)]
*  And that remains true. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=521.32s)]
*  Doesn't mean that we can't give humanitarian pause [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=522.48s)]
*  for a few hours in a place, a specific time and place [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=525.2800000000001s)]
*  where we want to have a humanitarian corridor [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  and have the people leave safely. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=531.08s)]
*  We've done that and hundreds of thousands [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=532.88s)]
*  have left the fighting zone in that fashion. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=535.36s)]
*  So how long of a pause would you be willing to support? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, so far we've dealt with a few hours. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=540.4000000000001s)]
*  If you're talking about a ceasefire, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=541.96s)]
*  well, I'm not going to get into that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=543.72s)]
*  No, I'm not talking about a ceasefire. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=544.76s)]
*  Just a longer pause days, for example. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=546.52s)]
*  That's not a pause. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=550.44s)]
*  If you're talking about stopping the fighting, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=552.32s)]
*  that's exactly what Hamas wants. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=554.12s)]
*  Hamas wants an endless series of pauses [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  that basically dissipate the battle against them. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=558.96s)]
*  It's like the Germans after Normandy, you know, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=561.4s)]
*  they say, okay, let's have a ceasefire. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=563.24s)]
*  You guys hold off. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=565.08s)]
*  Let us replenish our supplies. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=567.2s)]
*  Let us get out of our terror tunnels. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=568.9200000000001s)]
*  Let us rearm ourselves and so on. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=571.1600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, we're not going to do that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=573.36s)]
*  The US says that you need to have... [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=574.52s)]
*  In order to have a ceasefire of any... [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=576.44s)]
*  Ceasefire in the entire area, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=580.48s)]
*  that will require the release of our hostages. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=582.4s)]
*  The US says that you need an extended pause [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=586.08s)]
*  in order to get the hostages out. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=588.08s)]
*  Do you not believe that as well? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=590.44s)]
*  Oh, well, we don't disagree with that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=593.2s)]
*  Well, we need to get our hostages out. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=596.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=597.76s)]
*  The US also says that any post-war plan for Gaza [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=598.8000000000001s)]
*  must include Palestinian-led governance [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  and Gaza unified with the West Bank [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=605.8s)]
*  under the Palestinian authority. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=608.76s)]
*  You appeared to reject that yesterday. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=611.48s)]
*  You said Israel will not accept a, quote, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=613.28s)]
*  civilian authority there [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=615.24s)]
*  that educates its children to hate Israel. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  So I just want to be clear. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=619.16s)]
*  Are you saying that Israel would not accept [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=620.12s)]
*  giving control of Gaza over to the Palestinian authority [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=622.64s)]
*  after the war? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=625.92s)]
*  The first thing we have to do is destroy Hamas [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=628.48s)]
*  because otherwise they'll do it again [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=630.76s)]
*  and again and again, and they've said so. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=633.24s)]
*  So we'll destroy Hamas. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=634.6400000000001s)]
*  The second thing we have to understand [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=636.1600000000001s)]
*  is that there has to be an overriding [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=637.48s)]
*  and overreaching Israeli military envelope [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=639.6s)]
*  because we've seen any place that we leave, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=642.6800000000001s)]
*  we just exit, give it to some other force. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=645.6400000000001s)]
*  Very soon terrorism resurges, so we must achieve nothing. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=649.0400000000001s)]
*  The third thing we have to understand [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=652.12s)]
*  is that a civilian authority has to cooperate in two goals. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  One is to demilitarize Gaza, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=657.44s)]
*  and the second is to deradicalize Gaza. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=659.5200000000001s)]
*  And I have to say that the Palestinian authority [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=661.96s)]
*  has unfortunately failed on both counts. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  They don't demilitarize the West Bank, Judea and Samaria. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=668.0s)]
*  We have to do it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=671.48s)]
*  We have to go in and fight the terrorists. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=672.52s)]
*  They don't deradicalize, they teach our children [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=674.4000000000001s)]
*  the hatred of Israel. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=676.88s)]
*  They do pay for slaying, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=678.1600000000001s)]
*  they pay for terrorist murderers and their families. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=679.44s)]
*  The more Jews they kill, the more they pay. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  They refused to this day, 36 days after this savagery [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=684.44s)]
*  to condemn what Hamas did on November 7th. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=690.24s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=695.8800000000001s)]
*  If not the PA, then who? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=696.72s)]
*  Well, there has to be a reconstructed civilian authority. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  There has to be something else. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=700.8800000000001s)]
*  Otherwise we're just falling into that same rabbit hole, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=702.7600000000001s)]
*  and we're gonna have the same result. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=706.6400000000001s)]
*  Remember the PA was already in Gaza. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  When Israel left Gaza, it handed the keys over to the PA. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=710.8800000000001s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=714.4000000000001s)]
*  Within a very short time, Hamas took over, kicked them out. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=715.32s)]
*  They weren't willing to fight Hamas. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=719.12s)]
*  They're still not willing to fight Hamas. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=720.68s)]
*  So you have to have some kind of authority, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  civilian Palestinian authority [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=724.96s)]
*  that is willing to fight the terrorists [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=727.28s)]
*  and educating and importantly, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=729.6s)]
*  must educate their children for a future of peace, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=731.6s)]
*  peace, cooperation, prosperity, cooperation with Israel, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=734.84s)]
*  not the annihilation of Israel. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=738.72s)]
*  And so far that hasn't happened. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=740.16s)]
*  The burden of proof is on the PA [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=742.48s)]
*  and they failed every single cap. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=743.96s)]
*  I say that regrettably, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=746.24s)]
*  but honestly, we have to be realistic about what we expect. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=747.9599999999999s)]
*  We can't fall back on formulas that failed. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=751.64s)]
*  We have to succeed, to succeed, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=754.5999999999999s)]
*  to give Gaza a better future. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=756.64s)]
*  Let's not bring it to a failed past. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=758.56s)]
*  Let's create a different reality there. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=761.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, before I let you go, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=763.24s)]
*  I know you've been asked this several times, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=765.76s)]
*  but I have had multiple people inside Israel [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=769.12s)]
*  reach out to me knowing that I was gonna interview you [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=772.4s)]
*  and say the one thing they wanna hear from you [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=775.1999999999999s)]
*  is that you take personal responsibility [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=777.36s)]
*  for failing to prevent the October 7th attacks [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=779.84s)]
*  and protecting your people. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=782.4s)]
*  I know you say the time for that will come after the war. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=784.08s)]
*  Why won't you take responsibility now? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  I've already addressed that many times. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=789.96s)]
*  And I said this whole question [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=792.12s)]
*  will be addressed after the war. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=793.44s)]
*  Just as people would ask. Why not now? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=795.04s)]
*  Well, did people ask Franklin Roosevelt [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=797.0s)]
*  after Pearl Harbor that question? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=799.44s)]
*  Did people ask George Bush [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=801.48s)]
*  after the surprise attack of November 11th? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=802.96s)]
*  Look, it's a question that needs to be asked. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=805.56s)]
*  I think those questions were asked. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=807.8s)]
*  And I've said that one thing that is important. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=809.1999999999999s)]
*  And I've said we're gonna answer all these questions, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=813.9599999999999s)]
*  including me, I'm gonna be asked tough questions. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  Right now, I think what we have to do [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  is unite the country for one purpose. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=820.4799999999999s)]
*  One purpose alone, and that is to achieve victory. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=823.4s)]
*  That's what I did. We formed a unity government [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=826.04s)]
*  where the country is united as never before. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=828.7199999999999s)]
*  And I think that's what we have to pursue. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=831.28s)]
*  And what the people expect me to do right now [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=833.1199999999999s)]
*  is two things. One, achieve this victory [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=835.16s)]
*  and bring the hostages back. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=837.48s)]
*  And second, assure that Gaza never becomes a place [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  for Israel again. And to Israelis who are disappointed [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=843.12s)]
*  that you still won't take responsibility, you say? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=844.6s)]
*  Well, I said that I'm going to answer [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=848.8s)]
*  all the questions that are required, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=850.76s)]
*  including the questions of responsibility. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=852.64s)]
*  There'll be enough time for that after the war. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=855.0s)]
*  Let's focus on victory. That's my responsibility now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBaQhSrsDYI&t=857.0799999999999s)]
