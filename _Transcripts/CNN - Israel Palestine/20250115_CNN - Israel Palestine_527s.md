# White House official on why he is confident Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal will be implemented
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI)
*  President Biden touted his administration role [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=0.0s)]
*  in securing the ceasefire and hostage deal [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=2.6s)]
*  while also acknowledging cooperation [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=5.16s)]
*  with the incoming Trump team. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=7.92s)]
*  But he bristled when pressed about who deserves credit. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=10.0s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  This deal was developed and negotiated [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=14.76s)]
*  under my administration, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=17.56s)]
*  but its terms will be implemented, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=18.68s)]
*  for the most part, by the next administration. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=21.6s)]
*  In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=24.84s)]
*  I told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=28.92s)]
*  to make sure we're all speaking with the same voice, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=32.6s)]
*  because that's what American presidents do. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=36.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=38.68s)]
*  Who is the books credit for this, Mr. President? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=39.44s)]
*  You or Trump? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=40.52s)]
*  Is that a joke? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=43.84s)]
*  Joining us now, White House National Security [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=46.8s)]
*  Communications Advisor John Kirby. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=49.2s)]
*  John, thanks very much for joining us [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=51.56s)]
*  on this historic and important day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=53.44s)]
*  President-elect Trump says this agreement [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  could only have happened as a result of his election victory. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=57.68s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister's Office released this photo [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=61.76s)]
*  of Prime Minister Netanyahu thanking Trump [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=65.2s)]
*  for his assistance with this agreement. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=67.64s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=70.48s)]
*  There's an awful lot of credit here to go around, Wolf, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=72.08s)]
*  and it's not just on the American side, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=74.68s)]
*  but in the region. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=77.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu himself [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=78.92s)]
*  made some important compromises to move this forward. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=81.6s)]
*  The Qataris, the Egyptians, very much involved in this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=84.44s)]
*  Look, I don't think that the hostages and their families [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=88.08s)]
*  are worried about who's claiming or grabbing credit here. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=90.24s)]
*  And the president doesn't want that to be the focus. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=93.32s)]
*  He wants the focus to be on the implementation of the deal. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=95.44s)]
*  That's where the real hard work is gonna come [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=98.0s)]
*  now that it's been put into place. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=99.84s)]
*  And we know, as the president said, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=101.72s)]
*  it's the next team that's gonna have to do that implementing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=103.2s)]
*  So it was important to him [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=105.36s)]
*  that we approach this as a team, and we did. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=107.4s)]
*  And that's what the American people should expect. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=110.28s)]
*  It's what those hostage families should expect. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=112.6s)]
*  Indeed, it's true. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=114.52s)]
*  President Biden laid out the basic elements [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=115.64s)]
*  of this deal back in May. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=118.12s)]
*  So why did it take so long, John, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=120.0s)]
*  for this agreement to be finalized today? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=121.76s)]
*  There's a couple of factors here, Wolf. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=124.64s)]
*  Number one, Hamas is a radically different organization today [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=126.12s)]
*  than it was back in May. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=129.76s)]
*  They were stronger in May and throughout the summer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=131.08s)]
*  But over the course of those many months, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=132.8s)]
*  due to IDF military action, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=135.72s)]
*  Hamas became dramatically weakened. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=137.76s)]
*  They lost their leader, Senoar. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=140.44s)]
*  They lost other fighters and leaders on the battlefield. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  Tunnels absolutely flattened. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=144.4s)]
*  Infrastructure destroyed. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=146.08s)]
*  They're in a much weaker state now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  The other thing that was different [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=149.16s)]
*  between then and now, Wolf, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=150.52s)]
*  is that Hamas is even further isolated. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=152.4s)]
*  They couldn't count on Hezbollah anymore [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=155.28s)]
*  to be their cavalry because we brokered a ceasefire [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=157.52s)]
*  between Israel and Hezbollah, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=160.96s)]
*  which is still largely holding. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=162.56s)]
*  And Iran is much more weaker [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  because of the attacks that they conducted on Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=166.12s)]
*  There were retaliatory strikes. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=168.76s)]
*  Their air defenses were greatly diminished. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  Iran could not come to their aid any more [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=172.56s)]
*  than Iran could come to Assad's aid [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=174.76000000000002s)]
*  when his regime fell just a couple of weeks ago. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=177.96s)]
*  So more isolated, definitely weaker. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=180.84s)]
*  And then there was also the undercurrent [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=183.44s)]
*  of all this intense diplomacy [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  that we have stayed engaged at since May [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  to get this over the finish line. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=189.36s)]
*  As you know, the Israeli Prime Minister's office [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=191.24s)]
*  issued a statement suggesting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=193.56s)]
*  that several unresolved points remain with this agreement. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=195.28s)]
*  How much concern is there over at the White House [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=199.32s)]
*  where you are that this deal, God forbid, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=201.44s)]
*  potentially could fall apart? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=203.88s)]
*  Well, there's always that possibility, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=205.92s)]
*  but as you heard the president say today, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=207.28s)]
*  he's confident that it will stay in place [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=208.8s)]
*  and that it will be implemented. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=211.4s)]
*  And one of the reasons that gives us that confidence [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=212.64s)]
*  is in fact the teamwork that we worked hard on [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=215.04s)]
*  with the incoming team. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=218.48s)]
*  And Mr. Witkoff, who was in the region, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=219.8s)]
*  who was talking to Brett McGurk, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=222.28s)]
*  our negotiator at the table, multiple times a day. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=223.56s)]
*  And Mr. Witkoff actually helped cinch down [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=226.24s)]
*  some of the details. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=228.28s)]
*  There was great coordination between the two of us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=229.24s)]
*  And because the president-elect made it clear in public [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=231.96s)]
*  that he wanted this deal too, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  and his team wants to make sure that this deal works. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  So they're invested in this as well, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=240.04000000000002s)]
*  and in a significant way. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think that's what gives us confidence [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=244.08s)]
*  that it can be implemented. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  But look, hard work ahead. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  All of both sides have got to stay true [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=248.28s)]
*  to their commitments. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=250.44s)]
*  We have seen in the case in the past [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=251.8s)]
*  where Hamas hasn't always done that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=253.44s)]
*  So I can't say with 100% certainty, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=255.08s)]
*  but the president's confident that this can, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=257.28s)]
*  it can move forward and be implemented for them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=259.52s)]
*  I think it's impressive that president-elect [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=261.64s)]
*  Trump's incoming Middle East advisor, Steve Witkoff, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  has been in very close contact, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=268.55999999999995s)]
*  working very closely together with President Biden's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=270.28s)]
*  Middle East advisor, Brett McGurk. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=273.0s)]
*  I think that's really important. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=275.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=275.91999999999996s)]
*  Two Americans, as you know, John, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=276.76s)]
*  two Americans held in Gaza are on the list of hostages [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=278.59999999999997s)]
*  to be released in the first phase of this agreement. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  What can you tell us about their condition [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  and when can we expect them to be released? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=287.56s)]
*  Well, I couldn't give you a date certain. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=291.52000000000004s)]
*  There are certainly Americans that are in this first tranche. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=293.52000000000004s)]
*  And as you know, Wolf, the first tranche is for the elderly, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  for the sick or the injured, for civilian women. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=299.92s)]
*  And we do have a couple of Americans who qualify [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=302.6s)]
*  in that first tranche and we expect will come out, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=305.24s)]
*  but I couldn't give you an exact date. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=307.2s)]
*  We expect that once we get to Sunday, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  we'll start to see the hostages being released, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=312.64s)]
*  but who's gonna be released on what day is difficult [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=314.6s)]
*  for us to say right at this point. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=316.68s)]
*  And it's Keith Siegel and Saghi Dekelhan. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=318.12s)]
*  Those are the two Americans we expect to be released [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  in this first phase? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=323.56s)]
*  Well, I'd rather not get into the specifics [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  and names at this point, but we do know that there [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=327.68s)]
*  are Americans that qualify in this first tranche [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  and we're looking forward to getting them home [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=333.16s)]
*  and back with their families where they belong. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=334.88s)]
*  Let's hope that happens. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=336.36s)]
*  On another major issue I wanna get to you. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  And next month will mark, as you know, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=340.6s)]
*  the third full year of Russia's brutal war against Ukraine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=342.84s)]
*  Donald Trump has signaled that he will change the way [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=346.32s)]
*  the US has supported Ukraine during this war. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=349.2s)]
*  Can Ukraine continue to fight Russia [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=352.11999999999995s)]
*  without major US military aid? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=354.64s)]
*  And has the Biden administration left them [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  on a path to success in this war? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=359.84s)]
*  The answer to your first question is no. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=362.88s)]
*  And the answer to your second question is yes. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=364.76s)]
*  Ukraine will continue to need international support [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=367.08s)]
*  for their forces in the field. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=370.44s)]
*  And the United States has been the leader [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=372.52s)]
*  in providing that support, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=374.32s)]
*  putting together a coalition of 50 plus nations. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=375.64s)]
*  But if that support continues, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=378.12s)]
*  then Ukraine can continue to succeed on the battlefield. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  And why that's important is not just on the face of it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=382.88s)]
*  You wanna push back on Russian forces [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=385.2s)]
*  and defeat them in the field and regain the territory [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=387.28s)]
*  that belongs to you if you're Ukrainian, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=390.79999999999995s)]
*  but it also helps give you more leverage [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=392.67999999999995s)]
*  and a position of strength if and when [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=395.08s)]
*  this comes to negotiations. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  That's the only way this war's gonna end [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=398.92s)]
*  is through some kind of negotiation. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=400.4s)]
*  We wanna make sure that President Zelensky [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=402.08s)]
*  gets to determine when that is [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=404.12s)]
*  and that he gets to determine how he's gonna negotiate [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=405.68s)]
*  and from what position. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=408.8s)]
*  It's gotta be up to him. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=410.76s)]
*  We don't want that imposed on him. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=411.76s)]
*  That's why we're continuing the support. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=413.16s)]
*  John, as a member of Congress, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=415.2s)]
*  President Biden, as you know, served as chairman [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=416.76s)]
*  of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=419.64s)]
*  and touted his experience when he ran for president [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=421.6s)]
*  back in 2020. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=424.52s)]
*  But in our just released, the brand new CNN poll, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=425.96s)]
*  look at this, just 32% of Americans approve [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=429.12s)]
*  of President Biden's handling of foreign affairs. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=432.68s)]
*  That poll was released today. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=435.23999999999995s)]
*  Why do you think so many Americans think President Biden [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=437.2s)]
*  has done a poor job on the world stage? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I don't think I'm in a position [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=443.4s)]
*  to be able to speak for the American people [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=446.4s)]
*  and what they believe or what they don't believe. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=449.08s)]
*  All I can tell you is having worked for him [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  for two and a half years and certainly before that [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  at the Pentagon, that this is a man who understands [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=455.32s)]
*  the complex nature of foreign policy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=458.56s)]
*  He understands that we're in an inflection point right now, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=461.04s)]
*  a transition point across the world [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=463.56s)]
*  and that American leadership on the world stage matters. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=466.04s)]
*  And that's why from the very beginning, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=468.92s)]
*  he revitalized our alliances and partnerships [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=470.68s)]
*  around the world. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  Where alliances didn't exist to solve problems, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=473.88s)]
*  Joe Biden created them. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=476.2s)]
*  The 50 nations that helped support Ukraine, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=477.56s)]
*  the 20 nations pushing back on the Houthis, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=479.36s)]
*  the AUKUS deal that is gonna allow for Australia [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=481.56s)]
*  to get a nuclear powered submarine. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=484.32s)]
*  Where it didn't exist, Joe Biden created it to exist [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=485.8s)]
*  because he knows that American power is respected, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=488.28s)]
*  American leadership is wanted, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=491.96s)]
*  but it can't be done in an arrogant way. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  It's gotta be collaborative. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=495.56s)]
*  You gotta work with allies and partners. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=496.68s)]
*  This is a man who understands the world [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=499.12s)]
*  unlike any I've ever worked for before. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=500.56s)]
*  And I know as we walk out the door, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=503.28s)]
*  we're handing to the Trump team an American foreign policy [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=505.88s)]
*  that has achieved not just for the American people, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=508.96s)]
*  but for our allies and partners [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=511.68s)]
*  in ways that we hadn't seen before. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=513.16s)]
*  John Kirby, thanks so much for all your important work [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=514.8s)]
*  over these years. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=517.52s)]
*  We go way, way back. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=518.56s)]
*  Appreciate it very much for joining us. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=519.84s)]
*  This exit interview, I know you only have a few days left [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=521.6s)]
*  at the White House. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=524.2s)]
*  Thanks very much. Thanks very much, Wolf. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=525.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gh309ajTuI&t=526.36s)]
