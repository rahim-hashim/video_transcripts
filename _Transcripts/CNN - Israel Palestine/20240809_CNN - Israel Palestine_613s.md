# Former Defense Secretary discusses the role the US plays in Middle East tensions
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM)
*  International pressure is clearly building on both Israel and Hamas to return to negotiations, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=0.0s)]
*  to end the war in Gaza, and to release the remaining hostages. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=6.2s)]
*  This new push underscored by a grave global concern right now that the region, this region, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=10.32s)]
*  the Middle East where I am, is inching closer and closer to the threat of a much wider scale [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=16.36s)]
*  conflict. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=21.84s)]
*  Israel is bracing for strikes from Iran and its heavily armed proxies after it killed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah and Hamas leaders just last week. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=28.48s)]
*  The source familiar with the discussions tells CNN that the talks are scheduled, the mediatory [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  talks are scheduled for next Thursday, August 15th. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=37.16s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister's office says Israel will send a negotiations team to the talks. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=40.96s)]
*  The U.S., Qatar, and Egypt have issued this joint statement. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=46.68s)]
*  They are leading this effort. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=50.64s)]
*  The trio of mediators say, and I'm quoting now, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=52.16s)]
*  That's the end of the quote from those three mediators. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=67.2s)]
*  Let's dig deeper right now. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  Joining us, Leon Panetta. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=72.52s)]
*  He served as U.S. defense secretary and CIA director under President Obama. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, always good to have you join us here on CNN. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=78.96s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=82.67999999999999s)]
*  And as you heard, as you know, Egypt, Israel, and Qatar, they want both Israel and Hamas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=83.88s)]
*  to resume ceasefire and hostage negotiations this coming week. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=89.28s)]
*  In your opinion, Mr. Secretary, how likely is that to happen? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, one thing we know for sure, and you're there, Wolf, is that this is a very dangerous [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=99.32s)]
*  moment in which without question, if the wrong steps are taken by Iran and Hezbollah, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=106.88s)]
*  we could have a larger war on our hands. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=115.88s)]
*  On the other hand, because there are a number of nations that you mentioned that are working [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=119.56s)]
*  diplomatically to try to get Iran and Hezbollah and others to back down and hopefully be able [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=126.56s)]
*  to engage in negotiations, get back to the negotiating table. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=134.44000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure that it's having some impact. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=139.96s)]
*  But right now, I think the situation is one that is a crisis situation. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=143.96s)]
*  And I think that I worry, frankly, that this could result in an escalated war there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=152.08s)]
*  Yeah, all of us are worried about that possibility, especially those of us who are here in the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=162.8s)]
*  region. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=167.56s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, the Biden administration says it will defend Israel if it comes under attack. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=168.56s)]
*  What should the Biden administration be doing right now, do you think, to potentially not [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=174.36s)]
*  further inflame the regional tensions that are underway? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=179.12s)]
*  Well, look, I think the most important thing that the United States is doing right now [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=183.72s)]
*  is deploying our military capabilities to the region in order to make sure that we have [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=189.0s)]
*  in place everything we need in order to defend against airstrikes in Israel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=196.28s)]
*  Iran crossed the line in April in sending almost 300 missiles into Israel itself. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=205.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, because our allies, Israel, others were able to knock down a lot of those [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=213.4s)]
*  missiles, almost 90 percent of those missiles, what happened did not escalate the situation [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=220.64s)]
*  there. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=226.68s)]
*  Whether or not that can happen again, I think is what we're all looking at. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=227.68s)]
*  But having the United States having the time to be able to deploy our destroyers, to deploy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=234.78s)]
*  our air capabilities there as well, and to prepare for that possibility is probably the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=242.67999999999998s)]
*  most important thing that the United States can do right now, and also hopefully urge [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=248.6s)]
*  Israel and the parties to get back to the negotiating table. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=254.14s)]
*  You were the U.S. defense secretary. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=260.2s)]
*  You know the region well. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=262.08s)]
*  You know the issues very, very closely. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=263.24s)]
*  How would you be handling what's going on right now if you were still the defense secretary? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=267.24s)]
*  And I ask the question specifically because Israel is now a member of the U.S. military's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=271.84s)]
*  central command, which is in charge of the whole Middle East, as opposed to when you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  were defense secretary as part of the European command. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=281.14s)]
*  What does that suggest to you about the potential difference? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=284.96s)]
*  Well, what it means is that there's a larger direct focus on Israel and on Israel's enemies. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=292.08s)]
*  And that means that the United States plays a much more important role in terms of trying [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=303.47999999999996s)]
*  to defend Israel. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  And that's as it should be. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  The issue then becomes if in fact Iran or the proxies decide to conduct a massive attack [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=315.84s)]
*  in which a lot of innocent Israelis are killed, it leaves the United States very little option [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  but to go in and help defend Israel in that kind of war. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=332.44s)]
*  Not just with military equipment but with troops as well, is that what you're saying? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=340.12s)]
*  Well, you know, you'd like to believe that we could provide the military capabilities [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=346.32s)]
*  as we have been in order to be able to ensure that Israel can do the fighting and do the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=351.76s)]
*  fighting effectively. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=358.92s)]
*  I think we'll try to exhaust that option. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=360.44s)]
*  But when you're in an escalated war, everything is on the table. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=362.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing as well. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=369.79999999999995s)]
*  Let me return to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  He gave an exclusive interview to Time magazine. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=376.96s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, Netanyahu pushes back against claims that he's drawing out the Gaza campaign [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  to ensure that he remains in political office. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=388.52s)]
*  He calls that accusation against him a canard. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  Do you feel that Prime Minister Netanyahu has resisted a ceasefire deal for personal [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=394.76s)]
*  political reasons as some are alleging? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=399.68s)]
*  You know, I've known Netanyahu for a long time going back to the Clinton administration. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  He's committed to two things. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=413.2s)]
*  He's committed to the survival of Israel but he's also committed to his own survival in [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=414.86s)]
*  office. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=421.72s)]
*  And that combination means that while he's a fighter, he's not much of a peacemaker. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=423.08000000000004s)]
*  And that is the Netanyahu that we're dealing with now. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  In that same Time magazine interview, Netanyahu was asked about the humanitarian crisis in [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=436.72s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=442.52000000000004s)]
*  He denied that Israel has failed to do enough to aid civilians saying this, and I'm quoting [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  him now. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=449.48s)]
*  We've gone out of our way to enable humanitarian assistance since the beginning of the war. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=451.24s)]
*  Clearly the Biden administration, Mr. Secretary, doesn't necessarily agree with his assessment. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=456.12s)]
*  Do you? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=461.0s)]
*  Well, you know, Netanyahu sees the situation through his eyes. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=464.0s)]
*  And that's not necessarily what's really happening. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=471.32s)]
*  He will make the case that somehow Israel bears no responsibility for the humanitarian [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  crisis in Gaza. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=482.16s)]
*  But that's not really the facts. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=484.92s)]
*  Anybody who's been there, anybody who's seen that situation knows very well that Israel [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=488.44000000000005s)]
*  is obviously focused on fighting a war and not really doing very much with regards to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  humanitarian assistance. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=502.36s)]
*  And so right now, the continuing fighting in Gaza, the threat of an even larger war [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=505.44s)]
*  with Iran and its proxies, I think what you're going to see is a very hardline Netanyahu [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=512.6800000000001s)]
*  trying to confront a very hardline Iran. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=523.0s)]
*  Would you be surprised, Mr. Secretary, if Israel launched a preemptive strike right [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=528.48s)]
*  now against Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, for example, and maybe even against Iranian forces [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  inside Iran? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm sure that kind of thinking is on the table. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  If they determine that they have intelligence on a potential attack against Israel, my sense [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=546.36s)]
*  would be that they would take the opportunity to do a precipitous attack in order to stop [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=553.76s)]
*  that kind of confrontation. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=562.2s)]
*  So, yeah, I think they're looking at all the options right now. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  But clearly, what is happening now is that it's a wait and see game to determine just [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=569.4000000000001s)]
*  whether or not Iran and Hezbollah are going to take a major step that will in fact escalate [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  the war. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  The record here is that everybody is pushing now to try to hopefully reduce the chances [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  for that kind of escalation. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=597.6s)]
*  That's worked in the past. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=599.7199999999999s)]
*  I think the hope is that it can work now. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  Let's hope it does. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=605.36s)]
*  Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary, former CIA director, as usual, thank you very [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=606.36s)]
*  much for your analysis. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=610.56s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbnaKBRTqM&t=611.8399999999999s)]
