# Hamas offered ‘extraordinarily generous’ ceasefire proposal, Blinken says
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [April 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk)
*  President Biden is again applying pressure on Israel over its actions in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=0.0s)]
*  The president spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=9.52s)]
*  The White House said Biden made it clear that the U.S. would not support a potential invasion [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=12.68s)]
*  of Ra'aifa without an explicit plan to protect civilians. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=17.36s)]
*  But a source says the primary focus of the call was a potential hostage deal with Hamas. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=20.84s)]
*  It comes after the group released a video of two hostages on Saturday. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  On the left is Israeli Amri Moran. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=29.2s)]
*  On the right is American Israeli Keith Siegel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=32.16s)]
*  In the video, Siegel pleaded for Israel to negotiate a hostage release deal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=35.12s)]
*  It appeared he was speaking under some duress and cannot verify where or when the video [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=38.96s)]
*  was shot. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=45.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, the secretary of state is in Saudi Arabia right now as Hamas is considering a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  new deal calling for the release of hostages held since October 7th in exchange for a pause [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=50.1s)]
*  in the fighting in Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Tony Blinken said Israel has presented Hamas with quote, an extraordinarily generous proposal, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=57.46s)]
*  adding that the militant group is the only thing standing between the people of Gaza [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=63.7s)]
*  and a ceasefire. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=67.02s)]
*  Let's get the latest from CNN national security correspondent, Kylie Atwood. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=68.02s)]
*  Kylie over at the State Department for us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=71.62s)]
*  Kylie, what can you tell us about this proposal? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=73.22s)]
*  Well listen, as you said, the secretary of state very clearly this morning saying that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=75.26s)]
*  in the U.S. opinion, what has been put on the table by Israel for Hamas is an extraordinarily [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=80.26s)]
*  quote, generous proposal. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=86.46s)]
*  And he called on Hamas to accept that deal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=88.5s)]
*  He also said that they have to accept it quickly. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=90.94s)]
*  And our reporting is that some of the demands that Israel had been making has been lessened. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=94.1s)]
*  And so it appears that this could be a proposal that Hamas could accept. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=99.36s)]
*  And the reason for him saying that Hamas has to act quickly is because the backdrop here [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  is that Israel has been saying for some time they plan to invade Ra'a and U.S. officials [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=108.6s)]
*  are very eyes wide open about the fact that they are likely to go ahead with that invasion [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=113.46s)]
*  if there isn't an agreement here for a ceasefire and for hostages to be released. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  So time is truly of the essence. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=122.22s)]
*  Yeah, and Kylie, a source tells CNN that there's a worry inside the State Department that Israel [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=124.58s)]
*  is not using American provided weapons in accordance with international law. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=129.5s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=134.74s)]
*  Yeah, so there's not a consensus opinion within the State Department as to if Israel is using [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=135.94s)]
*  those American made weapons in accordance with international law. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=141.98s)]
*  That's according to a State Department official who spoke with my colleague, Jennifer Hansler. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=145.42s)]
*  And this is important because this is all going to come to a fore next week. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=150.34s)]
*  There is requirement due to a new national security memorandum that President Biden signed [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=155.48s)]
*  at the end of last year for the State Department, for the secretary to provide an actual assessment [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=160.6s)]
*  as to if all of the countries using American made weaponry are doing so in accordance with [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=166.1s)]
*  international law. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=171.62s)]
*  These countries are supposed to provide their rationale, their explanations for the fact [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=172.74s)]
*  that they do believe they are in accordance with international law. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=177.26000000000002s)]
*  The State Department assesses that, provides that to Congress. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=180.14000000000001s)]
*  But because there is disagreement within the State Department over this right now, it's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=183.34s)]
*  going to be interesting to see what the final determination from the Secretary of State [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=186.98000000000002s)]
*  actually is next week when he provides that assessment to Congress. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=190.98000000000002s)]
*  Jim? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=194.66000000000003s)]
*  All right, very important development there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  Kylie Atwood, thank you very much. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=197.46s)]
*  The U.S. Secretary of State is back in the Middle East for the seventh time since the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=199.54s)]
*  start of the Israel-Hamas war and is urging Hamas to accept the latest framework for a [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=202.82s)]
*  Gaza ceasefire. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=207.02s)]
*  Antony Blinken meeting today with regional foreign ministers and other top diplomats [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=208.02s)]
*  at a special forum, a special world economic forum meeting, rather, in Riyadh. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=211.82s)]
*  It comes as a Hamas delegation in Cairo is there to discuss the new proposal for a truce [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=216.02s)]
*  which calls for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners over the span of [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=221.84s)]
*  in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the, quote, restoration of sustainable calm. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=227.57999999999998s)]
*  I want to play for you a little bit more from that meeting when the Saudi foreign minister [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=232.66s)]
*  was asked specifically about the situation in Gaza and Saudi Arabia's role. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=235.9s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=240.94s)]
*  The situation in Gaza obviously is a catastrophe by every measure. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=241.94s)]
*  A humanitarian, but also a complete failing of the existing political system to deal with [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=247.66s)]
*  that crisis. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=254.78s)]
*  We in the region are not going to focus only on solving the crisis of the moment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=256.34s)]
*  We are going to look at how we can solve the bigger problem in the context of Gaza. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=263.29999999999995s)]
*  That is a real commitment to a two-state solution. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=269.29999999999995s)]
*  That is a credible, irreversible path to a Palestinian state. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=273.52s)]
*  That's the only reasonable and credible solution that guarantees us from not having to come [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=277.32s)]
*  back to this same situation two, three, four years down the line. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=282.72s)]
*  The Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs also pointing to reduce conflict in the region. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=293.48s)]
*  Our objective is to link the region with the world and to be able to put the resources [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=294.48s)]
*  of the region together so we can create synergies that have a positive impact on all the inhabitants [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=303.68s)]
*  of the region. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=309.36s)]
*  This is complicated by the tensions that we have in the region. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=310.36s)]
*  So our objective is to try to put an end to these tensions so we can focus on the things [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=313.64s)]
*  that matter, economic development and prosperity. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=318.8s)]
*  The crisis in Gaza, understandably top of mind at the World Economic Forum Conference. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  That is where my colleague, Becky Anderson, sat down with the forum's president. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=328.14s)]
*  They began by speaking about the future of the enclave and what will be needed to help [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=331.64s)]
*  rebuild. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=336.68s)]
*  There will be no willingness among any donors to rebuild Gaza if there's no guarantee that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=338.92s)]
*  there will not be a Gaza war again because who will rebuild something that will be bombed [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=345.72s)]
*  again? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  That means an irreversible path to Palestinian statehood. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=350.28000000000003s)]
*  From the conversations that you are having here, and these are around a unified Arab [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=354.8s)]
*  strategy for Gaza and Palestinians going forward, is your sense that we are close? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=362.15999999999997s)]
*  I think with this inspiring Gaza, at least there will be a willingness to have real political [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=370.24s)]
*  discussions. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=379.71999999999997s)]
*  What is in it for Israel is of course a potential deal with, for example, Saudi Arabia. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=381.08s)]
*  Saudi Arabia will then gain additional support from the US on the military side. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=388.48s)]
*  But we know that this has taken time also before. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  And I guess there is also complications with the political situation in Israel. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=400.04s)]
*  Is there a willingness to work for a two-state solution? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  And then we have the American elections coming up too. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  Some people say that it is not possible to move before or after those elections because [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=415.44s)]
*  a plan now I think has to also be supported very strongly from outside. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=420.16s)]
*  You will have to have the Arab countries and the US and other key players saying this is [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=425.6s)]
*  the deal. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=431.0s)]
*  Take it or leave it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=432.28s)]
*  Important points of course. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=434.28s)]
*  As terms of the economic picture for the region, it is not defined of course by conflicts. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=436.52s)]
*  It's incredibly complex. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=440.84s)]
*  The host of the World Economic Forum is a case in point. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=442.52000000000004s)]
*  Here's more about Saudi Arabia's current trajectory. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=447.12s)]
*  So it is very significant that Saudi Arabia has reached already this big milestone of 50% [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=451.04s)]
*  of their economy is now based on non-oil and gas. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=461.68s)]
*  This was the plan for 2030 that the conference launched. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=465.12s)]
*  And now we are in 2024. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=468.56s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=471.44s)]
*  But we also see other GCCs that are doing really well. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=473.12s)]
*  UAE also with their investments now in AI. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=476.12s)]
*  They have a lot of talent there. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=479.48s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=481.64s)]
*  But then the Middle East is kind of two. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=482.64s)]
*  There is the GCC and then there are other Middle Eastern countries that are really, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=485.2s)]
*  really struggling. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=490.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm assuming that you will look at a country like the Kingdom and say here's a great example [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=491.8s)]
*  of how that kind of portfolio comes together successfully. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  Again, how does one take what is going on here and around this region as a starter for [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  10 as it were when you're looking at the wider world? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=510.0s)]
*  So Saudi Arabia is now inviting investments. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  That's important. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=517.88s)]
*  We're seeing people also, expats coming to the Kingdom and they also have an open trade policy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=518.88s)]
*  They're reducing tariffs and they're not sticking to protectionism. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=525.52s)]
*  The challenge globally is that trade was the engine of growth for decades. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=529.6s)]
*  So trade was growing much faster than the global economy. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=535.32s)]
*  No trade is growing slower. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=538.6s)]
*  Then that is also leading to more anemic growth. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=540.28s)]
*  So what we have to avoid is that the 20s become the 1970s. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkKjdA2itXk&t=544.52s)]
