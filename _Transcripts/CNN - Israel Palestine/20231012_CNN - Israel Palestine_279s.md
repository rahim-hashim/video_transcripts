# See training camps used by Hamas for attack on Israel
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g)
*  Last night in our continuing investigation of how Hamas planned Saturday's attack, we [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=0.0s)]
*  brought you the story of the Hamas official who masterminded the brutal assault, a shadowy [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=4.66s)]
*  figure known as the Guest, for his need to lodge in a different location every night [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=8.92s)]
*  to stay alive. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=14.0s)]
*  Tonight, Kursa Ward joins us again with new information about where these gunmen trained [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=15.0s)]
*  and how they were right under the noses, in some cases, of the Israeli Defense Forces [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=19.78s)]
*  for years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=23.84s)]
*  Kursa, what have you learned? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=24.84s)]
*  That's right Anderson, you know there's been so much discussion about the intelligence [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=28.64s)]
*  failures that led up to the atrocities last Saturday and CNN's open source investigator [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=31.96s)]
*  Paul Murphy has spent the last few days poring through years of social media video, satellite [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=38.52s)]
*  imagery and the results and the findings are shocking. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=46.0s)]
*  Propaganda videos put out by Hamas revealed chilling details about the years of preparations [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=50.6s)]
*  that went into Saturday's bloody attacks right under Israel's nose. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=59.2s)]
*  Analyzing metadata from the videos, a CNN investigation can reveal the presence of at [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=64.88s)]
*  least six training sites inside Gaza, one just 720 meters from the most heavily fortified [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=69.92s)]
*  and patrolled part of Israel's border. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=77.68s)]
*  In that camp, Hamas recreated an Israeli compound with elements of the nearby border crossing, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=80.44000000000001s)]
*  including an insignia of the Erez battalion. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=87.2s)]
*  The videos show they even practiced taking prisoners and zip tying their hands at the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=90.56s)]
*  camp. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=95.36000000000001s)]
*  Satellite imagery indicates the camp was constructed within the last year and a half. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  At two other locations in the southern part of Gaza, Hamas trained for their audacious [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=101.72s)]
*  paraglider assault, rehearsing takeoffs and landings. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=106.68s)]
*  At all six sites, two years of satellite imagery reviewed by CNN shows no indication of offensive [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=111.28s)]
*  Israeli military action. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=118.64000000000001s)]
*  The imagery instead shows that in the last two years, some camps even expanded into surrounding [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=121.22000000000001s)]
*  farmland and that there was activity in the last several months at the camps. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=127.0s)]
*  The stunning revelations raise questions as to how Hamas was able to train so openly, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=132.18s)]
*  so close to the border for so long and why Israeli officials were unable to pick up on [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=138.26000000000002s)]
*  and prevent the October 7th attack. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=144.54000000000002s)]
*  Kershia, what's the IDF's response to this? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=147.82s)]
*  So we of course reached out and asked them for a statement, which they have provided. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  I want to read it verbatim. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=158.74s)]
*  We cannot provide answers to your questions since they relate to the complex analysis [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=160.42s)]
*  of intelligence at the same time that we are fighting a war. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=165.04s)]
*  This topic, together with numerous other issues, will be investigated by the IDF at the end [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=168.66s)]
*  of the war. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=175.38s)]
*  And it is worth mentioning, Anderson, that historically there have been many strikes [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=176.38s)]
*  that Israeli defense forces have made on Hamas training camps. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=180.82s)]
*  And also I would just mention these questions that we're asking are questions that a lot [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=185.5s)]
*  of Israelis want answers to. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=190.7s)]
*  The timing may not be right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=193.3s)]
*  I think people appreciate that that's not necessarily the priority, but they will want [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=195.18s)]
*  those answers, Anderson. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=199.62s)]
*  There's also questions about U.S. intelligence failures, assuming that, I mean, given the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=202.98s)]
*  U.S. intelligence capabilities, that they didn't see these either. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=211.14s)]
*  I think there are many questions, Anderson, about how on earth this could have happened. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=216.7s)]
*  I mean, you look at that video of training with a basic replica of the era's border crossing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=222.7s)]
*  that was less than a kilometer away from the border crossing. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  You see the scale and the scope of some of those camps. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=234.1s)]
*  It's hard to fathom or understand that it would be possible that the Israelis and other [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=240.04s)]
*  supportive nations would not be aware of it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=246.11999999999998s)]
*  The assumption may be that they were aware of it, that they perhaps didn't understand [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  or misinterpreted the intelligence, didn't see it as a direct threat. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=255.22s)]
*  Again, that's speculative. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=259.28s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=261.14s)]
*  What we do know is that there will be, at some point, a deep dive investigation into [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=262.36s)]
*  this by the Israelis, and the Israeli people will want to know who should be held accountable. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=268.88s)]
*  Yeah, Clarissa Ward, appreciate it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koXBvLert_g&t=278.68s)]
