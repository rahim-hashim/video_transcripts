# Foreign affairs expert reacts to Israel's ground operation into Lebanon
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU)
*  That and many of the images from the state today are North Carolina state health officials today say that 22 acute care hospitals there are now [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=0.0s)]
*  Reconnected to the power grid after being on generator power for several days [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  They also say they're maintaining close contact with the facilities and keeping them supply with food water and other supplies that they need to stay [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  Operational that is certainly welcome news [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=17.0s)]
*  But only as our Gary Tugman reports a glimmer in what are for so many right now some very dark days [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=19.52s)]
*  This area is known as Green River Cove. It's right near Hendersonville, North Carolina [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=24.8s)]
*  Southeast of Asheville this road is treacherous even in the best of times that it rains [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=29.8s)]
*  It's even more treacherous, but now it has been devastated from the remnants of the storm [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=36.04s)]
*  You can see the guardrail is gone the drop here off the side of the road which has been so heavily damaged is about a hundred feet down [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=40.56s)]
*  Cars are not supposed to be on here anymore. There are also houses below [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=47.44s)]
*  We've talked to some people who live in the area [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=51.64s)]
*  They say they were trying to get down to the houses to see if people they know are still there because they haven't been able to find [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=53.96s)]
*  Out what happened to those people but they weren't able to hike down and neither are we we have been told that there have been [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=59.4s)]
*  Helicopter rescues of people who live in the homes below but there's absolutely no way to know for sure if there are still people [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=65.48s)]
*  Who are in those homes that have been damaged below us? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=72.44s)]
*  We decided to go down the hill farther [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=76.36s)]
*  We decided to go down the hill farther and what we saw is the literal and figurative end of the road [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=78.8s)]
*  the devastation of the storm [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=86.0s)]
*  Look what it led to this is the street right here and you can see [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=88.16s)]
*  That the street just comes to an end before plunging down here these boulders that are right here [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=93.6s)]
*  The locals here say these boulders actually moved from the force of the storm [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  All the houses in front of mine on the riverside of the road [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=104.6s)]
*  Are gone Brad McMillan and Nick wolf both live in this area. Their homes are okay, but the experience has been traumatic [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=109.8s)]
*  We moved here because the Green River Narrows is an iconic piece of class 5 whitewater and we're whitewater kayakers [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  So we moved our whole lives down here for this area and these these riverbeds and and they've all been completely destroyed and rearranged [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=125.84s)]
*  so [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=134.4s)]
*  It's extremely emotional on a lot of different levels [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=136.2s)]
*  Near Greenwater Cove is the small town of Saluda, North Carolina population of only about 800 people [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't know if anyone who was killed or injured in this town [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  There's lots of damages to the businesses in the homes right over here [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=150.28s)]
*  This is the Green River barbecue local restaurant known for its ribs [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=154.28s)]
*  This business is more than 40 years old but the people who own it right now only bought it eight months ago [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  You can see all over the floor this mud it keeps getting deeper and deeper as you walk in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=164.24s)]
*  Because there was a mudslide in this part of the building. You can see how deep the mud has gotten right here [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=170.08s)]
*  The mud came in through a crevice [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  inside this wall [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  Bree and Tom has are the restaurant owners [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=180.12s)]
*  It's overwhelming it's really daunting trying to think of what our next steps are [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=183.12s)]
*  Insurance doesn't cover mudslides. So that's no help [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  We've talked to people about getting the tree off the building and it's gonna be weeks before you know [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  We can get to us. How is this gonna be financially for you? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=197.32s)]
*  devastating yeah [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=201.2s)]
*  Gary I mean were there emergency personnel on the scene when you were in Green River Cove [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=204.28s)]
*  So while we were there Anderson we didn't see any emergency personnel [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=209.2s)]
*  But that doesn't mean the men and the women who are doing the emergency work aren't heroes [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=212.76s)]
*  They're just so many neighborhoods throughout Western North Carolina where they have to be they can't be everywhere all the time [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=216.56s)]
*  We did mention there were helicopter rescues over the weekend one thing [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=222.2s)]
*  I think is very important to mention because we cover so many hurricanes and tropical storms and tornadoes [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=225.6s)]
*  I think a lot of drivers believe there will always be a gate or a sign telling you not to use a certain road and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=230.6s)]
*  So many roads are destroyed you can't have gates or signs everywhere and that road we were on today while we were driving [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=236.28s)]
*  There was no gate or sign and at one point we hit a mud patch and we kind of slid over [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=241.28s)]
*  Way closer to the cliff than I wanted to be so I think it's important to warn people about that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=246.68s)]
*  Please be careful when you're driving after these storms [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=251.0s)]
*  Gary thanks very much as we mentioned President Biden will visit the area on Wednesday [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=253.0s)]
*  Vice President Harris cut short a west coast trip returned to Washington and visited FEMA headquarters [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=258.04s)]
*  Over the past few days our nation has endured some of the worst destruction and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=266.35999999999996s)]
*  Devastation that we have seen in quite some time and we have responded with our best [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=272.32s)]
*  With the best folks who are on the ground and here [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  Doing the kind of work that is about rising to a moment of crisis to do everything we can [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=282.52s)]
*  To lift up folks who deserve to be seen and heard [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  The former president also weighed in from Georgia with a lie about the Republican governor of Georgia not getting the help he needs from Washington [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=292.08s)]
*  It's a lie made all the more brazen because of what the governor himself had already said just a couple hours earlier [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=299.44s)]
*  Here's what both men said [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  The governor's doing a very good job. He's having a hard time getting the president on the phone. I guess [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  I [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=313.6s)]
*  The president just called me yesterday afternoon [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=318.0s)]
*  I missed him and called him right back and he just said hey, what do you need and I told him, you know [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=320.8s)]
*  We we got what we need we'll work through the federal process [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=326.6s)]
*  He offered that if there's no other things we need just to call him directly, which I appreciate that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=329.6s)]
*  Well late today President Biden was asked about this. Take a look [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=335.96s)]
*  He's lying and the governor told him he was lying [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=339.52s)]
*  The governor told me he's lying. I spoken to the governor spending time with him and he told me he's lying [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  I don't know why he does this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=348.44s)]
*  Well needed to say with all the real problems on the ground right now [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=350.44s)]
*  It says a lot that someone is adding a made-up problem to the list [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=353.08s)]
*  Join us now to talk first and foremost about those very real problems, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=356.36s)]
*  So Governor Cooper, where do things stand tonight in terms of getting food and water people who are stranded in Western, North Carolina? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=360.76s)]
*  And you know getting power and phone service [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  Still the number one priority is making sure that we are saving lives [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=370.35999999999996s)]
*  There are 92 search and rescue teams who are active right now and who are still bringing people to safety [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  I was in Asheville today at the landing zone where we are bringing in food and water [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=382.76s)]
*  I was also there with Administrator Chris well of the [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=389.4s)]
*  Of FEMA she's going to be with us the next few days. She was with me all day today [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=392.92s)]
*  They've delivered a million liters of water [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=399.8s)]
*  600,000 meals [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=403.86s)]
*  We have sent out hundreds of pallets to 20 different locations throughout western, North Carolina [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  We have a beautiful [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=413.64s)]
*  beautiful mountains in North Carolina [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=415.48s)]
*  But they are rugged sometimes to get through even on a beautiful day [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=418.6s)]
*  After this catastrophic storm, it is very difficult to get to all of those places. That's why we are relying on air power [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  I also talked to a lot of people. I went to a hospital spoke with nurses who are working hard [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=432.36s)]
*  Spending the night in the hospital. I went and talked with restaurant homeowners who are opening their restaurants and serving [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=438.74s)]
*  Free food to people I talked with people who are running some hotels who have just opened their hotels and they're letting [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=446.35999999999996s)]
*  First responders come to spend the night who have come from other states to help us [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  This is a strong community [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=459.4s)]
*  pulling together to help each other [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=461.79999999999995s)]
*  There's a lot to do in the short term [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=465.0s)]
*  There's going to be a monumental task to recover in the long in the long term [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  Do you have a sense right now of how many people are still missing or unaccounted for [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=472.84s)]
*  So we've had [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=479.32s)]
*  2,900 calls over the entire time to our 211 [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=481.61999999999995s)]
*  To say that we can't get in touch with somebody [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=486.44s)]
*  I don't I know that a lot of people [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=490.35999999999996s)]
*  Have gotten in touch with their people as our cell phone service is gradually coming back up [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=493.08s)]
*  I talked with several people today one this morning when I was there saying that they hadn't heard from their brother [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=499.96s)]
*  By this afternoon they had so there's not a real tally of that to my understanding [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=507.0s)]
*  But what I do know is that when we get these calls there are teams that are going out and doing [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=513.24s)]
*  Welfare checks and knocking on doors to see if people are there [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=521.24s)]
*  In addition to continuing to rescue people from these waters [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=526.76s)]
*  We still have some rising rivers and the potential for more damage [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=530.28s)]
*  But i'll tell you this this catastrophic event is one that north carolinians can overcome [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=535.4s)]
*  We just all have to to work together and this is an [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=541.08s)]
*  unprecedented [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=545.14s)]
*  massive effort [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=546.36s)]
*  That is being coordinated among local state federal [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=548.2s)]
*  Nonprofits [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=552.04s)]
*  It's been amazing to see the work that's that's going on. We've just got to make sure that it reaches every corner [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=553.72s)]
*  Of western north carolina and that is going to be a large task. I'll be going back in the morning [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=560.92s)]
*  I'll be going to jackson county in addition to bunkum county and we're going to continue to work to help people [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=567.08s)]
*  I know politics is lasting on your mind [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=573.48s)]
*  I do want to give you the opportunity to respond to something that the former president has said about north carolina [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=576.12s)]
*  And you he said i'll be there shortly [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=581.4s)]
*  But don't like the reports that i'm getting about the federal government and the democrat governor of the state going out of their way [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=583.7199999999999s)]
*  To not help people in republican areas end quote [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=588.6s)]
*  Do you have any response to that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=593.8s)]
*  You know, it makes no difference who you are [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=596.68s)]
*  If you need help, we are going to provide it [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwA9LbDfefU&t=600.76s)]
