# Three reasons why experts say Hamas' recent attack is 'unprecedented'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg)
*  The scale of this, the brutality is truly unprecedented. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=0.0s)]
*  Completely unprecedented attack. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  This is completely unprecedented here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=5.44s)]
*  The conflict between Israel and the Palestinians is not new. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=7.84s)]
*  In fact, it's been going on since before Israel's founding in 1948. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=11.44s)]
*  So why is Hamas's latest attack on Israel so unprecedented? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  First, the surprise of the attack. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=21.12s)]
*  On October 7th, Hamas launched a barrage of rockets towards Israel [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=25.76s)]
*  while gunmen entered Israel from Gaza. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=29.36s)]
*  Israel has not seen this kind of infiltration of military bases, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=32.32s)]
*  towns and kibbutzim in its 75-year history. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=36.48s)]
*  The country is known for having one of the world's most impressive armed forces, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=42.24s)]
*  a premier intelligence agency and sophisticated border security. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=46.239999999999995s)]
*  But this attack seemed to catch them off guard. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=50.32s)]
*  The U.S. said they received no tactical-level intelligence [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=53.68s)]
*  that an attack of this size would happen on this day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=56.72s)]
*  A senior U.S. intelligence official told CNN that the capability of Hamas [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=60.64s)]
*  to coordinate attacks on Israeli towns without detection [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=65.12s)]
*  has raised concerns about technological blind spots for U.S. intelligence. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=68.64s)]
*  Second, the intensity of the attack. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=74.48s)]
*  Israel Defense Forces have said that more than 5,000 rockets have been launched [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=77.44s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip since October 7th. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=81.6s)]
*  To put that into context, in 2021, during the 11-day war with Hamas, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=84.24s)]
*  some 4,300 rockets were fired. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=88.8s)]
*  Following Saturday's attack, Israel has formally declared war on Hamas, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=91.6s)]
*  the first such declaration in 50 years, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=95.28s)]
*  setting the stage for a major military operation in Gaza. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=98.16s)]
*  Israeli forces are battling militants in southern Israel [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=103.84s)]
*  and have been pounding Gaza with airstrikes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=107.28s)]
*  By the conflict's third day, over 900 people were killed in Israel, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  while authorities in Gaza said over 680 people have been killed in the Palestinian enclave. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=114.24s)]
*  On October 9th, Israel, which controls most of the importation of basic goods into Gaza, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=120.72s)]
*  ordered a complete siege on the Palestinian enclave. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  No electricity, food, water or fuel will be delivered there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=128.8s)]
*  Lastly, the hostage situation. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=133.68s)]
*  Hamas says it is holding more than 100 hostages in Gaza. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  The group claims that this includes high-ranking army officers, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=139.04s)]
*  but it also includes women, the elderly and children. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=142.48s)]
*  It's been more than 17 years since an Israeli soldier was taken hostage [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=145.6s)]
*  in an assault on the country's territory. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=149.11999999999998s)]
*  Hamas says the hostages are now being held in locations across Gaza, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=151.27999999999997s)]
*  which could complicate Israel's response to the militant group's deadly attack. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeQCWiUhbHg&t=155.44s)]
