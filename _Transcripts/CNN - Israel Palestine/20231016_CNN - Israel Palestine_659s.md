# Israeli father describes wife and daughters being taken by Hamas as 'hell'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg)
*  One of the family members desperately holding out hope that some of these hostages will be rescued is Yoni Asher. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=0.0s)]
*  He is missing his wife and his two young daughters. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=4.72s)]
*  They were taken while visiting his mother-in-law near Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=7.84s)]
*  Our viewers will remember that we first spoke to Yoni on the day of the Hamas attack, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=10.88s)]
*  just hours after he first saw his family in this viral video online. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=15.68s)]
*  You can see a gunman placing a cloth over his wife's head. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  His mother-in-law and his two daughters are huddled in the back of the truck. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=23.28s)]
*  After seeing this video, Yoni tried to track his wife's location. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=27.04s)]
*  It said her phone was in Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  We have been checking in with Yoni ever since then, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=33.04s)]
*  and I was able to meet him in person over the weekend, traveling to his home north of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  Here's our conversation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=42.24s)]
*  Well, Yoni, um, the chance to see each other and see you in person. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=45.44s)]
*  How are you doing now? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, um, eight days since my wife and two daughters got kidnapped, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm realizing that I got to see the gates of hell. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=64.08s)]
*  I got to see how hell looks like. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=74.8s)]
*  I don't know if there are any more tears left in me, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  but it became clear to me that I saw hell. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  I saw what hell looks like. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it's not only the phone call that I got from my wife, 10 a.m., [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  telling me that they're entering the house, shooting, and that we got disconnected. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=95.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's not even the phone call that I got from my wife, 10 a.m., [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  disconnected. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=105.6s)]
*  And it's not even the video, nine seconds long video, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=106.64s)]
*  which I saw my wife getting taken with my two daughters, recognizing them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=110.55999999999999s)]
*  Just like that, after a few hours of nerve-racking time, which I tried to get information. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=119.36s)]
*  The hell was the images. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  I didn't watch them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=131.12s)]
*  I heard, I understand very quickly that when I saw that, when I knew [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=132.16s)]
*  that there is even a possibility they are held by such, I don't know how to call, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=142.64s)]
*  that they are held by them. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=150.96s)]
*  It was even worse than the video. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=156.48s)]
*  Because you think about what? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=160.24s)]
*  I mean, in every moment, I don't know what they're going through. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  I only saw them kidnapped. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  I only saw them getting on some kind of vehicle. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=166.96s)]
*  You can see from that video, it's pretty familiar. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=170.8s)]
*  My wife getting covered by her head. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=174.24s)]
*  All the women were screaming all around. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=175.84s)]
*  That was the image I saw last Saturday, 7th of October. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=178.4s)]
*  And I tell you, I don't know if I can explain yet. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  But like I said, I don't know if you ever thought about it, but sometimes we think, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  what is the apocalypse scenario? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=199.36s)]
*  What is the, what hell looks like? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=201.52s)]
*  When I saw the images, Erin, every minute is forever. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=208.0s)]
*  No, you're living it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=216.72s)]
*  Forever. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=218.8s)]
*  You mean, what have you heard about them as the government? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=219.3s)]
*  Are they updating you? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  Are they telling you anything about what they're doing or where they think they may be? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=226.26000000000002s)]
*  I mean, even things like, are they even able to tell you whether they think they're together? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=232.18s)]
*  Well, you know, there is the channel that the authorities are in contact with me. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=237.46s)]
*  But as you know, these things are not simple. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=249.62s)]
*  They are sometimes can be extremely complicated. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=254.58s)]
*  I'm not diplomacy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=258.66s)]
*  I have no diplomacy or security training. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=260.26s)]
*  I have no understanding in these kind of matters. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=263.86s)]
*  It's not my area, but they are in touch with me and I only know what I knew last Saturday. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  It's the only thing I knew. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  And I live here in uncertainty and it's, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=276.34s)]
*  I'm hanging between the earth and heaven and I [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=281.46s)]
*  move in between the desperation, sometimes hope, but I don't know. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=285.06s)]
*  I know the time is critical. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=290.98s)]
*  I know that they need medicine. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=292.58s)]
*  I know that they are babies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=294.02s)]
*  My little baby daughter, Aviv, is not yet three. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=295.86s)]
*  In January, she will be three. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=298.26s)]
*  In the same month, the same month, January. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=301.38s)]
*  Also, my older, Raz, will be five. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=304.18s)]
*  They are celebrated together in the same month. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=307.62s)]
*  They are good friends. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=312.02s)]
*  They love each other. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=313.94s)]
*  I hope that they are alive and they are well, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=316.26s)]
*  and I hope that they are taking care of each other. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=318.18s)]
*  With their mother. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=323.22s)]
*  What happened to this house? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=324.66s)]
*  How it became a media, an office to save them. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  I just want them to be here. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=333.94s)]
*  I cannot start to explain to you what smart, beautiful girls they are. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=337.94s)]
*  I can't even start. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  When we sit here, I think that you sit here, this is, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=347.06s)]
*  you have so many visions of when you and Jerome maybe in the kitchen and they were here, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=352.1s)]
*  where they were playing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=356.82s)]
*  This is their special area. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=358.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=359.86s)]
*  Well, you know, Erin, I don't allow myself to. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=362.98s)]
*  I can't. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  I can't profound in these visions. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=370.74s)]
*  I want to remember the sound of the voice, the smell of their hair. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  But it's hard. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=381.62s)]
*  I know that I have to be strong for them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=383.22s)]
*  I can't look at a video of them. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=386.26s)]
*  Not even one. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=389.85999999999996s)]
*  I know that many videos were published by us, me and my family and friends who are helping me. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=390.73999999999995s)]
*  I didn't watch single one. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=395.53999999999996s)]
*  So you don't go through your phone and watch. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=398.74s)]
*  I can't. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=400.74s)]
*  You asked me about the last few days. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  The last few days. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  Something was something that the body and the mind is very hard to. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=410.66s)]
*  I don't have any psychology training also, but I guess it's something that takes the spirit out [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=415.7s)]
*  of the body or something because there is a. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=422.58s)]
*  I can't, I can't even process. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=428.42s)]
*  You wanted us to look at their shoes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  Why their shoes? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=438.18s)]
*  You need how they, you know, they are girly girls. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=440.58s)]
*  They, they like shoes. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=444.98s)]
*  I see pink. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=446.66s)]
*  They like they are willing to wear only dresses. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=447.38s)]
*  It's you need to convince them to wear a shirt and pants. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=451.7s)]
*  They want only dresses. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=455.86s)]
*  Yes, they like they like girly stuff. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=457.38s)]
*  Making us food in this toy kitchen, bringing me that food. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=462.18s)]
*  I can talk with you about it right now, but. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=468.26s)]
*  I guess something happened to the mind and the spirit in situation like this. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=474.18s)]
*  For me anyway. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=479.38s)]
*  And your wife. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=482.1s)]
*  You know, you must be thinking of her and. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=484.5s)]
*  How strong she is. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=491.46s)]
*  She is. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=493.94s)]
*  She is, you know. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=495.3s)]
*  Since I have two little daughters, I learned that what is the power of a woman? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=497.86s)]
*  What is how strong a woman is? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=502.82s)]
*  A lot more than us, man. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=509.06s)]
*  You know. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=511.06s)]
*  She sacrificed so much. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=513.0600000000001s)]
*  It took us three years to bring to the world. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=515.22s)]
*  Raz, our older. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=517.54s)]
*  Our first born. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=520.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=521.54s)]
*  And. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oM8p96ZFNg&t=522.1999999999999s)]
