# Military analyst: Explosions may represent beginning of troop movement into Gaza Strip
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs)
*  What is the very latest you're seeing and hearing tonight amidst these reports of thousands of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=0.0s)]
*  soldiers, Israeli soldiers, pouring into Gaza as we speak? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=4.8s)]
*  Well, Erin, more than seven hours now after Israel began this intensified bombing campaign [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=10.4s)]
*  and a expanded ground operation inside of Gaza, we are continuing to hear [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=16.4s)]
*  steady thuds of explosions coming from inside the Gaza Strip. It is extremely rare for us to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=22.64s)]
*  continue to be hearing explosions this late at night, and yet it has been constant for the past [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=29.36s)]
*  seven hours. Not only the most intense and sustained bombardment of Gaza that we have been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=34.16s)]
*  hearing over the nearly three weeks that we have been covering this war, but the loudest booms [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=39.28s)]
*  shaking really this hotel where we are, which is about six miles away from the Gaza Strip. And we [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  are also hearing helicopters overhead, drone activity as well. These are the sights and sounds [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=51.44s)]
*  that we have not heard over the last several weeks. And the images coming out of Gaza of these [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=57.04s)]
*  strikes are just absolutely stunning and terrifying when you consider the fact that there are people [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=62.0s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. And we know that the civilian casualties have only been rising over these recent [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=68.0s)]
*  days as Israel has been intensifying its strikes in Gaza and also beginning to carry out some of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=73.84s)]
*  these targeted raids, which it says are intended to try and take out these Hamas tunnels and other [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=79.2s)]
*  infrastructure in preparation for a larger scale ground invasion of Gaza. Now, what we don't know, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=84.64s)]
*  Aaron, is whether or not this expanded ground operation that we are witnessing this evening, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=90.56s)]
*  whether or not that is that ground invasion that top Israeli military and political leaders have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=95.68s)]
*  been telegraphing now for days, vowing that it will come at a time and place of Israel's choosing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=102.4s)]
*  We don't know yet whether that has begun this evening, but what we do know, as you hear more [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=108.64s)]
*  thuds overhead right now, is that this could risk the negotiations that have been ongoing, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=114.0s)]
*  very sensitive, complex negotiations in recent days to try and secure the release of some of [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=120.16s)]
*  those civilian hostages being held inside of Gaza. Earlier today, I spoke with a senior U.S. official [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=126.0s)]
*  who said that regardless of what Israel is doing tonight, expanding this operation, that those talks [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=132.0s)]
*  will continue. But again, certainly less optimism now about the fate of those talks than earlier in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=137.76s)]
*  the day. Aaron? Hi, Jeremy. Thank you very much. And Ashkolan, I want to go now to Elan Levy, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=143.68s)]
*  the Israeli government spokesman here. You are here with me after two o'clock in the morning. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=150.88s)]
*  You are here for a reason. There's a lot happening right now. What is Israel doing tonight? Israel, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  at the moment, is pushing ahead with its campaign to defeat and destroy Hamas in response to the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  October 7th massacre. You know, it's been only three weeks since Hamas death squads invaded [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=165.28s)]
*  southern Israel, butchering, burning, beheading, raping, torturing, mutilating their way through [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=170.0s)]
*  our southern communities. They killed 1,400 people with most spectacular, cruel violence, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=175.84s)]
*  injured over 5,000 people, took 230 people hostage into the Gaza Strip, including 30 children, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=181.12s)]
*  including 30 children. And Israel has decided we can no longer live with this jihadi enclave on [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=187.6s)]
*  our borders. This isn't another round of conflict that's going to end with a ceasefire and Hamas [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=192.64s)]
*  deterred. This is a war, a war that Hamas declared on us on October 7th and a war that we're going [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=197.92s)]
*  to win. All right, so we know three weeks into this, thousands and thousands of airstrikes, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  special forces raids, largest ground assault on Gaza in nearly a decade, and then tonight, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=208.64s)]
*  it has gotten bigger. Barak Ravid, as you know, is reporting thousands of Israeli soldiers have gone [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=213.44s)]
*  in, are going in over these next few hours. What can you tell us? Are they staying in? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=219.6s)]
*  Israel is expanding its ground operations. I'm not going to speculate or comment on whether this is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=225.04s)]
*  the invasion, the incursion, but it's important to understand what is coming up. The days ahead are [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=229.76s)]
*  going to be long and they're going to be difficult because we're going to go after the totality of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=234.8s)]
*  the Hamas terror and governing infrastructure inside the Gaza Strip after that jihadi group [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=238.96s)]
*  that perpetrated the October 7th massacre. And this war will end with no more Hamas in the Gaza [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=244.0s)]
*  Strip. We're going to go after every tunnel, every rocket launcher, every Hamas commander, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=248.72s)]
*  every Hamas foot soldier, and we will totally destroy the Hamas organization so they can never [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=253.2s)]
*  again hurt our civilians as they did on October 7th. If you go after every tunnel, are you willing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=257.84s)]
*  to accept the death of some of those Israeli hostages? We are demanding their immediate and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=261.92s)]
*  unconditional return. The fact that Hamas abducted 230 people is a war crime. They're not going to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=266.56s)]
*  do that. We are demanding their return and we're demanding more international pressure because, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=270.08s)]
*  you know, Hamas released four hostages under international pressure. That pressure, both from [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=273.52s)]
*  the Israeli military and diplomatic pressure, is increasing. We're calling on the whole world to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=277.91999999999996s)]
*  put more pressure on Hamas, on its commanders, on its supporters as well because we want our [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=282.32s)]
*  civilians back. There is no excuse for holding them hostage inside Gaza. If you continue this [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=286.88s)]
*  assault, obviously, the reality of it is is they may not see it that way. The reality of it is, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=292.08s)]
*  is they may say, too bad, we're going to hold your hostages. Is it true, is it fair to say, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=296.96s)]
*  that Israel has made a choice? That if you have to choose between hostages and getting rid of Hamas, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=302.0s)]
*  you have chosen to get rid of Hamas? That is completely incorrect. Israel's stated war aims [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=307.2s)]
*  are to return the hostages and to destroy the terror organization that took them, took them [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=311.6s)]
*  captive so that they can never again abduct our civilians. Those two aims, bringing back the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  hostages and destroying Hamas, go hand in hand. All right, can you tell us about the silence that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  we're seeing in Gaza tonight? Not the actual silence, the silence from a communications [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  perspective. I have nothing to add on that. Is that, is that going to change or is that just a blackout? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=328.88s)]
*  I have nothing to comment on that. Nothing to comment on that. And the other question for you is, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=332.88s)]
*  in these hours here, as Barack Reveed's reporting with, that you're going to continue to be sending [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=337.84s)]
*  more soldiers in. The other night you've gone in and you've come back out. Is there any guidance [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=341.52s)]
*  you can give us on the plan here? I'm not going to comment on operational matters, but for two weeks [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  now Israel has been urging civilians in the Gaza Strip to move south because Hamas has embedded [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  its tunnels under schools, under homes, under hospitals. Just today the IDF released intelligence [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  showing that Hamas's command bunker is underneath the Shefa Hospital, which is of course [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=361.12s)]
*  an atrocious war crime to use civilians that way as human shields. So as Israel goes in, in the days [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=365.2s)]
*  ahead, we're asking civilians to get out of the way temporarily for their safety. Do you have a [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=370.72s)]
*  plan for that hospital where there are thousands of people who are not Hamas also there? I'm not [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=374.48s)]
*  going to comment on operational matters, but we have been very clear. We are going to destroy the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=378.8s)]
*  totality of Hamas's governing and terror infrastructure inside the Gaza Strip and we [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=382.88s)]
*  are urging civilians to get out of the way for their own safety. All right, Elon, thank you very [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  much. I appreciate your time tonight. Thank you very much, Erin. Elon Levy, as I said, spokesperson [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=391.84s)]
*  for the Israeli government and out front now, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hurtling and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=396.08s)]
*  retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, both former commanding generals of U.S. Army Europe, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=400.08s)]
*  joining me now. So, General Hurtling, let me start with you. You heard what Elon said, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=404.71999999999997s)]
*  obviously not wanting to talk about operational details, but the reality of it is here is you [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=408.96s)]
*  already had the biggest round of a ground assault on Gaza in a decade this week. Tonight the counter [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  attack in Gaza is expanding. We have Barack Ravid's report that thousands of Israeli soldiers are [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=420.0s)]
*  pouring into Gaza right now and that he expects that to continue into these early hours of the [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=425.76s)]
*  morning as dawn approaches here. What do you think we're looking at? Well, we can't define it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=431.52s)]
*  uniquely, Erin. It could be one of several things. It could be an expansion of their operations, as [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=440.24s)]
*  you stated. It could be the initial stages of an assault with more forces going in, or it could be [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=447.2s)]
*  sending an additional message to Hamas saying we're tired of playing around with getting the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=454.15999999999997s)]
*  hostages back. We are going to start the operation. But from my take, truthfully having seen this kind [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=459.36s)]
*  of operation before, with the extensive amount of bombing and artillery barrages and movement of [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  forces, this seems to be the early stages of troop movements into the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=470.4s)]
*  General Hodges, on top of this, as we're keeping up live pictures of Gaza, both to emphasize the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  darkness and also so people can see when explosions do light up the sky because we do hear a lot of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=483.2s)]
*  action there along that border, a lot of sound right now. There does appear to be part of this [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=488.88s)]
*  blackout. Internet, cell, outage, General Hodges. You heard Ilan Levy refuse to comment on that, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  whether that would continue. What do you think we're looking at on that? And does that, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=503.2s)]
*  is that now going to just remain this way? Well, I think, of course, I agree with how Mark [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=509.84s)]
*  has already described things. To knock out the communications would be a logical thing to do for [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=516.8s)]
*  the Israeli Defense Force to make it difficult for Hamas to reposition, to direct their own troops in [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=523.76s)]
*  their response. This has the feeling to me of Israeli forces that are going to fill the spaces [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=531.36s)]
*  that are there. They're going to try and dominate as much of Gaza as they can as they continue to [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=540.4s)]
*  build up. And these first couple of sort of armored raids that went in, I think were intended to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=546.4s)]
*  develop intelligence, to figure out how is Hamas defending, where are their gaps, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=554.0s)]
*  where are their potential traps. And now you're seeing the mass of troops starting to come in [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=561.28s)]
*  to begin to fill the spaces. And I think to accomplish the end state that the advisor just [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=567.6s)]
*  or the spokesman just described, it's going to require time, but a lot of [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=574.88s)]
*  to be able to dominate that space. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=580.4s)]
*  General Hurtling, you commanded U.S. forces in northern Iraq. So that means, of course, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=584.72s)]
*  you were in Mosul. Is this worse? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  This is exponentially worse, Erin. There were a couple of fights in Mosul. I was involved in one [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=593.28s)]
*  of them in 2007 and eight forces from our command fought for several months, along with five [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=599.28s)]
*  divisions of Iraqi forces. This is a tough fight, and they don't compare in terms of [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=606.08s)]
*  relative enemy action. In Mosul, we had Al Qaeda in 2007 and eight. They were in the city, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=613.12s)]
*  in and out of the city, ingress and egress. They didn't have the kinds of supplies that Hamas has. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=620.32s)]
*  They didn't have the underground tunnel, extensive network. They didn't have as many citizens as are [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=625.44s)]
*  in Gaza, 2.2 million. They didn't have the two or three years to prepare for an invasion into the [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=633.68s)]
*  city of Mosul. They just went in and started fighting. So this is going to be exceedingly [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=640.64s)]
*  tough for the Israeli army, exponentially tougher than what we ever faced. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=647.12s)]
*  Sobering reality, exponentially tougher. I mean, General Hodges, how do you think Israeli forces [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=653.1999999999999s)]
*  are dealing with the tunnels in these ground assaults on Gaza? I mean, if you're flooding [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=657.76s)]
*  thousands of them in there tonight, tunnels are the absolute core of any assault. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=661.92s)]
*  What do you think is happening there? Well, I think the Israeli defense force, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=666.4s)]
*  they're probably as well equipped and trained to do this as anybody's army. They'll probably [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=671.28s)]
*  use a combination of ground penetrating radar as well as other means to identify the tunnels. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=677.36s)]
*  And then they'll be making tactical decisions about tunnels that either get, that are destroyed or are [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=684.7199999999999s)]
*  sealed off, or maybe they decide to go in some of them to find out where the network goes. But [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=690.32s)]
*  that's going to be very dangerous, obviously. But I think they know what they're up against, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=696.96s)]
*  and they probably have the right equipment and training to do this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC_IGS00cDs&t=701.36s)]
