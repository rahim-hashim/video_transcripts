# Israeli parents describe how they found out their son was kidnapped by Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA)
*  As there is breaking news tonight about two hostages being freed from Hamas by Hamas, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=0.0s)]
*  other families are watching this news tonight with hope. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=6.24s)]
*  It has been two weeks since Omer Shemtov's parents have seen their son. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  The 21-year-old was with his friends at the Nova Music Festival when Hamas attacked on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=14.36s)]
*  that day. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=19.68s)]
*  Omer was eventually handcuffed, placed in the back of a pickup truck, and kidnapped. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=20.76s)]
*  That morning was the last time that Omer's family heard his voice as he called them frantic [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=26.08s)]
*  and terrified. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  From a phone call to another phone call, he sounded much more panic, much more hysteric. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=32.92s)]
*  And even in one of the phone calls he said they are running away. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=42.36s)]
*  They came a lot of friends but they started to run so he lost some of his friends. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=46.32s)]
*  While he was running he said that they are shooting all over and he said that he even [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=52.12s)]
*  sees some dying people. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  And I love you, I love you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=60.08s)]
*  You must have been so panicked to hear your 21-year-old son telling you it's not just [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  rockets, there's gunfire and people are running and being killed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=67.08s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=71.24s)]
*  It was like we could understand from his voice that this is something that we cannot understand [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=72.24s)]
*  even what is experienced over there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=80.28s)]
*  He told me he was panicked, he was afraid. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=83.0s)]
*  He said that they got into the car and they are trying to escape from there. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  My daughter told him send us a live location. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=93.28s)]
*  He sent the live location and then the phone was stopped. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=97.84s)]
*  And then we started to see that the point is moving not in the right way. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=103.04s)]
*  Not coming home. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=111.4s)]
*  Not coming home at all. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  It's moving to the board and my daughter started to cry and she told us, listen, it's not the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=114.52000000000001s)]
*  way, it's not the way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=122.2s)]
*  I called him to say, Omer, it's not the way. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  And he didn't answer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=131.72s)]
*  The phone was ringing and he didn't answer. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=133.72s)]
*  And then we saw that he's getting into Gaza. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=139.72s)]
*  He was behind the border. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=144.72s)]
*  He was behind the border. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=146.72s)]
*  And then in the evening we got a video that was published by the Hamas that Omer is an [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=148.72s)]
*  hostage over there. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=158.4s)]
*  We saw Omer handcuffed in a bag of pickups. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  He was handcuffed in a truck? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=163.96s)]
*  Yes, with his friends. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=166.16s)]
*  They were alive. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=168.4s)]
*  There was no blood or something on his clothes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=169.4s)]
*  And that was the only signal that we got from him. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=175.68s)]
*  And it's been almost two weeks. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=182.4s)]
*  Tomorrow will have been two weeks. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=185.52s)]
*  I mean, what have these two weeks been like for both of you? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=186.88s)]
*  We are not sleeping. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=192.32s)]
*  We are not eating. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=196.6s)]
*  All of the things that we are doing now is to shout all over the world our pain that [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=201.0s)]
*  no mother in all over the world needs to feel like, mother and father needs to feel [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=216.4s)]
*  like we are feeling now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  Imagine that your son is going to a party and the next day people, murders kidnapped [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=225.52s)]
*  him. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=237.08s)]
*  And you don't know if he's eating, sleeping, if they are beating him. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=238.36s)]
*  The basic thing of a mother is to protect her son. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=247.28s)]
*  And I cannot protect my son now. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=258.04s)]
*  And it's driving me crazy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=261.24s)]
*  And I'm talking not only for myself. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=265.12s)]
*  I'm talking for a lot of families. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=271.6s)]
*  You must understand that people were in the safe place at their home. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=275.6s)]
*  They were sitting, eating breakfast. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=285.16s)]
*  Some of them were sleeping. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=287.92s)]
*  And then these terrorists came in through their house and murder and took them from [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=290.36s)]
*  their house from the place that is the most safe place. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=300.04s)]
*  And they took him babies, children, teenage mothers, fathers, grandmothers. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=305.56s)]
*  He's 21 but he's your baby. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=317.6s)]
*  What's he like? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=321.72s)]
*  What's his personality? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=322.72s)]
*  You were saying he kisses you three times on the cheeks all the time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=323.72s)]
*  He's an amazing guy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=328.32000000000005s)]
*  He's a party guy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=329.8s)]
*  He's by himself. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=331.20000000000005s)]
*  He's a DJ. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  And he likes very much all these kind of music festivals. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  So that's Homer. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  Very, very happy guy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=341.96000000000004s)]
*  Very happy guy. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  Funny. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=345.32000000000005s)]
*  We call him Sunshine because like the sunshine, everybody wants to be next to him. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=347.04s)]
*  The last time Omer's family saw him was at Shabbat dinner two weeks ago. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=359.12s)]
*  He was there like he always is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=363.92s)]
*  He's always the life of the party as they talked about. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=365.64s)]
*  His big personality. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=368.2s)]
*  And that night was the night that he went to the Nova Music Festival. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=370.28s)]
*  The next time his parents heard from him was in a series of panicked phone calls the next [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=373.92s)]
*  day when they realized that the festival he was at was being attacked by Hamas. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=377.8s)]
*  The ceremony tonight in this huge table that you see is for all the families whose loved [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=383.4s)]
*  ones are being held hostage tonight, whose loved ones won't be at Shabbat dinner tonight. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  And Omer's family is hoping that he will be back at their Shabbat dinner at their table [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=393.52s)]
*  very soon. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=399.64s)]
*  Can you show me the video that you were showing me a moment ago? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=403.96000000000004s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  And that was a picture of your family. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=431.92s)]
*  How many times have you watched that video? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=435.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=437.2s)]
*  I saw it, you know, at the beginning when Dana posted it, I saw it, I don't know, maybe [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  a hundred times. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=444.24s)]
*  And each time I'm crying and I get very emotional. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=445.24s)]
*  Even now when I see it, I get very emotional. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=449.64s)]
*  And also the songs say, you're going to get out from this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=452.66s)]
*  Don't be afraid from the fear. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=457.6s)]
*  Yes, you're going to get out from it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=459.88s)]
*  If you could talk to him right now, what would you say to him? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=462.28s)]
*  Come back, enough, enough. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  You did enough troubles. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=466.84s)]
*  Come back. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=468.35999999999996s)]
*  What about your mom? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=470.35999999999996s)]
*  That I love him, that I miss him, that I want every day when he is going, he is coming to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=472.35999999999996s)]
*  me, he's telling me, he's hugging me, telling me, mom, I love you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  He's kissing me three times and he's going. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=487.72s)]
*  So I want to hug him, to smell him. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=491.44s)]
*  That's what I want very much, to hug him and smell him. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=500.76s)]
*  And that's a relief to hear what the IDF said today, that they do believe most of the hostages [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=504.0s)]
*  are still alive. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=509.08s)]
*  For us, it's give maybe some light, but until we don't see them. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=514.2s)]
*  I want to say something about that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=524.16s)]
*  My son has asthma. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=527.8s)]
*  He cannot breathe well. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=530.2s)]
*  And I also, every day when I'm waking up and I cannot breathe, I'm taking my... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=532.32s)]
*  Yes, and I'm thinking about Omer, that he's there and he don't have his... [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=543.36s)]
*  Whatever you call it. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=553.08s)]
*  And it's the minimum thing, the humanitarian thing that they need to do, first of all. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=556.88s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=569.84s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=573.12s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=575.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=577.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=579.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=581.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=583.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=585.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=587.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=589.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=591.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=593.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=595.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=597.92s)]
*  What will you bring with you, my son? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=599.92s)]
*  I want to thank Omer's parents, Shelly and Malki. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=601.92s)]
*  They were so gracious with their time today, despite being so clearly filled with grief for their missing son. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pra0XtrEPA&t=604.92s)]
