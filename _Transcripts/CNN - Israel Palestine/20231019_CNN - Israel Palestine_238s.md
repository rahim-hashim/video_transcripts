# Dad wants the world to hear this chilling call of his daughter being kidnapped
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E)
*  It's been nearly two weeks since Hamas militants abducted dozens and dozens of hostages in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=0.0s)]
*  And their families are growing desperate. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=6.28s)]
*  More tonight from my colleague, Erin Burnett, who's in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=8.16s)]
*  Erin? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=11.16s)]
*  Abby, it has been 12 days since those hostages were abducted. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=13.36s)]
*  I mean, you have to think about what they've been enduring in that time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=17.0s)]
*  We understand maybe held in tunnels. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=20.44s)]
*  Who knows what the circumstances are? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=22.44s)]
*  And of course, their families are desperate for any sign of their loved ones. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=24.72s)]
*  They all tell us they just want a sign of life, any kind of a sign of life. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=29.2s)]
*  Earlier today, I had a chance to talk to the parents of two of the hostages, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=33.28s)]
*  Maya and Itay Regev. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=36.92s)]
*  They were both abducted by Hamas at the music festival. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=38.76s)]
*  At least 260 people were killed, of course, at that festival. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=41.88s)]
*  And their parents thought they were among them at first. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=45.56s)]
*  Their father played me a harrowing phone call from his daughter, Maya, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  as she came face to face with Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=51.84s)]
*  I can't hear this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=59.16s)]
*  Stand up, stand up! [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=89.36s)]
*  Stand up! [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=92.44s)]
*  I am a shepherd, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  stand up, God! [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=102.08s)]
*  That's not why I was born with it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=113.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=119.16s)]
*  Oh, some water, some water. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=143.82s)]
*  I thought she was dead. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=149.16s)]
*  I thought both of them dead. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=160.68s)]
*  Both of my child in the car. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=163.2s)]
*  And then she says, they killed me, they killed me. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=168.4s)]
*  I love you, Bob. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=171.44s)]
*  I love you, daddy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=172.44s)]
*  I love you, daddy. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=173.44s)]
*  Abby, obviously, it's incredible to watch that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=174.44s)]
*  You can see Marit's reaction and Alon, of course, the heartbreak. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  But they wanted the world to hear that call. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=186.04s)]
*  Alon had not listened to it since he actually spoke to his daughter. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=189.16s)]
*  Marit had not heard it until that moment. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=193.56s)]
*  And you could see her stealing herself to hear it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=196.56s)]
*  But she wanted the world to hear it because they want the world to know. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=198.6s)]
*  They also told me that they saw a video on social media, a very brief one from Hamas [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=203.08s)]
*  that showed their son taken hostage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=207.44000000000003s)]
*  And they haven't seen any video of their daughter, although they say that Israeli authorities [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=210.08s)]
*  just a few days ago told them, the Israeli army came and told them on Monday night that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  both of their children are being held in Gaza. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=219.12s)]
*  So they thought it obviously very important that the Israeli government, Abby, knew that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=221.60000000000002s)]
*  But the Israeli army refused to tell them exactly how they know this information. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=225.88000000000002s)]
*  But of course, Abby, you can see the anguish and the pain as those parents wait and wait [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=231.72s)]
*  and pray for a sign of life of their children. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW76wr0SA3E&t=235.84s)]
