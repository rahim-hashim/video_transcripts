# 'I was so shocked': Mom who broke down on DNC stage speaks out
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go)
*  One of the most moving moments of the DNC unfolded last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=0.0s)]
*  It was not the stirring speech of a gifted politician, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=3.36s)]
*  but the heartbroken words of this man's parents. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  23-year-old Hirsch Goldberg, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=9.68s)]
*  Poland is an Israeli-American hostage held by Hamas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=11.56s)]
*  He is one of eight Americans still held nearly 11 months. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=15.16s)]
*  That's right, 11 months after the terror attacks on Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=18.72s)]
*  Last night, they took to the stage wearing the number 320 [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=22.52s)]
*  for the number of days he's been held prisoner. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=25.36s)]
*  In an inflamed Middle East, we know the one thing [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=29.56s)]
*  that can most immediately release pressure [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=33.76s)]
*  and bring calm to the entire region, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=37.44s)]
*  a deal that brings this diverse group of 109 hostages home [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=40.64s)]
*  and ends the suffering of the innocent civilians in Gaza. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=47.2s)]
*  Free them all! Free them all! [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=51.2s)]
*  Free them all! Free them all! [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=54.2s)]
*  Free them all! Free them all! [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=57.2s)]
*  Free them all! [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=60.2s)]
*  Such an incredible moment. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  And John and Rachel Goldberg, Poland, join me now. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=65.04s)]
*  Rachel, we should note you're both wearing 321. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=67.80000000000001s)]
*  You were wearing 320 last night. It's now 321 days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  We change it every day. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And what did that moment mean to you last night? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=74.88s)]
*  I was so shocked and overwhelmed [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=79.52s)]
*  because we had been told to anticipate [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=83.52s)]
*  a neutral to negative reception. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=87.52s)]
*  And when we walked out and suddenly there were thousands of people [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=92.52s)]
*  who got to their feet and started to chant, bring them home, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=99.52s)]
*  we were just swelled with support [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=104.52s)]
*  and it was overwhelming and I just started to weep. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=109.52s)]
*  Yeah. I think a lot of people were. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=114.52s)]
*  John, how did that resonate with you, seeing that? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=117.52s)]
*  I know this week what we've been hearing is obviously there are protests here, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=124.52s)]
*  there's a lot of deep opposition to the war in Gaza, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  but there's still in the hearts of a lot of folks in this country [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=132.52s)]
*  just pain and agony for what you're going through. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=137.52s)]
*  It's so easy to politicize everything [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=140.52s)]
*  and that's the danger and that's what's been happening. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=143.52s)]
*  But it was heartening last night to see that even before we spoke a word, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=146.52s)]
*  I think people understood that there's a human side to this story. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=151.52s)]
*  It's not just an issue. It's not just numbers and ambiguity. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=155.52s)]
*  These are 109 real human beings with loved ones, with families waiting for them, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=160.52s)]
*  their innocence on all sides in the Middle East conflict who are suffering. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=166.52s)]
*  And I think the people in the room understood that last night. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=170.52s)]
*  That was so important. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=173.52s)]
*  And you've emphasized the diversity of the hostages. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=175.52s)]
*  Right. Well, I think that there's a real misunderstanding [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=179.52s)]
*  of who this hostage cohort is, that this is a monolithic group of people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=182.52s)]
*  And as I mentioned last night, they are from 23 different countries. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=188.52s)]
*  They are Christian. They are Jewish. They're Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=193.52s)]
*  And this is something that gets lost when someone has a very specific reason [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=198.52s)]
*  to create a narrative a certain way. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=204.52s)]
*  And we also very much are constantly saying we are extremely concerned [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=206.52s)]
*  and heartbroken for the innocent civilians in Gaza [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=213.52s)]
*  and the innocent civilians in Gaza who were dragged there on October 7th. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=217.52s)]
*  You don't have to choose one or the other. This is a humanitarian issue. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=221.52s)]
*  Absolutely. And everybody's feeling it. Everybody's feeling it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=227.52s)]
*  And John, Hirsch lost part of his left arm in the attacks. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=232.52s)]
*  Do we know of any idea how he's doing, how he's holding up? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=237.52s)]
*  120 days ago, we saw a video that Hamas released of Hirsch. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=242.52s)]
*  It was the first sign of life we had on him in 201 days [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=247.52s)]
*  and the last sign that we've had since. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=251.52s)]
*  But that video is something that no parent would ever want to see of their kid [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=253.52s)]
*  with a limb missing, bruising on their face, looking pale. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=257.52s)]
*  But at the same time, when that's what you get after 201 days, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=262.52s)]
*  it just gave us strength to see him, to hear him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=266.52s)]
*  And it continues to carry us now that he's a fighter and a survivor [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=269.52s)]
*  and he's going to keep on going. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=274.52s)]
*  And we need him to know and all the hostages to know [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=276.52s)]
*  that we are not stopping until we get them all out. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=278.52s)]
*  And Rachel, I know I was asking this during the commercial break, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=281.52s)]
*  but do you have any sense, I mean, there are these talks that are going on right now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=285.52s)]
*  Do you have any sense as to where they're going? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=288.52s)]
*  Are they finally going to get to some kind of resolution [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=291.52s)]
*  so we can bring your son and the rest of those hostages home? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=293.52s)]
*  Well, we're not any more privy to what is going on behind the scenes [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=297.52s)]
*  than any regular person watching the news or following. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=302.52s)]
*  We are always hopeful and optimistic. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=306.52s)]
*  We know that many of the people who are participating in the negotiations [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=309.52s)]
*  and in everything that's happening are really trying to lean forward. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=316.52s)]
*  At the end of the day, this is up to two men from the two primary parties, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=321.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=329.52s)]
*  And I think until each of them decide that it's time for our children, our loved ones, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=334.52s)]
*  the whole entire mass of people who are caught in the crosshairs of this conflict, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=344.52s)]
*  no longer should be pawns in this game. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=350.52s)]
*  It won't end. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=353.52s)]
*  And it's so important, and I do want to go back to that moment last night, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=356.52s)]
*  that people understand the human element of this. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=360.52s)]
*  They're real families suffering, real families in the dark. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=365.52s)]
*  And to have that outpouring of support, it just must have meant so much. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=370.52s)]
*  It's still there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=374.52s)]
*  Fight everything that's in the political spectrum right now, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=376.52s)]
*  the dialogue that's happening, and so much bitter opposition to what's taking place. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=380.52s)]
*  It's still there. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=384.52s)]
*  I mentioned in my remarks last night that really one of the things that has carried [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=386.52s)]
*  all the hostage families to get up every morning and keep on pushing and keep fighting [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=390.52s)]
*  is the tremendous support, strength, prayers we get from literally all over the world. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=395.52s)]
*  And last night was a microcosm of it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=401.52s)]
*  I don't know, 20, 25,000 people in the building. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=403.52s)]
*  Not only were they supporting us as we spoke, but afterwards, just people stopping us. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=406.52s)]
*  And as we walked out, shouting, we're with you, we're supporting you, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=412.52s)]
*  our prayers are with you, keep going. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=415.52s)]
*  It was really opening. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=418.52s)]
*  None of the reaction that you were prepared for that they told you you might receive. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=419.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=423.52s)]
*  It's so important. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=425.52s)]
*  And I'm sure it sustains you to some extent. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=427.52s)]
*  It doesn't do everything. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=431.52s)]
*  But it's obviously helpful, and I think it is really important. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=433.52s)]
*  We don't all have to agree, and that was a big theme last night [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=439.52s)]
*  that a lot of the different speakers discussed, but we have to try to understand. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=443.52s)]
*  We don't have to agree. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=450.52s)]
*  We just have to try to understand those with whom we don't share the same opinions. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=451.52s)]
*  That's all right. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=458.52s)]
*  We have to try to understand each other. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=459.52s)]
*  Yeah, there was a lot of talk about looking out for your neighbors, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=461.52s)]
*  and that crosses boundaries, nations. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=464.52s)]
*  We honestly did not even know that we were speaking on the night that was under the freedom theme. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=468.52s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=474.52s)]
*  But it makes sense. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=475.52s)]
*  That's what we're pushing for. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=478.52s)]
*  That's what we've been pushing for 321 days and are going to continue to fight for it. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=480.52s)]
*  Well, thank you very much to both of you. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=485.52s)]
*  I know we say it time and again, but we are thinking of you and praying for you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=487.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=493.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=494.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=495.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=496.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=497.52s)]
*  Rachel and John, thanks so much. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzLBHU9S-go&t=498.52s)]
