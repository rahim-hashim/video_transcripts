# 'Who takes over?': Tapper presses Netanyahu adviser on the future of Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A)
*  The senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Ambassador [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=0.0s)]
*  to the United Kingdom, Mark Regev, is with us now in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=5.04s)]
*  First of all, let me just ask you, I know military people, I guess, in Israel, not just [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=9.56s)]
*  the United States, have their own language. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  When the IDF says military, the ground excursion has expanded, ground operations have expanded, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=15.6s)]
*  I didn't know that even begun. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=22.32s)]
*  So what does this mean exactly that the ground operation has expanded? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=23.96s)]
*  Does it mean that Israeli troops, soldiers are on the ground in Gaza? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=27.64s)]
*  So obviously I'm not going to go into anything operational, especially if such an operation [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=32.96s)]
*  is ongoing for obvious reasons. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=37.16s)]
*  But I can say this, we are beefing up the pressure on Hamas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=40.6s)]
*  That pressure will increase and continue to increase until we achieve our goal. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=44.64s)]
*  But is there a ground, I mean, ground operations have expanded, does that mean ground operations [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=49.46s)]
*  are happening? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=53.8s)]
*  That's what it sounds like it means. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=54.8s)]
*  Again, I don't speak militaryese, whether it's in the Pentagon or the IDF, but what [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=56.44s)]
*  does it mean? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=62.32s)]
*  I said a moment ago, operations are ongoing. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=63.32s)]
*  Right, okay, I still don't know what that means. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=65.88s)]
*  What can you tell us about this barrage of airstrikes going on in Gaza right now? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=68.44s)]
*  I can't go into anything tactical, but I can say this, we are focused on our goal, which [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=73.0s)]
*  is the elimination of Hamas, which is the destruction of its military capabilities, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=79.84s)]
*  its military machine, and the end of its political control over the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=85.8s)]
*  So the IDF released earlier today a 3D map of a command and control center of Hamas that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=91.08s)]
*  the IDF says is under a hospital in Gaza. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=101.44s)]
*  It's not photographs, it's a graphics, a graphic depiction. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=105.88s)]
*  Where does that information come from? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=110.36s)]
*  That information is ironclad. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=111.84s)]
*  It's based on Israeli intelligence, but if you ask Gazans who are honest with you, they'll [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=114.94s)]
*  tell you that for years they've known that Hamas uses hospitals, particularly in this [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=120.34s)]
*  case, the Shefa Hospital, but not only, for their command and control. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=125.62s)]
*  The IDF spokesman said, and people in Gaza must have seen it, that when this war started [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=129.78s)]
*  on the 7th of October with that terrible massacre and they expected Israel to strike back, there [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=135.3s)]
*  of Hamas activists, Hamas terrorists, scores of them finding shelter in the Shefa Hospital. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=141.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=147.02s)]
*  So, I mean, obviously it has been known and has been reported by, I mean, Anderson's been [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=148.02s)]
*  to Gaza and it's known that Hamas fires rockets from civilian centers, from apartments, etc. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=154.26s)]
*  From schools, from UN facilities? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=163.66s)]
*  Right, it's been reported by, it's not just IDF claiming it, it's been reported by Independent [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=165.5s)]
*  journalists on the ground. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=170.06s)]
*  Does that mean that Israel considers hospitals to be legitimate targets? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=171.78s)]
*  Because there are also, as you will acknowledge, patients and doctors and nurses in those hospitals. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=175.38s)]
*  So we were just pointing out the facts. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  We want the world to understand the enemy we're up against. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=185.7s)]
*  A ruthless enemy that has been reported widely on CNN has no trouble massacring Israeli civilians. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=188.9s)]
*  They did so in all the gruesome reality that we saw on October 7th. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=195.26s)]
*  But they also have no qualms whatsoever about embedding themselves in humanitarian buildings [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=200.5s)]
*  like hospitals, which is, I think it shows us exactly who we're up against. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=206.01999999999998s)]
*  And when this is over and we have defeated Hamas and we have destroyed its military machine [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=211.0s)]
*  and we have removed it from the position of power it holds in Gaza today, I think not [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  only are we doing Israelis a favor in freeing them from this terrorist threat to the south, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=219.94s)]
*  but we're ultimately doing the people of Gaza a favor. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=224.66s)]
*  We're freeing them from this extremist theocratic dictatorship run by a bunch of cutthroat terrorists. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  Who takes over in Gaza when and if you actually defeat Hamas? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=233.92s)]
*  Who takes over? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=238.68s)]
*  First of all, we will defeat Hamas. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=239.68s)]
*  We will eliminate them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=240.68s)]
*  But who takes over? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=241.68s)]
*  That we have contingency plans. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=243.38s)]
*  We're looking at different scenarios. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=245.01999999999998s)]
*  We've been discussing them also with friends and allies like with Washington. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=247.42s)]
*  But at this stage, I can't go into any details. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=250.38s)]
*  The focus at the moment is defeating Hamas. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=252.78s)]
*  And practically anything is superior, is preferable to continue Hamas rule in Gaza because we've [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=255.8s)]
*  seen what that brings. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=262.6s)]
*  It brings the sort of massacre that we saw in Israel on October 7th. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=263.9s)]
*  We don't want to go back there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=267.32s)]
*  A senior Hamas official says Hamas is, quote, ready to defeat Israeli ground troops if they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=268.9s)]
*  enter Gaza. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=273.32s)]
*  He went on to say, quote, the resistance, this is just me quoting them, the resistance [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=274.32s)]
*  is ready. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=278.44s)]
*  I mean, I laid out what your soldiers are going to be facing in Gaza. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=279.86s)]
*  It is, the challenge is, this vast network of, what is it, 200 kilometers of tunnels [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=286.62s)]
*  that they've been building for 20 years, you know, very sophisticated. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=293.56s)]
*  The defense minister said to me earlier today, all the money going to Gaza over the years, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  not to build universities, not to build factories, to build tunnels and to buy rockets. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=307.6s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=311.16s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=312.16s)]
*  A ruthless terrorist group. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=313.16s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=315.36s)]
*  Willing to blow themselves up, willing to do anything, use their own people as human [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=316.36s)]
*  camouflage. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=321.16s)]
*  At urban warfare, the toughest warfare there is, two million civilians that you don't want [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=322.16s)]
*  to kill, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=328.88s)]
*  You don't want to hurt them. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=330.06s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=331.06s)]
*  You're unfortunately killing them, but you don't want to. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=332.06s)]
*  Making an effort not to. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=334.22s)]
*  You're making an effort not to, but you're killing a lot of them. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is a task that it's seemingly impossible and you're sending your soldiers [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=339.34000000000003s)]
*  into it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  So, obviously- [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  On top of a humanitarian crisis already ongoing. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=347.46000000000004s)]
*  First of all, the entire situation we're in is precisely because Hamas attacked us and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=349.86s)]
*  massacred us on October 7th. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=355.54s)]
*  We are responding to Hamas. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=356.98s)]
*  And I have no doubt that our soldiers who are going into battle are facing risks. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=359.18s)]
*  You're 100% correct. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=363.5s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=364.78s)]
*  The enemy is horrific in its barbarity, in its fanaticism, and its disregard for all [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=365.78s)]
*  the normal rules of war. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=371.7s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=373.98s)]
*  But we have to do this. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=374.98s)]
*  And the young soldiers going into battle know this, that we have to do this. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=376.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=380.1s)]
*  The current status quo, that we've got this terrorist ISIS-type enclave on our southern [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=381.1s)]
*  border, that is unsustainable. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=385.58s)]
*  We will not live like that any longer. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=388.06s)]
*  We saw what they're capable of doing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=390.18s)]
*  We saw the sort of gruesome, terrible, horrific violence they inflicted upon us. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=392.26s)]
*  We refuse to live with that sort of neighbor anymore. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=397.09999999999997s)]
*  And we are now going to create a new reality in Gaza. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=400.46s)]
*  Reality that will be hopefully more stable, more peaceful, will be better for people on [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=404.7s)]
*  both sides of the frontier. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ijJkr_d_A&t=408.3s)]
