# Israel says video shows strike that killed Hamas military leader
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0)
*  Thousands marched in Tehran to remember slain Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=0.0s)]
*  as the Middle East region remains on edge. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=5.68s)]
*  Iran observing three days of mourning for Haniyeh and his bodyguard, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=9.44s)]
*  who were killed in a pre-dawn strike on Wednesday in the Iranian capital. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=13.32s)]
*  Iran and its allies are vowing retaliation against Israel, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=18.92s)]
*  which is neither confirmed nor denied being involved. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=24.12s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the nation on Wednesday, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  saying Israel had delivered crushing blows to its enemies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=33.28s)]
*  He said Israel would not give in to calls to end the war in Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=37.48s)]
*  Well, separately, Israel is confirming that its fighter jets killed Hamas' military chief, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=42.72s)]
*  Mohammed Deif, in a strike in Gaza in mid-July. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=49.04s)]
*  The IDF released this video. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=53.68s)]
*  At least 90 Palestinians were also killed in that attack. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=56.04s)]
*  Right, we've got CNN reporters standing by with the very latest. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=61.44s)]
*  Ivan Watson is in Beirut. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=64.68s)]
*  Let's, though, begin with Jeremy Diamond, who is today in Haifa in Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=66.24s)]
*  And Jeremy, Israel confirming the death of the Hamas military chief. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=71.2s)]
*  This is hugely significant, not least on the same day [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=76.2s)]
*  that we are witnessing funerals of two other Israeli enemies, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=81.92s)]
*  one confirmed killed by Israel, the other dead in Tehran, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  likely at the hands of the Israelis. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=93.44s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=95.56s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt about it, Becky. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=99.44s)]
*  I mean, the images that we are seeing today of that memorial service for Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=100.64s)]
*  the funeral that will happen today in Beirut for Fuad Shoker, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=106.52s)]
*  the Hezbollah senior military commander, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  and then now the Israeli military confirming that that strike nearly three weeks ago [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  on the targeted Mohammed Deif, Hamas's military commander, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=118.72s)]
*  all of those coming on the same day just paints a really powerful picture [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=125.4s)]
*  of what the Israeli military and perhaps its intelligence services [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=130.12s)]
*  have been able to accomplish from their standpoint over the course of just the last few weeks. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=134.48000000000002s)]
*  These are, as the Israeli prime minister described, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=139.56s)]
*  some quite crushing blows to Israel's enemies. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=142.84s)]
*  And obviously, the Israeli prime minister and the military want to paint this picture of victory [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=147.16s)]
*  at a time when they don't have a ceasefire deal. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=152.76s)]
*  They haven't gotten the hostages out. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=155.52s)]
*  And the Israeli prime minister obviously looking for victories, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=158.16s)]
*  which explains the speech that he gave yesterday. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=161.72s)]
*  But there is also just a very real reality of these military accomplishments on the ground [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=164.32s)]
*  and the extent to which it obviously delivers not just a picture of victory, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=170.76s)]
*  but some quite significant achievements for the Israeli military and its government. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=175.32s)]
*  What it also does, of course, is significantly raise the temperature in a region [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=180.12s)]
*  that is already very much on edge. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=183.88s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister acknowledging that himself in his remarks last night, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  saying that these are challenging days and that Israel is prepared for all scenarios. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=191.72s)]
*  At this stage, there are no changes yet in the Home Front Command guidance, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=196.52s)]
*  which is issued to civilians to let them know whether to increase their state of alert, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  their state of readiness for the potential for military action. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=204.24s)]
*  But there's no question that we have seen reporting from The New York Times, for example, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=209.08s)]
*  that Iran intends to strike back at Israel directly for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=212.88s)]
*  in the Iranian capital. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=219.32s)]
*  And there is clearly a heightened state of readiness, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=221.28s)]
*  a heightened state of alertness from the Israeli military itself as we wait to see [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  whether or not this very combustible region will in fact combust in quite extraordinary fashion perhaps. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=230.96s)]
*  Well, let's get our viewers some images then of what we have been witnessing in Tehran, in Iran today. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=237.68s)]
*  Ivan Watson, who is in Beirut monitoring the situation there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=244.12s)]
*  What are we seeing? Just explain what's going on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=249.8s)]
*  The Iranians have been showing the highest kind of respect for Ismail Haniyeh, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=255.88000000000002s)]
*  the political chief of Hamas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=262.44s)]
*  And there's been a funeral procession from Tehran University to Tehran's Azadi Square, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=265.92s)]
*  prayers led by the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=273.40000000000003s)]
*  We've seen images released of several of Haniyeh's surviving sons, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=278.56s)]
*  two of his surviving sons embracing his coffin mourning. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  He, it's expected, will be transferred, his remains, from Tehran to Doha, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=288.68s)]
*  where he has been based for years now as a guest of the Qatari government for his ultimate funeral. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  I mention the sons in part because Haniyeh, two of his sons and several of his grandchildren [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza several months back. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=307.8s)]
*  The Iranian government vowing retribution and revenge for the assassination of Haniyeh. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=312.48s)]
*  We still don't have a lot of details about how this was carried out overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=318.48s)]
*  And, of course, Israel has not claimed responsibility for it, but all fingers are pointing towards Israel for this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=324.48s)]
*  And Iran has also been pointing the finger at the U.S., [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=330.6s)]
*  arguing that the U.S. is Israel's most important patron, supplier of weapons and funding, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=333.56s)]
*  and claiming that Israel could not have done this without U.S. support. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  The line that has been coming out of the Biden administration, out of its top diplomat, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=345.12s)]
*  Antony Blinken, has been a warning of the threat of war in the region and saying that a ceasefire is more important now than ever. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  In Gaza, that's ringing on somewhat deaf ears with the prime minister of Qatar, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  which has been a chief mediator in the months of talks between Israel and Hamas aiming at a return of the hostages. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=365.16s)]
*  Qatar saying, how do you have negotiations when the partner at the negotiating table, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=374.04s)]
*  Ismail Haniyeh, has just been assassinated? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=379.56s)]
*  So real questions about the future of any attempt at a negotiated settlement here. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=383.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, I'll point to here in Beirut some diplomacy underway. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=388.92s)]
*  The defense and foreign secretaries of the U.K. are currently here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=392.88s)]
*  They've been meeting with Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, also importantly, with the speaker of parliament, Nabi Berri. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=397.48s)]
*  He's a Shiite Muslim politician, leader of the Amal movement and seen as an interlocutor with Hezbollah. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=405.2s)]
*  And the British officials have been trying to also push diplomacy at this time of extreme tension in the region. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=413.48s)]
*  Nabi Berri saying that, quote, Lebanon doesn't want war, but is prepared to defend itself. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=421.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, we're waiting for the beginning of a funeral for Fouad Shakir. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=427.12s)]
*  That's that senior Hezbollah official who was assassinated on Tuesday evening here in the southern suburbs of Beirut [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=432.28s)]
*  by an Israeli airstrike that also killed at least five other people, including two children and two women. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=440.48s)]
*  We're anticipating a speech from the head of Hezbollah, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=447.24s)]
*  of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, to try to gain some insight about what the Iran and its allies in the region may do in response to these assassinations. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=452.4s)]
*  So we're waiting to hear what kind of messaging they will want to send as there are vows of vengeance coming from Tehran. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=463.96s)]
*  Becky, it's good to have you both. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=471.44s)]
*  And again, let's just perhaps underscore the importance of what we are seeing today. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=474.64s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister describing a position of strength in suggesting that Israel is getting rid of its enemies. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=482.12s)]
*  We see the split screen of these two funerals, one in Tehran and one, of course, in Beirut. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=492.4s)]
*  And that is what we are looking at here, the funeral of the Hezbollah senior leader killed by Israel, assassinated by Israel over the weekend. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=499.59999999999997s)]
*  And on the day that we get the announcement from the Israelis that Mohammed Daif has been assassinated, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  the leader of the military wing of Hamas. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q58wUEiokr0&t=514.8s)]
