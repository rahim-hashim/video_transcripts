# CNN asks Hamas official why group hasn't agreed to US-backed ceasefire proposal
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII)
*  Since the 7th of October last year when Hamas militants streamed into Israel, killing hundreds [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=0.0s)]
*  and grabbing hostages, the war in Gaza has been an unrelenting nightmare of death and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=7.76s)]
*  destruction. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=14.64s)]
*  Talks to end the war are once again bogged down, as every day the death toll mounts. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=15.64s)]
*  In Beirut, we spoke to senior Hamas leader Osama Hamdan, one of the few privy to details [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=23.18s)]
*  of the ceasefire negotiations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=29.0s)]
*  But not privy, he claims, to the condition of the 120 hostages still in Gaza. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=31.9s)]
*  How many of those 120 are still alive? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=38.24s)]
*  I don't have any idea about that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=42.56s)]
*  No one has any idea about this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal recently reported that messages from Gaza Hamas leader Yahya [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=47.16s)]
*  Sinwar to mediators and other Hamas officials included one in which he allegedly said the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=52.120000000000005s)]
*  deaths of civilians in Gaza is a necessary sacrifice. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=58.48s)]
*  Hamdan insists the messages were fake. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=63.12s)]
*  After eight months of this war, more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed, probably [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=67.6s)]
*  more, more than 80,000 injured. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=73.39999999999999s)]
*  Was it a necessary sacrifice for the people of Gaza? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  You seem that you can't start from the beginning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  Let's start from page number one. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=86.16s)]
*  I would like to talk about the page of the 7th of October. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=87.64s)]
*  What about the Israeli occupation for the Palestinians? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm talking about what came after the 7th of October. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  The 7th of October was a reaction against the occupation. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  What comes after that, it shows the real face of Israel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=100.2s)]
*  It shows how Israel is occupying the Palestinian lands, demolishing the situation of the Palestinians, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=104.2s)]
*  killing the civilians. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=110.0s)]
*  It's not the first time they are killing the civilians. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=111.0s)]
*  Hamas is an organization. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Does it regret what it did on the 7th of October given what happened afterwards? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=115.16s)]
*  We are living with this for the last 75 years as Palestinians. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=120.0s)]
*  CNN spoke to one of the doctors who treated the four Israelis who were freed on Saturday. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=123.96s)]
*  He said that they suffered mental and physical abuse. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=132.12s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=136.16s)]
*  He is an Israeli. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  He has to say what the Israeli authorities are asking him to say. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  If you compare the images of both before and after releasing, you will find that they were [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=144.24s)]
*  better than before. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=150.36s)]
*  I believe if they have mental problem, this is because of what Israel have done in Gaza. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=151.56s)]
*  But in addition to what has been said about the four recent hostages freed, there have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=157.68s)]
*  also been claims about the dire conditions others faced while in captivity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=162.44s)]
*  The fate of the remaining hostages hangs in the balance. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  At the G7 summit in Italy, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was hoping [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=172.36s)]
*  Hamas would agree to the latest U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=178.44s)]
*  Response we got was unfortunately not the yes that we were looking for, a yes that virtually [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=184.32s)]
*  the entire world has given. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=188.4s)]
*  Mr. Hamdan, simple question. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  Why hasn't Hamas yet agreed officially to the U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  We said it's a positive step. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=200.92s)]
*  But we need to see the facts on the ground. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=203.68s)]
*  We need to know what exactly the president means by saying a ceasefire with withdrawal. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=205.76s)]
*  What is left? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=214.56s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=215.92s)]
*  We need an Israeli, a clear position from Israel to accept the ceasefire, a complete [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=218.29999999999998s)]
*  withdrawal from Gaza, and let the Palestinians to determine their future by themselves. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=224.82s)]
*  Are you optimistic at this point in time that you will reach some sort of agreement? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=231.14s)]
*  I think if the United States administration acted in the positive way, seeing the situation [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=237.42s)]
*  not only in the eyes of Israel, we can reach soon an agreement. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=242.18s)]
*  And in the absence of an agreement, this war goes on with no end in sight. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImBFUfwWgII&t=248.94s)]
