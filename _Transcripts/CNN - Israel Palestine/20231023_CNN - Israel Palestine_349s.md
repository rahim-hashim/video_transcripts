# Sources say 2 more hostages released by Hamas
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk)
*  We are beginning with breaking news in the Israel Hamas war sources telling CNN [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=0.0s)]
*  that the terror group Hamas has released two more hostages who are believed to be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=5.4s)]
*  Israeli citizens. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=9.88s)]
*  Anderson. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Yes, you know, two Americans were released last week. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=13.24s)]
*  Sources also saying that today's release is happening with the help of officials [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  from Qatar who are involved in the other release as well as well as Egypt this time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=19.64s)]
*  CNN Chief National Security correspondent Alex Marquardt joins us with some of the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=24.68s)]
*  details along with CNN anchor Kaitlin Collins. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=27.8s)]
*  Kaitlin, let's start with you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=29.76s)]
*  What exactly do we know? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=30.96s)]
*  Obviously, we have some information that we are not giving out until all of this [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=32.32s)]
*  is confirmed because this is still a very fluid situation. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=36.0s)]
*  They are not in Israel, is my understanding. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=39.52s)]
*  Right. It's an incredibly fluid situation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=41.52s)]
*  And so we are holding off on some of the details while we run those down because [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=43.68s)]
*  this is a very sensitive situation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=46.88s)]
*  We want to make sure we get everything completely right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  But what we do know is that two more hostages have been released by Hamas. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=50.92s)]
*  We are told I'm told that they're not actually in the custody of the Israeli [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=55.2s)]
*  government yet, but that they are on the way there right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=59.2s)]
*  And so that is part of the sensitivity around this reporting about these hostages, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=61.64s)]
*  obviously, given their situation. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=66.0s)]
*  But this is significant. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=68.28s)]
*  I am told that they are both two female hostages that have been released. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=69.36s)]
*  They, of course, would be only the third and the fourth hostages in total [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=73.44s)]
*  to be released of the hundreds that we do believe, according to the IDF, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=76.92s)]
*  that Hamas has in their custody at this moment. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  And so what we are still trying to figure out, Anderson, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=83.48s)]
*  is whether or not they are dual citizens. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=85.8s)]
*  We do know they are Israeli citizens, but maybe they have dual nationalities, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=87.76s)]
*  as we've seen with a lot of these hostages and the people who were abducted by Hamas. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=91.36s)]
*  So those are details that we are still trying to figure out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=95.44s)]
*  But it does appear that this came about from some quiet mediation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=97.92s)]
*  that was happening behind the scenes with the Egyptian and Qatari governments. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=101.48s)]
*  They've been obviously playing a really significant role in trying to get these [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=105.36s)]
*  hostages released because Israel has made very clear from all officials [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=108.84s)]
*  that they are not personally negotiating with Hamas for the release of these hostages. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=113.0s)]
*  And I do think this is a big part of what we are seeing here [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=118.08s)]
*  when it comes to the timing of what everyone is waiting to happen next in Gaza, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=120.52s)]
*  which is that Israeli ground invasion that we know officials have said [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=124.4s)]
*  and telegraphed quite clearly is expected to come. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=128.0s)]
*  There have been discussions with US officials, with other government officials, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=130.96s)]
*  about holding off on that until more of these negotiations for these hostages [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=134.24s)]
*  can happen. And so right now, what we are working to confirm [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=138.76s)]
*  is the identities of these two hostages, where exactly they are now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=141.56s)]
*  And once they get into the custody of the IDF, which Anderson, as you know, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=145.36s)]
*  is what happened with those two hostages last week, they came to the Gaza border. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=149.8s)]
*  They were then given over to the IDF, who brought them to a military base [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=153.6s)]
*  first in central Israel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  That's where they greeted their parents before and having those medical checkups [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=159.24s)]
*  and obviously kind of debriefings of what they've been going through. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And Alex, there's usually this interim step there. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=167.24s)]
*  They are handed, usually Hamas, wherever is holding them, hands them over [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=169.52s)]
*  to the representatives of the international community, the Red Cross. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=173.36s)]
*  And then they make that transfer to to IDF officials. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=176.96s)]
*  These are two. There were two. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=181.4s)]
*  There were nonce who we talked about last week. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=183.64000000000001s)]
*  Let's talk about the timing of this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=186.72s)]
*  Clearly, Hamas has many captives in their custody. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=188.72s)]
*  They could release all of them if they wanted to. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  They are releasing them two by two. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=197.28s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=199.28s)]
*  Well, it's certainly good news. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=200.88s)]
*  No one's going to tell you otherwise, Anderson. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=202.48s)]
*  This is fantastic for those families, as well as for the nonce [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=204.32s)]
*  who saw two of their family members come back on Friday. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=208.16s)]
*  But no doubt, Anderson, whether it's the US or Israel or Qatar, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=210.4s)]
*  which is leading these negotiations along with Egypt, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=214.48s)]
*  they would like to see much bigger numbers. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=216.68s)]
*  I mean, we heard from the IDF earlier today that there are some 222 [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=218.52s)]
*  hostages who are in custody. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=222.8s)]
*  So we certainly don't want to to to to see, you know, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  these hostages coming out two by two. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=229.16s)]
*  The the the Qataris are now pushing for much bigger numbers, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=232.0s)]
*  say dozens or scores of the civilians of the foreigners who are still in custody. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=235.96s)]
*  In terms of the mechanics, Anderson, you know, obviously, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  Hamas is not going to come face to face with Israeli officials [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=245.32s)]
*  as they hand over prisoners. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  So you have the UN, which operates independently inside Gaza. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=250.72s)]
*  You have the Red Cross, which operates fairly independently inside Gaza. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=253.68s)]
*  And so what has happened today, we understand, as as like it did on Friday, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=257.2s)]
*  the same mechanism of Hamas handing these two captives over to the Red Cross. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=260.56s)]
*  They will then be taken to somewhere along the border. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  We don't know where there are two formal large border crossings in southern Gaza. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=268.12s)]
*  One goes into Egypt, one goes into Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  But frankly, there are there are a number of places all along that fence line [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  where you are seeing today all of those Israeli troops [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  where the Red Cross could then hand those two Israeli women over to the IDF. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=283.72s)]
*  As Caitlin mentioned, they would then likely be taken to a military base. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=288.04s)]
*  They would get checked up to make sure that they're OK. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=291.32s)]
*  Hamas has claimed that the previous release was for humanitarian reasons. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=293.88s)]
*  It's not clear what shape the women are are are in. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=298.2s)]
*  But we do understand from the White House today that the U.S. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=302.48s)]
*  that U.S. officials have debriefed or are going to debrief [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=305.76s)]
*  the two Americans to gather intelligence, to get a sense of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=309.16s)]
*  where they were held, how they were held and any other kind of information [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  that they could glean from those two women. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=315.47999999999996s)]
*  But Anderson, certainly the bottom line here is that everyone wants to see [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=317.96s)]
*  a lot more hostages being released. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  And that is why there is this pressure on the Israeli government [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=324.76s)]
*  to delay their incursion into Gaza. Anderson. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=327.36s)]
*  Yeah, and the International Committee of the Red Cross has repeatedly [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=330.68s)]
*  requested access to all the hostages who remain in Gaza. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=333.68s)]
*  They have not been allowed access. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  They've also requested proof of life. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=339.32s)]
*  Last we heard they had not received any of that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=341.68s)]
*  from from those holding them, Islamic Jihad or Hamas. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S-CE_zE5wk&t=345.0s)]
