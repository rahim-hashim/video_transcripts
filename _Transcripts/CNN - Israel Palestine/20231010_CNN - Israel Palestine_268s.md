**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY)
*  Most questions about hostages remain it appears preparations for a ground offensive in Gaza are underway [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's take a closer look at Gus with retired US Army Major Mike Lyons major lines appreciate you being here to start [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  You know we hear constantly about just how? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Tight it is in Gaza for lack of a better term about two million people an area about the size of Chicago [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=15.44s)]
*  What complications does that bring for any type of ground offensive? Yeah, I mean tremendous [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=20.900000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna potentially see casualties and civilian casualties like we haven't seen since the Second World War just based on what Israel has said [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=25.32s)]
*  They've declared war here. They've said use the word like siege siege from military perspective means flatten [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=32.44s)]
*  It means we're going to surround choke off, you know the supply of gold goes out here [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=37.92s)]
*  but I want to talk a little bit about that courageous CNN crew because they're sitting right here in Kaffir as I was I here and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=42.36s)]
*  And they're so close to that Gaza border here [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=47.28s)]
*  And what the what there's under is missile fires coming from on the other side [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=49.8s)]
*  They still have capacity Hamas is still firing rockets inside of Israel. And so though the air [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=54.16s)]
*  Frames you hear are Israel forces on kind of station ready to go ready to knock them out [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  But again, it just shows me they still have capacity. They've not stopped with regard to attacking Israel [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=65.08s)]
*  What are the biggest challenges for Israeli forces if we do see the ground incursion? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=71.0s)]
*  I think Nick made a very good point because he's had years of experience covering the region that in his estimation they [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=75.08s)]
*  They are not amassed enough at this point for an imminent incursion that that's that's his read on the ground [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=81.6s)]
*  But whenever it may happen if it does what are the challenges they face once they get into Gaza? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, it's gonna take them a while to wound up as as been part of an out large offensive operation [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=92.28s)]
*  The past it's gonna take days in order of 300,000 reservists have been mobilized and then once they go in [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=97.92s)]
*  You know, what is their objectives going to be? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=103.08s)]
*  Are they going to attack from different sides or they're going to come from this side here cut off Hamas troops? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=105.08s)]
*  Obviously, this is where the center of gravity is in here with regard to where the Hamas troops are [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=110.8s)]
*  But I think Israel has got to be very concerned overall about from a strategic perspective [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  They have potential of enemy here coming in this direction [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=119.83999999999999s)]
*  They have Hezbollah coming up from the north and if they can mass troops in the West Bank [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  This is going to be the problem here of trying to fight war on three fronts [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=127.28s)]
*  And that's why they've called three hundred thousand troops up [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=131.28s)]
*  So they have to be able to put troops in all these locations [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=133.79999999999998s)]
*  But once they get go back to Gaza once they get into this location here [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=136.51999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be street fighting house to house and again large civilian casualties [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=140.92s)]
*  We talked about the strikes that we've seen over the course of the last several days. There have been air strikes [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=145.28s)]
*  We've seen numerous strikes in very specific facilities at least according to the IDF and what their targets are. What do those tell you? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=149.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're going after if you look at some things. These are mosques now [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  So they have you know, they're taking everything off the table with regard to you know collateral damage again [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=160.48s)]
*  Normally the military wouldn't attack these kinds of targets. They're saying they are clearly military targets [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=165.6s)]
*  And in this case, they're leaving nothing behind, you know in the past [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=171.16s)]
*  They would be more discriminant with regard to what they would go after specific things here [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=174.88s)]
*  They're literally letter leveling all of the kind of targets. They're going after there's nothing left after and those are both mosques that you're showing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and the before and the after or in the after. Yeah [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=184.32s)]
*  On Saturday, there were some rockets fired from Hezbollah in southern Lebanon into Israel [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=187.48s)]
*  Then there was a bit of a pause the Secretary of State Blinken said and then yesterday seeing more can you speak to the [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=192.08s)]
*  Complication of trying to fight Hezbollah in the north of Israel while doing the rest [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=199.16s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=202.68s)]
*  that that's really what Israel's got to be concerned about because they'll have to put troops to the north here and that's this is where [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=203.16s)]
*  They would come from here and then also it would introduce we've worn now the Syrian government that says look if we if Hezbollah decides [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=208.88s)]
*  To come in and they're they're good fighters. They've they've been part of the Syrian Civil War [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=215.68s)]
*  They have that kind of experience then it opens up potentially a front where Damascus becomes a target in this area here [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=219.0s)]
*  I I think the Israel is gonna be forced to put ground troops up there what Israel's advantage here in this conventional war is shock effect [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=224.76000000000002s)]
*  They bring tanks they bring air power. The problem is the enemy's not fighting that kind of battle [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=231.9s)]
*  Exactly, that's it. And that's why this whole thing so this is they you know [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  They prepared for a war that they didn't get and that's really whether in this situation right now [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  What are Hezbollah's capabilities? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=243.24s)]
*  Compared to Hamas because yesterday better better more [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=245.24s)]
*  Have greater capability again still don't really have that shock effect, but they're good fighters [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=249.36s)]
*  And there's there's more of them Israel's got to be concerned this this now creates if if they come in from the north here [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=253.8s)]
*  And and the attacks years are coming from the south this now creates the the nightmare [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=259.48s)]
*  1973 scenario of an attack on both fronts [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6vewZo3jY&t=264.28000000000003s)]
