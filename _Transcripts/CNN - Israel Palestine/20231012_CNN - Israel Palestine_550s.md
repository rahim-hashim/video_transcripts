# 'Dangerous and unhinged': White House reacts to Trump complimenting Hezbollah
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY)
*  And on the political front, it is kind of a miraculous thing we see kind of happening, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=0.0s)]
*  which is we just had Mike McCaul, who's clashed with the administration, the Biden administration [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=5.04s)]
*  before, chairman of House Foreign Affairs, has threatened to hold Tony Blinken in contempt, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=11.24s)]
*  complimenting Tony Blinken in the administration for being there and being on the ground to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  stand with Israel. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=22.16s)]
*  Who is not doing that is the former president of the United States, Donald Trump. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=24.24s)]
*  And I want to play for everyone what he said yesterday because we've also just received [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  a response from the Biden White House. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=34.92s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=37.4s)]
*  I'll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=39.8s)]
*  That was a very terrible thing. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  I will say that when I see sometimes the intelligence, you talk about the intelligence or you talk [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=45.44s)]
*  about some of the things that went wrong over the last week, they've got to straighten it [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  out because they're fighting potentially a very big force. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=55.96s)]
*  And they said, gee, I hope Hezbollah doesn't attack from the north because that's the most [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=59.56s)]
*  vulnerable spot. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=64.56s)]
*  I said, wait a minute. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=65.56s)]
*  You know, Hezbollah is very smart. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=67.32s)]
*  They're all very smart. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=68.68s)]
*  The press doesn't like when they say it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=69.68s)]
*  Very smart. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=73.38s)]
*  From the White House, the White House just put this out, a spokesperson on these statements [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=74.38s)]
*  says, we don't comment on 2024 statements like this are dangerous and unhinged. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=79.56s)]
*  It's completely lost on us. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=85.04s)]
*  Why any American would ever praise an Iran backed terrorist organization as smart or [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  have any objection to the United States warning terrorists not to attack Israel, especially [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=92.2s)]
*  now as Israel is fighting back against one of the worst acts of mass murder in the country's [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  history. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=100.56s)]
*  You know, there used to be an idea that was elevated by Republicans that partisanship [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=101.56s)]
*  ought to end at the water's edge. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=107.12s)]
*  That's particularly true in a time of crisis like this with an ally. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=109.08s)]
*  The fact that Donald Trump didn't have the decency to try to unite the nation, but his [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  instinct is always to divide and make it about himself and then to praise the terrorists [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=119.2s)]
*  who murdering children as very smart. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=127.44s)]
*  You know, it reminds me of language he used after Tiananmen Square, where he praised the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=130.6s)]
*  Chinese government at that time for being tough and smart. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=134.04s)]
*  He seems to praise violent actions by so-called strong men or groups. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=138.24s)]
*  And that's part of that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=143.44s)]
*  It's this instinct to make it all about himself, not thinking about others, let alone thinking [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=144.8s)]
*  about uniting the nation or the world with our allies at this time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=148.8s)]
*  Can I just quickly ask you about that thing? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=151.36s)]
*  We just saw Anthony Blinken in a remarkable, unprecedented gathering of Israelis hugging [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  him, crying in his arms. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=158.72s)]
*  He's a secretary of state. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=159.72s)]
*  He is with the Biden administration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=160.88s)]
*  Do you see this as Donald Trump trying to find his role to get the attention he so craves [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=163.12s)]
*  as opposed to trying to govern, trying to show? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=169.36s)]
*  That's the instinct. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=173.32s)]
*  He's got to insert himself. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=174.32s)]
*  The agita he feels when it's not all about him, even in the midst of a terrorist attack, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=175.76s)]
*  trying to insert himself in the middle of this, the inability to rise above and unite. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=179.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it's about anything more than his ego and his instinct to praise the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=184.16s)]
*  strong men, no matter how ugly that is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  This is not hard to unite right now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  And yet it's impossible. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  Is it as simple, Anna, as maybe? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=196.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=199.16s)]
*  This because for me, Donald Trump is who he is, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=200.16s)]
*  We know who he is. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=203.27999999999997s)]
*  He is an incoherent narcissist who makes everything about himself. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=204.27999999999997s)]
*  But for me, the problem really is people like Senator Tim Scott, who talked about Joe Biden [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=209.16s)]
*  having blood on his hands. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=217.32s)]
*  People like Ronna McDaniel, the head of the RNC, who said this was a great opportunity [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=219.28s)]
*  for Republican candidates. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  That is irresponsible. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=226.16s)]
*  You see, Americans here have to talk with one voice. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=227.16s)]
*  There is one culpable for this. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=230.52s)]
*  There is one group of people with blood on their hands, and it is Hamas. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=232.28s)]
*  And whether you are pro-Palestinian or whether you are pro-Israeli or whether you are pro-vote, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=237.4s)]
*  you have to be against Hamas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=242.16000000000003s)]
*  And that is where our focus as Americans and certainly the members of our government and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  those who have platforms and our leaders should be directing their fire and directing their [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=249.44s)]
*  works. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=255.28s)]
*  And the contrast, again, could not be started. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=256.28s)]
*  At a time when you see Bill Bowie thanking America and thanking Joe Biden, at a time [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=257.76s)]
*  when you see Israelis gathering around our secretary of state, hugging him, and they [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=263.84s)]
*  are hugging him as an extension of America. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=269.4s)]
*  You see here in America, people trying to blame Americans for what just happened in [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=272.24s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=277.04s)]
*  Come on, folks. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=278.04s)]
*  Come on. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=279.04s)]
*  Stop this stupidity. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=280.04s)]
*  Stop the insanity. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=281.04s)]
*  Stop the partisan shots. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=282.04s)]
*  We have to unite at a time like this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=285.48s)]
*  Former U.S. president Donald Trump is criticizing Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=288.56s)]
*  Trump speaking to supporters in Florida recalled an incident involving Israel's role in a 2020 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=294.52s)]
*  U.S. drone strike. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  He said Prime Minister Netanyahu pulled out of the plan to kill Iran's top security and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=301.12s)]
*  intelligence commander. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=305.88s)]
*  When I see sometimes the intelligence, you talk about the intelligence or you talk about [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=309.2s)]
*  some of the things that went wrong over the last week, they've got to straighten it out [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=314.6s)]
*  because they're fighting potentially a very big force. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=318.44s)]
*  I did have a bad experience with Israel, though. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=321.4s)]
*  When we took out Soleimani, it was us and Israel working as a group. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=323.8s)]
*  And the night before it happened, I got a call that Israel will not be participating [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=329.58s)]
*  in this attack. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=337.02s)]
*  I'll never forget that Bibi Netanyahu let us down. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=338.97999999999996s)]
*  That was a very terrible thing. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=343.09999999999997s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=344.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=345.62s)]
*  Olivier Naix, the author of The Washington Post Daily 202 and of course, a national political [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=346.62s)]
*  correspondent is back with us on this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=351.82s)]
*  So Olivier, the stakes are very high, of course, with this story, but the reality is quite [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=355.24s)]
*  par for the course when it comes to Donald Trump. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=362.8s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=365.0s)]
*  I mean, we start we have to start by saying who knows if what he said is true even. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=366.0s)]
*  But, yes, we're trying to figure that out as you and I speak. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=369.08s)]
*  So that's an important caveat. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=372.52s)]
*  I'm glad you raised it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=373.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=375.12s)]
*  But, you know, we've watched we've watched the Israeli response to the Biden administration's [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=376.12s)]
*  support over the last few days. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=380.08s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has just repeatedly praised the Biden administration. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=382.8s)]
*  You saw the show of solidarity today with the secretary of state, Tony Blinken. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=387.12s)]
*  It's not super hard to figure out why Donald Trump might be angry at Bibi Netanyahu now. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=391.44s)]
*  And I don't think it has a lot to do with a years old raid against a airstrike, I should [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=395.88s)]
*  say, against a top Iranian general. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=401.76s)]
*  It is par for the course in another way, which is, of course, that he has historically said [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=406.24s)]
*  a lot of nice things about a lot of bad people. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  He's praised Kim Jong-un. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=413.0s)]
*  He's praised the Chinese response, the Chinese crackdown to Tiananmen Square. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=414.0s)]
*  He praised Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=418.08s)]
*  This is as you say, it's it's very par for the course. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=419.68s)]
*  But I don't think we should look away from this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  No, I'm glad you I'm glad you put it that way. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=425.2s)]
*  I agree. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=427.76s)]
*  And I'm sure that there are people that we're missing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=428.76s)]
*  I want to bring in the rest of our political panel here now. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=429.76s)]
*  Joining us is Brian Fallon. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=432.0s)]
*  He is the co-founder of Demand Justice and the former press secretary for Hillary Clinton's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=433.0s)]
*  2016 presidential campaign. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  We also have Sarah Matthews, the former deputy press secretary with the Trump administration. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  So Sarah, before I get to the before I get to the White House response and talk to Brian [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=444.04s)]
*  about it, I'd just like to kind of give you a chance to respond to what the former president [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=448.2s)]
*  said here about this raid. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=455.12s)]
*  I mean, do you have any knowledge of what did or didn't happen that you're able to share [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=457.28000000000003s)]
*  with us in terms of determining the veracity of what he has to say? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=461.48s)]
*  If not, and perhaps it's classified, so perhaps I'm assuming that if not, I'm just curious [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=466.08s)]
*  at kind of your take on what his motivations might be in saying this now. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=472.28s)]
*  I wasn't at the White House when this raid happened, and so I can't really speak to that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=478.88s)]
*  and his thinking on that specific thing. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  But I think something that is really important to note is that it was reported in 2021 that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=486.52s)]
*  Donald Trump was very unhappy with Netanyahu because Netanyahu was one of the first people [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=491.56s)]
*  to congratulate President Biden on his win in the November election. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  And so I think that that is actually what is most significant and driving Trump's beef [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  with Netanyahu and why he made those remarks. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=506.56s)]
*  He might say it has something to do with that Soleimani strike and that could be part of [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=509.32s)]
*  it. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=513.8s)]
*  But I do think that it's actually that he was upset that Netanyahu acknowledged that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=514.8s)]
*  Biden won the election fair and square. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=519.24s)]
*  And so that seems to be the driving force here. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=521.88s)]
*  But it is really disgusting, these remarks that I think he made where he's, you know, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=524.48s)]
*  the former president is praising Hezbollah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=528.64s)]
*  And I think a lot of Republicans who have been critical of Congresswoman Tlaib for refusing [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=531.52s)]
*  to denounce Hamas should be equally upset then with the former president for praising [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=537.0s)]
*  Hezbollah and making these remarks at a time when we need to show solidarity with Israel [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=542.76s)]
*  and show unwavering support. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHx5qTp2DhY&t=547.8s)]
