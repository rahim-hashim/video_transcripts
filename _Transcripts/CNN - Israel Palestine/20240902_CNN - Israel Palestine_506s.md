# Hear the strong message Rep. Schiff has for Hamas after six hostages killed
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo)
*  It's Labor Day weekend, the traditional kickoff to the home stretch of the presidential campaign. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=0.0s)]
*  Here with me now is Democratic Senate candidate from California, Congressman Adam Schiff. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=6.96s)]
*  I want to talk to you about the campaign in one minute, but first, you are in Oakland, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=12.16s)]
*  California right now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=16.28s)]
*  That is where the Goldberg-Poland family is originally from. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  And I want to get your reaction to the murder of Israeli-American hostage Hirsch Goldberg-Poland [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  and five others. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=29.4s)]
*  Well, when I heard the news last night, I felt sick. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=33.6s)]
*  I am just absolutely heartbroken for Hirsch's family, for the families of these other hostages [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=37.12s)]
*  that were butchered by these Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=44.08s)]
*  And it just is hard to wrap your head around. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=48.08s)]
*  I think we all came to know Hirsch through his family. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=51.44s)]
*  And it's just devastating. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=58.88s)]
*  And these sons of bitches who did this ought to be hunted down and brought to justice, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  no matter how long that takes. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=68.72s)]
*  I hope and pray, I think as we all do, that there's a negotiated end to this war and soon, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=71.28s)]
*  and that not another innocent person loses their life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=78.16s)]
*  And I just can't imagine how his family must feel right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=84.32s)]
*  Congressman, you just heard the Nutras, whose son, Omer, is also in captivity, called not [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=89.12s)]
*  just on Prime Minister Netanyahu, but President Biden multiple times to do more to get these [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=96.32s)]
*  hostages, particularly Americans, home. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=104.2s)]
*  I mean, I asked her about a prayer that she says every day, and she's clearly done with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=107.48s)]
*  prayers. She's frustrated, understandably. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=112.84s)]
*  I'm hearing anecdotally from people saying this is the United States of America. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=115.8s)]
*  And the fact that the American president and American administration can't get American [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  citizens held in these conditions back is very frustrating and a little bit flabbergasted [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=128.4s)]
*  by it. How can the Biden administration answer those frustrations right now? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=136.16s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think the parents of the hostages are doing exactly what they should [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=142.84s)]
*  be doing, exactly what I would be doing in their shoes, as difficult as it is to imagine [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=150.04s)]
*  the horror of standing where they're standing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  And that is pleading, advocating, doing everything possible to get Israeli government to agree [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=159.2s)]
*  to an end to the war that releases their family members and also call upon the president and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=165.04s)]
*  vice president to do everything they can. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=171.84s)]
*  And I think they are. I think President Biden and Vice President Harris are turning over [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=173.52s)]
*  every stone in their efforts to secure the release of the hostages and protect the lives of [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=179.68s)]
*  the hostages and achieve a ceasefire. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=186.2s)]
*  I don't think they go a waking moment without focusing on this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=190.2s)]
*  We're you know, we're not putting boots on the ground in these tunnels under Gaza. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=194.84s)]
*  So it is a very difficult situation in terms of our own ability to rescue these hostages. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=199.12s)]
*  But I really sincerely believe the administration is doing everything possible and is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=206.72s)]
*  committed not only to an end to the war in which the threat from Hamas is eliminated, in [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=213.8s)]
*  which we are on a path at some point and I pray soon to a regional and two state solution [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=220.64s)]
*  that achieves a lasting peace in the region. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=230.28s)]
*  But I really believe they're doing all they possibly can. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=233.48s)]
*  Congressman, I want to turn back domestically to the presidential race, which is 65 days away. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  Election Day is. I want you to listen to how Vice President Harris answered my question [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  this week about a key issue in the campaign. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=249.4s)]
*  In 2019, you said, quote, There is no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=254.72s)]
*  Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must win state of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=259.64s)]
*  Pennsylvania. Do you still want to ban fracking? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=264.24s)]
*  No. And I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020 that I would not ban fracking as [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=267.72s)]
*  vice president. I did not ban fracking as president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=274.2s)]
*  I will not ban fracking. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=277.04s)]
*  You're a co-sponsor of a House bill right now that would ban fracking. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=280.2s)]
*  Are you disappointed that she supports it now? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=284.32s)]
*  Well, you know, I favor banning fracking and I strongly believe that the pathway to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=290.4s)]
*  attacking climate change is to wean ourselves off of fossil fuels. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=298.4s)]
*  But look, I'm not the vice president of the United States. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  And I do think that when you are representing the whole country, you have a different [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=306.4s)]
*  perspective. As the vice president pointed out, her values, though, have remained [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  consistent. And that is she is a champion of moving ourselves in the renewable energy [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=316.0s)]
*  direction. Her role in passing the Inflation Reduction Act, the most aggressive attack on [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  climate change in our history, I think speaks for itself. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  But look, let's compare a situation where someone changed their position four years [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=330.68s)]
*  ago to Donald Trump, who's changed his position four times on abortion in the last 48 [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=339.52s)]
*  hours. That, to me, is, you know, a much more significant question, particularly as when [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=345.32s)]
*  you're talking about abortion and you're talking about a right and freedom of the American [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=352.44s)]
*  people to be so pandering, wishy washy, flip flopping, you know, so disrespectful, the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=358.12s)]
*  rights and freedoms of millions of American women and do all that in a single day. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=366.2s)]
*  That's the contrast here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=371.24s)]
*  And what's more, Dana, that's a values issue. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=373.64s)]
*  That's a values issue. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=377.48s)]
*  When on something like the right to an abortion, you flip flop every 15 minutes, that shows [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=379.2s)]
*  essentially he has no values. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=386.52s)]
*  Congressman Special Counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment against Donald Trump this week [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=389.67999999999995s)]
*  for election interference, even after the Supreme Court ruling on immunity. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  And it comes as two pro-Trump organizations are slated to hold a January 6th awards [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=399.44s)]
*  gala at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster to pay tribute to all J-6 defendants. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=406.32s)]
*  Trump has been invited to speak. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=413.4s)]
*  Organizers say he hasn't ruled it out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=414.88s)]
*  What's your response to the fact that he's whether he goes or not, that he's allowing [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=417.76s)]
*  his property to be used for this event? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=423.04s)]
*  Well, first of all, the Justice Department is exactly right to be refiling these charges [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=428.48s)]
*  after that just absurdly dangerous Supreme Court decision, attempting to give immunity [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=432.36s)]
*  to a president to commit crimes while they're in office. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=438.96s)]
*  So he's right to refile these charges. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  But for the president to allow, you know, this event to go forward, celebrating these [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=444.04s)]
*  people who beat, who gassed, who bear sprayed, who were responsible for the deaths of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=451.12s)]
*  police officers, who essentially tried to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=460.12s)]
*  the first time in our history shows you that for Donald Trump, he could, you know, give [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=466.8s)]
*  a damn about the country, about the Constitution, about the oath of office. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  It's only about him. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  And to glorify these people also is a green light to further violence should he lose the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=477.28s)]
*  upcoming election. So just another dangerous, disrespectful acquiescence in lawlessness [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=484.92s)]
*  by Donald Trump and his enablers. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=494.32s)]
*  Congressman Adam Schiff, candidate for Senate in the great state of California, thank you [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=497.0s)]
*  so much for being here this morning. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=501.76s)]
*  Thanks, Dana. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAd-QXouJUo&t=505.56s)]
