# Israel hostage release deal delayed until Friday
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE)
*  Tonight, explosions continue to rock Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=0.0s)]
*  The pause in fighting is now delayed 24 hours [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=2.7s)]
*  ahead of the expected release of women and children [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=5.58s)]
*  being held hostage by Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=8.38s)]
*  And even after this hostage release, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=10.98s)]
*  the fate of the vast majority of those [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=12.98s)]
*  still being held captive remains very much in question. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=15.18s)]
*  The White House saying today that President Biden [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=18.72s)]
*  has been, quote, personally engaged in negotiations. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=20.8s)]
*  Alex Marquardt is out front in Washington for us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=24.5s)]
*  Alex, what are you learning about the status [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=26.3s)]
*  of negotiations for the rest of the hostages held by Hamas? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=28.4s)]
*  Well, Kate, we've heard repeatedly from U.S. officials [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=31.6s)]
*  that they say they will not rest [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=34.56s)]
*  until the rest of the American hostages come out, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=36.34s)]
*  aside from these women and children, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=40.14s)]
*  that the U.S. will stay very much engaged [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=41.6s)]
*  for all of these hostages. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=43.4s)]
*  But those conversations really have not begun in earnest yet. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=45.54s)]
*  The main focus really has been on getting these women [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=48.68s)]
*  and children out, making sure that this mechanism works. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  It is believed that the easiest negotiations [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=55.08s)]
*  with Hamas were to get these women and children out. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  And that's assuming, of course, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  that this all goes according to plan, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=62.68000000000001s)]
*  that these 50 or more actually come out in the coming days. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=64.48s)]
*  I was speaking with an official [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=68.06s)]
*  who is involved in these conversations, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=70.0s)]
*  briefed on the negotiations, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=72.26s)]
*  who told me that this first swap of 50 people [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=74.36s)]
*  is the most crucial to make sure that this mechanism [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=77.54s)]
*  is working as was agreed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=80.36s)]
*  So assuming this goes smoothly, you then have, as you say, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=82.30000000000001s)]
*  the vast majority of the hostages who remain, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=85.58000000000001s)]
*  they really do fall into three distinct buckets. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  You have men who are both elderly [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=90.74s)]
*  and non-Israeli nationals. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=93.64s)]
*  Then you have Israeli soldiers, both men and women. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=95.78s)]
*  And then you have bodies, people who were killed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=98.48s)]
*  either on October 7th or since then. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=100.58s)]
*  U.S. and Israeli officials agree [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=103.94s)]
*  that the most difficult negotiations [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=105.64s)]
*  are gonna be around the Israeli soldiers, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=107.47999999999999s)]
*  both the men and the women. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  No one in Israel certainly has forgotten the exchange [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=111.02s)]
*  of Gilad Shalit back in 2011. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=114.88s)]
*  He was held for years by Hamas, and when he was exchanged, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=117.82s)]
*  Hamas was able to get more than 1,000 prisoners [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=121.18s)]
*  out of Israeli prisons. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=124.56s)]
*  So it is possible that the conversations [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=126.06s)]
*  about the rest of the hostages begin soon, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=129.1s)]
*  but it could be quite some time [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=131.3s)]
*  before the rest of those hostages come home, Kate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=133.5s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard weeks, months, how it's described to me [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=135.54s)]
*  by a couple people just today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=138.9s)]
*  It's good to see, Alex, thank you so much. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=140.54s)]
*  Out front with me now, Jonathan Dekelchen, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=142.48s)]
*  his son, Segey, is among those kidnapped by Hamas [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=144.32000000000002s)]
*  now nearly seven weeks ago, still captive in Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=147.86s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you for coming on tonight. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=151.9s)]
*  Given what we know about this agreement, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  it does seem unlikely that Segey will be among [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  those released in this moment. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  What then does this moment feel like for you? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=164.22s)]
*  Well, I think it's two poles. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=169.22s)]
*  The first pole is assuming that Hamas can deliver [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=172.8s)]
*  on its promise here that these 50 women and children [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=177.4s)]
*  will be released. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=181.04s)]
*  I'm overjoyed for them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=181.88s)]
*  Keep in mind that from my kibbutz alone, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=183.98s)]
*  from my one community alone, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  there are still 75 hostages being held by Hamas [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=188.02s)]
*  since October 7th. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=191.32s)]
*  Of the list that's been published, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=192.96s)]
*  there are multiple children and women and moms, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=196.06s)]
*  including Liat Tatsili, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=199.98000000000002s)]
*  who you spoke with her dad a few minutes ago. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=201.70000000000002s)]
*  These are all my neighbors, my friends, my kids' friends, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=204.28s)]
*  my grandchildren's friends. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=207.68s)]
*  So I couldn't be more pleased for those families [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  because it's like my extended family coming home. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=214.02s)]
*  On the other hand, it's very difficult to say [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  in terms of Segey and the other 190 hostages. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=223.96s)]
*  Again, 190 hostages who weren't referred to at all [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=226.26s)]
*  in this stage of the agreement. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  It's almost impossible to say given Hamas [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=233.88s)]
*  as a sort of a barbarian terrorist organization [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=237.84s)]
*  with no regard for human life, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=242.64s)]
*  Israeli or Palestinian for that matter, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=244.64s)]
*  what this first stage might say about the coming stages. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=247.22s)]
*  Do you allow yourself to think about that moment [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=252.24s)]
*  when you will see Segey again? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=259.46s)]
*  It seems just like, I keep thinking of this, Jonathan, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=261.92s)]
*  because it's like this moment of like [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=265.36s)]
*  being in a suspended nightmare. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=268.8s)]
*  I almost envision it feels like being just seven weeks, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=270.46s)]
*  nearly seven weeks now since that horrible, horrible day. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=274.56s)]
*  I just wonder if you allow yourself [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=279.35999999999996s)]
*  to think about that moment. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=282.2s)]
*  Well, there's not a waking or even a sleeping moment [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  that I'm not thinking about Segey in some measure. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=288.28s)]
*  And I can certainly visualize and love visualizing [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=291.44s)]
*  his two little girls running into, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  leaping into his arms when he comes home [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=297.96s)]
*  and in hopes that he comes home quickly, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=301.58s)]
*  but if not, then meeting his third little girl [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=305.15999999999997s)]
*  who's set to be born in a couple of weeks. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  So I absolutely have that in mind as something [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=310.46s)]
*  that I'm working for or towards together [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  with the release of all of the hostages. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=318.34s)]
*  God, his poor wife and what she's going through [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=320.8s)]
*  and about to bring another beautiful child [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=323.64s)]
*  into the world in the midst of this. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=325.74s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=328.14s)]
*  How is she doing? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=329.08s)]
*  How's the rest of the family handling this news right now [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=330.24s)]
*  of this deal? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=334.48s)]
*  Well, we're doing the best we can. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a multi-level crisis really [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=339.18s)]
*  because not just Segey's family wife into two young daughters, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=341.94s)]
*  but I have another daughter who lives on the Kibbutz [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=346.44s)]
*  with her young family. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=348.92s)]
*  So there are four little kids between the age of two and six [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=350.52s)]
*  who are utterly traumatized by this hell on earth [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=354.82s)]
*  that befell the Kibbutz on October 7th. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=357.92s)]
*  So missing our loved ones, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=360.7s)]
*  those that were murdered. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=364.76s)]
*  All of my grandkids, again, from age two to six, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=366.35999999999996s)]
*  have close friends who are no longer alive, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=369.41999999999996s)]
*  who were murdered in their beds on October 7th. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=372.96s)]
*  So we have to deal with that. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=378.03999999999996s)]
*  And we also have to deal with the fact that our community, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  as a whole, our cooperative farm, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=382.7s)]
*  like many others around the Gaza Strip, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=384.78s)]
*  not just were massacred, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=389.58s)]
*  but rather also had all of their properties stolen [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=392.3s)]
*  by hundreds, thousands of looters actually from Gaza. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=395.7s)]
*  And then whatever could not be looted [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=399.14s)]
*  was burned to the ground. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=400.94s)]
*  So there's no going home for any of these kids [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=402.48s)]
*  or the adults. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=406.18s)]
*  Our home as we knew it no longer exists. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=407.18s)]
*  It's a series of tragedies for us Israeli civilians [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=409.92s)]
*  and honestly for the Palestinian civilians as well, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  who find themselves in this horrible situation, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=418.86s)]
*  not of their making, but by Hamas's making. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=422.14s)]
*  We keep ourselves busy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=424.94s)]
*  I mean, in thinking about what the future will bring for us [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=426.44s)]
*  for me personally, working with the press [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=431.22s)]
*  and with governments in Israel and abroad, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=434.82s)]
*  keeping laser attention focused [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=437.56s)]
*  on this humanitarian universal issue and challenge [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=440.66s)]
*  of our hostages in the hands of Hamas [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=445.36s)]
*  and taking care of the little ones the best we can [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=448.06s)]
*  and trying to help them make sense of shattered lives. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=452.41999999999996s)]
*  Make sense of what is impossible to make sense of. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=455.26s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you so much. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h70bJk13-KE&t=459.9s)]
