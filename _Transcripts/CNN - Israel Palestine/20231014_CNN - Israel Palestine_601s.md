# Retired colonel: Military buildup around Gaza ‘reminiscent of a scene from D-Day’
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s)
*  I want to go to the ground. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to turn to someone who is right now fighting on the front lines of this war. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=1.12s)]
*  Joining me now is IDF soldier Rudy Rockman. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=5.76s)]
*  Rudy, you are quite literally, as we can see there in your picture, you are called now [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=9.36s)]
*  to duty. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=15.44s)]
*  What have the last few days been like for you on the ground and where you are in Israel, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=16.8s)]
*  which by the way, I should say, we are not specifically naming, just for security reasons [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=21.72s)]
*  as well? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=26.88s)]
*  Yeah, thank you for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=28.84s)]
*  I mean, it's been almost a week since this started. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=30.4s)]
*  And as a reservist, I've been out of the army for over 10 years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=32.8s)]
*  I'm a civilian. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=35.4s)]
*  I've done my degrees. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=36.4s)]
*  I have work. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=38.08s)]
*  I have families. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=39.08s)]
*  And all of a sudden on Saturday morning, it was Shabbat and it was Sukkot. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=40.08s)]
*  It was the holiday for the Jewish people. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=43.08s)]
*  We get called up. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=44.64s)]
*  We started seeing these videos of what had taken place in the morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=45.64s)]
*  And our entire unit got deployed to Kfar Aza, which is a village on the border of Gaza, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=48.8s)]
*  which had some of the most horrendous massacres. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  And unfortunately, we were there for four days rescuing the remaining civilians that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=55.44s)]
*  remained. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=58.96s)]
*  But when we got there, it was a massacre. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=59.96s)]
*  We saw bodies of men, women, children, elderly, caught up into pieces, the most gruesome images [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  you can ever imagine. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=67.96s)]
*  And it was very unfortunate to see those things. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=69.4s)]
*  But thankfully, we were able to secure the area. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=71.6s)]
*  And since then, we're ready to be deployed to the next location. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  As you prepare for what this next phase of the war looks like, Israeli officials have [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=77.8s)]
*  been pretty clear that the plan right now, the objective is to wipe out Hamas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=82.16s)]
*  But I wonder, do you think that that will require street by street fighting? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  And are you personally prepared for what that would mean? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=92.42s)]
*  I mean, the entire army has been prepared for this war. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=95.88s)]
*  Hamas' goal from its very beginning has been to eliminate the Jewish people and to eliminate [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=99.4s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=104.0s)]
*  It's actually been in their constitution when they built their government saying that they [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=105.0s)]
*  not only in Israel, but in the entire world. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=110.8s)]
*  So when you give a terrorist organization like that weapons to go and fulfill their [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=113.08s)]
*  goals, we know what that looks like, whether it's for Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=117.36s)]
*  or Hezbollah, or all these different groups that are actually oppressing its peoples and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=121.08s)]
*  don't actually represent its peoples. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=125.16s)]
*  If you speak to Palestinians on the ground, whether in Judea and Samaria, the West Bank, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=126.72s)]
*  or in Gaza, they do not like Hamas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  They do not like the Palestinian Authority. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=132.66s)]
*  They're on their, what, 20th year of their four-year term. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=134.46s)]
*  These are oppressive regimes that are controlling their people and not only attacking Israeli [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=137.02s)]
*  civilians, but forcing Palestinians to also be caught into this conflict. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=141.58s)]
*  Israelis do not want to see either Israelis die or Palestinians die. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  The majority of us are innocents. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=149.22s)]
*  And this is not a war between the people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=150.94s)]
*  Let me make it clear. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=152.56s)]
*  The Jews are not fighting the Muslims and the Israelis are not fighting the Palestinians. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=153.56s)]
*  We're fighting Hamas, which is oppressing both Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=157.06s)]
*  Are we ready? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=160.56s)]
*  We are ready. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=161.56s)]
*  But we also need to not only look at what is happening, we need to understand why it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=162.56s)]
*  is happening. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=166.1s)]
*  And this really started with the West pushing narratives of dividing Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=167.1s)]
*  The reality is that there is no future without Palestinians and without Israelis. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=171.9s)]
*  Neither of us are going to disappear. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=175.98s)]
*  So I hope that when this settles, we can learn from this and transcend this conflict together. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=177.66s)]
*  It's an important point. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=181.94s)]
*  And I think so many people share your hope that if there is an end to this, hopefully [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  there is, that it's one that is obviously a lot more peaceful. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=188.4s)]
*  As we sit here, there's so much concern right now about the one million or so Palestinians [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=192.06s)]
*  who are being told to flee the northern part of Gaza right now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=197.18s)]
*  I've noted that you've observed in the past that Hamas uses civilian casualties of Palestinians [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=202.62s)]
*  as a propaganda tool. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=209.1s)]
*  But are you worried that this operation carried out by Israel could ultimately play into Hamas's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=210.74s)]
*  hands if those civilians are not able to evacuate and many of them end up killed? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=217.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=221.5s)]
*  I don't want to see any civilian killed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=222.5s)]
*  For me, you're a foreigner, you're a fellow human being, but for me, Palestinians are [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=225.58s)]
*  my cousins. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=230.18s)]
*  They're my family. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=231.18s)]
*  So I don't want to see any Palestinians killed. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=232.18s)]
*  And I'm glad that they have at least 24 hours to be able to evacuate. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=233.74s)]
*  Israelis have less than 24 seconds to be able to evacuate when they're being fired on. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=237.22s)]
*  But when we look at people in Gaza, I really hope we can minimize the casualties because [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=240.5s)]
*  none of us want to see anybody dead. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=244.58s)]
*  We want to remove Hamas so it can stop being a threat both for Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=246.46s)]
*  And in order to transcend this conflict, it's not just about creating peace, it's about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=250.82000000000002s)]
*  creating justice. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=254.02s)]
*  There's injustice both for Israelis and both for Palestinians. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  And there's one land and one land that we can both live on. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=258.26s)]
*  But in order to get there, we have to stop these zero-sum game narratives that are educating [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=261.36s)]
*  people that in order to be pro-Israel, you have to be anti-Palestinian, or in order to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=266.38s)]
*  be pro-Palestinian, you have to be anti-Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=269.74s)]
*  The reality if you're anti either, you're anti both because we both belong on this land [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=271.74s)]
*  and we will both be here eternally. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=275.54s)]
*  You mentioned that you've been out of the Israeli military for about 10 years. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=277.58s)]
*  Is there anything in your experience that compares to what you are about to go into? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=281.26s)]
*  And how long are you expecting this conflict to last? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=284.82s)]
*  Yes, I got out of the army in 2013, so in 2012 there was an operation on the border [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=288.38s)]
*  where we almost went into Gaza. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=294.14s)]
*  Shortly after I finished the army in 2014, the IDF went into Gaza. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=296.1s)]
*  So this is not something new, unfortunately. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=299.98s)]
*  But I hope this will be the last time that this happens. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=302.46s)]
*  We certainly hope it will be for you and for really everyone in the region. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=305.62s)]
*  Rudy Rockman, thank you for joining us and we wish you all the best. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=310.02s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=313.7s)]
*  And for a closer look at what's happening on the developing battlefield right now, I'm [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=316.74s)]
*  joined by CNN military analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=321.62s)]
*  Colonel Leighton, we've been discussing the issue of the potential refugees that could [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=326.02s)]
*  be made in Gaza if they do flee. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=333.82s)]
*  Talk to us about what evacuation even looks like in Gaza right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=336.7s)]
*  I think about a million people in that part of the territory. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=341.34s)]
*  Where do they even go? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=345.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to be the real question, Abby. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=346.78s)]
*  And let's take a look at the evacuation zone as we know it right now. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=349.1s)]
*  Because when you see the types of things that can happen here, you've got this area in the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=353.86s)]
*  north. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=358.94s)]
*  There are about 1.1 million people that are in this area at this point. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=359.94s)]
*  And what's going to happen, Abby, is they are supposed to, according to what the Israelis [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=365.34s)]
*  have told them, go down here toward the Rafah crossing right here at the Egyptian border. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=369.64s)]
*  So their ability to do this kind of thing is actually going to be limited because they [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=376.9s)]
*  really don't have a humanitarian corridor coming through this way. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=381.84s)]
*  And can you give us a sense of the distance here? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=387.18s)]
*  Or the distances, both the space up here and how far they would need to travel? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=388.18s)]
*  Yeah, so basically we're talking about 25 to 30 miles down this way. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=391.58s)]
*  It's a very small place. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=395.7s)]
*  Gaza is about 140 square miles total. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=397.34s)]
*  Total population about 2.2 million people. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=400.74s)]
*  So it's pretty dense in terms of its population. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=403.14s)]
*  And what they're going to have to do in a case like this is not only go through these [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=406.06s)]
*  areas, but there are no safe zones in any of these areas. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=411.82s)]
*  And when you go through these areas, which are less densely populated than the northern [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=415.26s)]
*  area, there are less services, there's less of an ability to care for people. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=421.3s)]
*  And if they don't get this crossing opened, they won't be able to really stay in this [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=426.02s)]
*  area for a long period of time because it's going to be a place where they don't have [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=430.82s)]
*  living facilities, they don't have water, they don't have sanitation or any of those [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=435.5s)]
*  things. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=438.9s)]
*  So we're going to talk now about the buildup that we're seeing of Israeli troops around [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=439.97999999999996s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=444.58s)]
*  As you can see, they're basically surrounding Gaza. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=446.29999999999995s)]
*  And then just to show our audience here, these are some pictures of just the heavy machinery [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=449.26s)]
*  that is part of that buildup. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=456.5s)]
*  When you look at this as someone with a military eye, tell us what you're seeing and what does [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=457.65999999999997s)]
*  it tell us about what the Israelis are preparing for? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=462.21999999999997s)]
*  So this is kind of reminiscent of a scene from D-Day back in 1944 when Eisenhower was [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=464.86s)]
*  talking to his paratroopers before they launched that invasion. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=470.1s)]
*  This is what units do. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=473.46000000000004s)]
*  The commanding officer will talk to the units, they will go out, they will deploy in forward [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=475.58000000000004s)]
*  positions. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=479.82s)]
*  You see the Merkava tanks coming through and armored personnel carriers. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=480.82s)]
*  Merkava tanks right there, they're Israeli made, they've been in service since 1979 [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=484.5s)]
*  in the Israeli army. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=488.82s)]
*  They've got radio equipment, they've got their rifles, they've got ammunition. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=490.42s)]
*  They are ready to go. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=495.42s)]
*  These people are well trained, they're ready to go and they will deploy to forward positions [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=496.7s)]
*  that are right near the Gaza border. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=502.86s)]
*  Obviously, this has been a week now of really intense bombing in Gaza. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  And I just want to give our audience a sense here of how this compares to another previous [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=511.94s)]
*  conflict that lasted 50 days, almost the same number of bombs dropped in that time [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=518.1s)]
*  and the death toll here. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=525.78s)]
*  Colonel Layton, what can we expect really, this is 50 days versus six days, we're almost [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=529.38s)]
*  at the same place. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=535.38s)]
*  As we go forward, what can we realistically expect in terms of the toll that this will [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=536.86s)]
*  all take? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=540.6s)]
*  Abby, I'm afraid it's going to be a very heavy toll and this could be an exceptionally [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=541.6s)]
*  gruesome war. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=546.38s)]
*  All wars are gruesome, but this one, because of the close quarters, because of the urban [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=547.62s)]
*  combat that's inevitably going to happen through the narrow alleyways of Gaza City and other [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=552.08s)]
*  places like that, I'm afraid that this death toll is going to rise considerably. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=557.22s)]
*  There are ways to mitigate that. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=562.1s)]
*  Israel says it's trying to do that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=563.7s)]
*  The problem is that Hamas will use innocent civilians as human shields in this scenario [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=565.62s)]
*  and that's something that has happened in other places. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=571.54s)]
*  In Iraq it happened, in Afghanistan it happened. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=573.94s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that we can expect and unfortunately if this isn't stopped, we're [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=576.58s)]
*  going to see a situation where the forces will meet and there's going to be a major [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=581.58s)]
*  increase in this death toll. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=588.82s)]
*  Yeah, I think we just have to be clear-eyed about what we are facing in this region going [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=590.22s)]
*  forward. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=595.5s)]
*  It's going to be gruesome, unfortunately. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=596.5s)]
*  Colonel Layton, we appreciate you joining us on all of that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Rv6c3NP3s&t=598.3000000000001s)]
