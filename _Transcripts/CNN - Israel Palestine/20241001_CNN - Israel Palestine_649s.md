# Iran fired 180 missiles at Israel, according to initial Israeli military estimate
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs)
*  We are following breaking news, Iran launching a barrage of missiles into Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=0.0s)]
*  A major escalation in the conflict in the Middle East. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=4.0s)]
*  I'm Anderson Cooper alongside my colleague, Wolf Blitzer. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=6.0s)]
*  We've witnessed missiles intercepted across Israel a short time ago, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=9.0s)]
*  as air raid sirens went off on the ground below. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=12.0s)]
*  The Israeli military now confirms some of those missiles [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=15.0s)]
*  made a direct impact in central and southern Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=18.0s)]
*  It's estimated Iran launched nearly 200 projectiles. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=21.0s)]
*  Iran says this attack was in response for the killing of Hezbollah's leader, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=26.0s)]
*  Hassan Nasrallah, and other assassinations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=29.0s)]
*  A source says the Israeli security cabinet is in their emergency bunker right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=32.0s)]
*  The Israeli military says Iran's attack, and I'm quoting now, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=37.0s)]
*  will have consequences. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=40.0s)]
*  The White House says both President Biden and Vice President Harris [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=43.0s)]
*  are in the White House Situation Room monitoring the situation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=46.0s)]
*  We're standing by to get an immediate update from White House officials [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=49.0s)]
*  and from the U.S. State Department. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=53.0s)]
*  We also expect to hear from the Pentagon. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=55.0s)]
*  I want to show you the moment CNN crews saw the Iranian missiles [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=57.0s)]
*  entering Tel Aviv's airspace earlier this afternoon. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=60.0s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=64.0s)]
*  This is a major attack. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=66.0s)]
*  Jim Schuto, this is obviously... [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=70.0s)]
*  It's a major attack. There's no question. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=72.0s)]
*  What you are seeing, what we are all seeing with our own eyes, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=74.0s)]
*  is a major attack from Iran. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=76.0s)]
*  It's a major attack, Dana, and it's an escalation. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=80.0s)]
*  It's an escalation of this war beyond what we saw, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=83.0s)]
*  I think potentially beyond what we saw in April, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=90.0s)]
*  when Iran launched dozens of missiles and drones. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=92.0s)]
*  This attack, according to U.S. intelligence, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=97.0s)]
*  principally or perhaps entirely ballistic missiles, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=100.0s)]
*  which are the fastest by far and the most dangerous. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=104.0s)]
*  Come and see it from here. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=110.0s)]
*  Come and see it from here, mama. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=113.0s)]
*  Look at it. Look at it. Yes, it's here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=126.0s)]
*  Holy sh... [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=139.0s)]
*  What we're seeing in addition to those intercepts [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=159.0s)]
*  is we're seeing fragments falling to the ground. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=162.0s)]
*  It's like a deadly fireworks display over Tel Aviv. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=164.0s)]
*  Goodness, there was an impact just to the left of us here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=170.0s)]
*  And you're talking about Tel Aviv, Jim. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=173.0s)]
*  We are looking at pictures right now. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=175.0s)]
*  We are looking at pictures of Tel Aviv, what you're describing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=177.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. Oh, God. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=181.0s)]
*  Okay, guys, we've got to get off the roof. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=184.0s)]
*  These are coming down right next to us here. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=185.0s)]
*  Please do, Jim. Please do. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=187.0s)]
*  They're coming down. One just about... [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=190.0s)]
*  We've got to go inside. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=192.0s)]
*  So that was roughly half an hour and a half ago. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=194.0s)]
*  I want to go back to Jim Schiddo, who is still in Tel Aviv, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=197.0s)]
*  back on the roof. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=200.0s)]
*  He saw it cover at a certain point about an hour or so ago. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=201.0s)]
*  Jim, just talk about what... [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=206.0s)]
*  First of all, how are things right now? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=208.0s)]
*  And talk a little bit about the video [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=210.0s)]
*  that we just saw, what we were looking at. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=212.0s)]
*  So right now, I should be clear, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=218.0s)]
*  the air raid sirens have ended, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=219.0s)]
*  and there was an announcement a short time ago [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=222.0s)]
*  saying it's okay to return safely. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=224.0s)]
*  And as I understand it, even Iranian officials have said [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=226.0s)]
*  that this attack, from their perspective, is over. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=230.0s)]
*  But let me describe as this was happening, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=233.0s)]
*  and to be clear, it's our whole team here, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=235.0s)]
*  and you know well, Anderson, that there's a lot of folks [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=237.0s)]
*  that go into getting images like that on the air. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=240.0s)]
*  What we were seeing was not just the incoming missiles, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=244.0s)]
*  but the whole array of Israeli air defenses [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=247.0s)]
*  firing to intercept those missiles. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=251.0s)]
*  And it's multi-layered around the city, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=253.0s)]
*  both in terms of the altitudes they strike, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=255.0s)]
*  but also just layers of defenses. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=257.0s)]
*  And as it struck me, as I was watching it, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=260.0s)]
*  is that they were coming to a meeting point in the sky [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=263.0s)]
*  just above us, just to the east of us here, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=266.0s)]
*  but also increasingly above our heads, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=269.0s)]
*  so that we saw, we could see the missile fragments, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=272.0s)]
*  as you're seeing there, coming down, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=276.0s)]
*  or perhaps the intercepted missiles, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=278.0s)]
*  once they've completed their mission, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=280.0s)]
*  perhaps struck a target, coming down. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=281.0s)]
*  And the one you just saw right there on the screen, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=283.0s)]
*  because I believe that's the top of our hotel there [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=285.0s)]
*  with the blue light, came just to the right of us. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=287.0s)]
*  And once it was clear to me, Anderson and Wolf, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=290.0s)]
*  that these intercepts were taking place above our heads, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=293.0s)]
*  Gravity Works, we decided to go inside [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=297.0s)]
*  until that particular barrage was over. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=300.0s)]
*  Then there was a pause in between. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=302.0s)]
*  We came out again, and then there was a second barrage [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=304.0s)]
*  of about the same duration. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=307.0s)]
*  So at least dozens of missiles, it seems. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=309.0s)]
*  And I find it remarkable, frankly, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=312.0s)]
*  that there were no casualties, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=314.0s)]
*  as Admiral Hogari just said a short time ago, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=316.0s)]
*  because in addition to those impacts [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=318.0s)]
*  that you're seeing there on the air, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=321.0s)]
*  there was quite a large one just to the north of us [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=322.0s)]
*  with flames and smoke rising off in the distance. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=325.0s)]
*  So I think that folks were listening [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=329.0s)]
*  to those air raid signals. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=332.0s)]
*  Thankfully, they were going into shelters. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=334.0s)]
*  They have a lot of experience with that here, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=336.0s)]
*  and there was probably some good fortune involved [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=338.0s)]
*  that prevented there being casualties. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=340.0s)]
*  I should note, though, we mentioned this earlier, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=342.0s)]
*  there were casualties tonight in Tel Aviv, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=345.0s)]
*  eight people killed at a light rail station, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=347.0s)]
*  a shooting at a light rail station [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=350.0s)]
*  just before those missiles started falling. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=352.0s)]
*  And Israeli authorities say they're investigating that [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=355.0s)]
*  as a potential terrorist attack. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=358.0s)]
*  I want to go now to our Ben Wiedemann, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=360.0s)]
*  who's standing by in Beirut. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=362.0s)]
*  Ben, explain what you heard from your vantage point in Beirut [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=364.0s)]
*  as these strikes were going on in Israel. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=369.0s)]
*  What we saw, Anderson, was fireworks [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=376.0s)]
*  over the southern suburbs of Beirut, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=379.0s)]
*  an area where Hezbollah has many supporters. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=381.0s)]
*  We also heard a celebratory gunfire. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=384.0s)]
*  And I'm watching as I'm speaking to you [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=387.0s)]
*  Hezbollah's TV station, El Manar, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=390.0s)]
*  is running loops of incoming missiles hitting Israel. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=393.0s)]
*  So clearly, among those supporters of Hezbollah, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=398.0s)]
*  there is a certain amount of satisfaction [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=402.0s)]
*  seeing this happen, keeping in mind that two weeks ago, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=405.0s)]
*  with the pager attacks, the walkie-talkie attacks, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=409.0s)]
*  and since over the last eight days, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=412.0s)]
*  punishing Israeli airstrikes, and of course, last Friday, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=414.0s)]
*  the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=417.0s)]
*  the leader of Hezbollah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=420.0s)]
*  Certainly, Hezbollah has taken just one body blow after another. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=422.0s)]
*  So clearly, there are certain elements within Lebanese society [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=426.0s)]
*  that are taking satisfaction at what is going on at the moment, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=430.0s)]
*  not necessarily the broader population in Lebanon, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=436.0s)]
*  many of whom have just been sitting, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=440.0s)]
*  watching television with a certain amount of dread, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=442.0s)]
*  certainly over the last 24 hours, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=445.0s)]
*  as we've seen Israel start limited ground operations [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=447.0s)]
*  so far into the south. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=452.0s)]
*  But certainly, this additional development [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=454.0s)]
*  of these extensive Iranian missile strikes on Israel [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=458.0s)]
*  certainly raises the level of concern to heights [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=463.0s)]
*  we haven't seen yet. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=467.0s)]
*  Anderson? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=469.0s)]
*  Let me pick it up, it's Wolf. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=470.0s)]
*  Ben, as you know, and all of our, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=472.0s)]
*  most of our viewers should know by now, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=474.0s)]
*  Hezbollah, the Hezbollah forces in south Lebanon [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=476.0s)]
*  have accumulated thousands of rockets and drones and missiles, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=479.0s)]
*  potentially that could be aimed towards Israel. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=483.0s)]
*  I haven't seen a huge, I mean, they've been doing it a lot. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=486.0s)]
*  They started October 8th, the day after October 7th, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=490.0s)]
*  they began Hezbollah, launching some of these rockets and missiles [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=493.0s)]
*  towards Israel, but given their capabilities [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=496.0s)]
*  and the assumption by U.S. intelligence, Israeli intelligence, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=499.0s)]
*  was that Hezbollah always had a major threat, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=502.0s)]
*  potential threat to Israel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=505.0s)]
*  Why haven't the Hezbollah forces in south Lebanon [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=507.0s)]
*  launched more of these projectiles towards Israel? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=510.0s)]
*  It's important to note, Wolf, that the projectiles they launch [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=516.0s)]
*  from southern Israel tend to be short-ranged, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=519.0s)]
*  focused on Israeli military positions along the border. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=522.0s)]
*  They have longer-range missiles that we do not believe they keep [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=527.0s)]
*  in that area where, as we've seen, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=530.0s)]
*  there's a high probability of an Israeli ground incursion. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=533.0s)]
*  Those are kept further north, away from the Israelis. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=536.0s)]
*  Why haven't they used them so far? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=540.0s)]
*  That's a question many people here are asking. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=543.0s)]
*  It probably has something to do with the fact that what we've seen, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=546.0s)]
*  going back to July 30th, is the gradual and increasingly rapid elimination [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=550.0s)]
*  of many of the senior commanders of Hezbollah, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=555.0s)]
*  and of course Hassan Nasrallah last Friday. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=560.0s)]
*  Now, yesterday we did hear from one of the senior deputies of Nasrallah, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=564.0s)]
*  Naim Qasim, who said in a television broadcast that despite these blows, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=569.0s)]
*  Hezbollah has not collapsed, that they still are able to function. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=576.0s)]
*  Now, the question is, is the fact that they haven't fired [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=580.0s)]
*  some of their longer, heavier weaponry, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=584.0s)]
*  is it because of the elimination of the military command, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=588.0s)]
*  or is it because they're holding it in reserve in the event [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=593.0s)]
*  there is a full-on invasion of southern Lebanon? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=597.0s)]
*  And certainly we are getting indications from, for instance, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=601.0s)]
*  warnings on Twitter from the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=604.0s)]
*  about telling people essentially to go tens of kilometers north, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=609.0s)]
*  away from southern Lebanon. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=614.0s)]
*  The indications are there may well be a full-on Israeli invasion of the south, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=616.0s)]
*  in which case there's a much higher probability that Hezbollah, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=621.0s)]
*  which already feels crippled and cornered, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=626.0s)]
*  may unleash its heaviest weapons yet. Wolf? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=629.0s)]
*  And some of those heaviest weapons potentially could reach [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=633.0s)]
*  not only Haifa in northern Israel, but even Tel Aviv, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=636.0s)]
*  and perhaps even further south in Israel. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=639.0s)]
*  And the Israelis have always been very, very worried about that possibility. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=642.0s)]
*  Ben, stay safe over there in Beirut. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgoGxBBJOrs&t=646.0s)]
