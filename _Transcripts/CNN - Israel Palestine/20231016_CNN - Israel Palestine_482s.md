# 'A mistake': Biden warns against Israel occupying Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM)
*  President Biden sounding off on the war between Israel and Hamas in a sweeping interview with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=0.0s)]
*  60 Minutes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=5.76s)]
*  The president touched on bringing the American hostages home and whether U.S. troops could [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=6.76s)]
*  be sent into combat. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=11.92s)]
*  Also talked about the crucially needed humanitarian quarter in Gaza and his message to the Lebanese [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=13.6s)]
*  militant group Hezbollah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=18.54s)]
*  I'm saying we're going to do everything in our power to find those who are still alive [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=19.84s)]
*  and set them free. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  We're working on our power and I'm not going to go into the detail of that but there's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=29.18s)]
*  a we're working like hell on it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=33.86s)]
*  Can you foresee U.S. troops in combat in this new Middle East war? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=36.1s)]
*  I don't think that's necessary. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=42.7s)]
*  Israel has one of the finest fighting forces in the country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=44.86s)]
*  I guarantee we're going to provide them everything they need. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=47.46s)]
*  You would like to see a humanitarian corridor that allows some of the two million Gazans [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=50.7s)]
*  out of the area. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=56.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=57.46s)]
*  You would like to see humanitarian supplies brought into Gaza. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=58.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  So you do not agree with the Israeli total siege of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  I'm confident that Israel is going to act under the major rules of war. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=69.18s)]
*  Would you support Israeli occupation of Gaza at this point? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=74.86s)]
*  I think it'd be a big mistake. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=79.02s)]
*  Do you believe that Hamas must be eliminated entirely? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=80.5s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=83.38s)]
*  There needs to be a Palestinian authority. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=86.64s)]
*  There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  I wonder what is your message to Hezbollah and its backer Iran. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=95.0s)]
*  Don't. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=100.48s)]
*  Don't. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=101.48s)]
*  Don't. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  Don't. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=103.48s)]
*  Don't. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=104.48s)]
*  Don't come across the border. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=105.48s)]
*  Don't escalate this war. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=106.52s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=107.88s)]
*  Sands, Christiane Mampour is live in London with more. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=108.88s)]
*  And Christiane, obviously they try to do with words everything they can to avoid a larger [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  war. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  But nonetheless, Biden saying that while Hamas must be eliminated, reoccupying Gaza would [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=121.8s)]
*  be a mistake. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=127.6s)]
*  How do you read between the lines here of what he's saying and most important, what [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=130.24s)]
*  Israel and its enemies are hearing? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=134.96s)]
*  There aren't any lines to read between. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=138.52s)]
*  The fact is that we do not know and nor do the Israelis and nor do the Americans know [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=140.08s)]
*  what the final end game is. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=144.16s)]
*  What do you do when and if you destroy and decapitate and decimate Hamas politically [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=145.96s)]
*  and militarily, if it's possible? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=150.96s)]
*  What is the final end game? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  So that is an issue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  The wider war that the United States is trying to head off, given that Secretary of State [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=157.52s)]
*  Antony Blinken is doing a real shuttle diplomacy across all those major Middle Eastern capitals, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=162.44s)]
*  that is also a real problem. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  What happens? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  He said don't when asked about Hamas, rather Hezbollah and Iran. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister meeting with Hamas in Qatar, having been also to meet with Hezbollah, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=176.32s)]
*  has basically now said that Iran will not stand idly by if the airstrikes against Palestinians [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  continue. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  The United States has already, Israel rather, has already bombed airstrips in Syria, both [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  in Damascus and in Aleppo, and there are constant skirmishes across the border. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=195.74s)]
*  Interestingly, Israel has not said that it sees a smoking gun from Iran. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  Clearly, nobody wants to get into that kind of war. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=205.78s)]
*  And then Erin, on the humanitarian side, this is also hugely complex, because yes, it is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  closed to all intents and purposes, but I've been speaking to Arab leaders and officials [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=214.02s)]
*  who are very concerned about a quote, Exodus. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=218.88s)]
*  Where are all these Palestinians being pushed from northern Gaza, which is what Israel says [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=221.82s)]
*  it wants to capture? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=226.66s)]
*  Because they do not want to see Palestinians pushed permanently out of Gaza and then potentially [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=228.26s)]
*  never being allowed to come back. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=234.28s)]
*  They also don't want to see that as a precedent. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=236.0s)]
*  What happens if certain Israelis, the right-wingers who want to have always thought, for instance, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=240.18s)]
*  Jordan is a Palestinian homeland, they don't want to see that kind of process happening [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=244.94s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=250.86s)]
*  So this is hugely complicated right now and not as simple. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=251.98s)]
*  Well, it's clearly not simple, but just the idea of humanitarian corridors is also very, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=255.62s)]
*  very complex. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=260.94s)]
*  Right, and strident criticism, vocal criticism of the civilian situation in Gaza from the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=262.94s)]
*  King of Jordan as well as from the leader of Egypt, making it very clear how they feel [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=269.54s)]
*  there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=273.58s)]
*  But Christian, Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State, just came back here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=274.58s)]
*  So he's actually, as you and I are talking, meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=277.46s)]
*  No one had expected him to come back, right? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=281.94s)]
*  He was here at the end of last week, then he decided last night, it was announced last [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=283.44s)]
*  night he would return. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=286.38s)]
*  The question was, what was he returning for? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=287.88s)]
*  Is he returning to try to get Netanyahu to pause or to consider or to pull back? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=289.62s)]
*  Or is he simply coming to assist in negotiations over border crossings? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=295.5s)]
*  We will have a press conference from them in a few moments, but what do you really think [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=300.41999999999996s)]
*  is happening behind those closed doors, Christian? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=303.17999999999995s)]
*  Well, I think all of the above, frankly. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=306.66s)]
*  The United States is trying to keep it from spilling over. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=308.94s)]
*  It has to support Israel's right to self-defense, but it wants to make sure, if it's at all [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=312.42s)]
*  possible, to keep it within certain parameters. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  Also, you know, the United States is implicated. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=320.78000000000003s)]
*  It is involved because 29 at least of its citizens have been killed, and there are apparently [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  potentially Israeli-American hostages. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  So the U.S. is absolutely involved. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=333.98s)]
*  Some people are cautioning. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=336.3s)]
*  You know, the U.S. was asked, would they put boots on the ground, right, in that 60 minutes? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=339.46000000000004s)]
*  And Biden said, don't think it's necessary. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=343.94s)]
*  The U.S. is sending strike forces to the sea around Gaza and around Israel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=346.06s)]
*  What for? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=350.62s)]
*  Is that to cover? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  Is that for covering fire? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=352.86s)]
*  What is it for? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=354.3s)]
*  And just go back all the way to 1983, when the U.S. sent warships outside Lebanon and [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=355.38s)]
*  in support of Israel, was involved in that war. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=361.78000000000003s)]
*  And it had a terrible, terrible backlash against the United States. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=364.9s)]
*  Massive killings at the U.S. military barracks in Beirut and on and on and on. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=368.7s)]
*  It was the beginning of really serious anti-American backlash in that part of the world. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=374.82s)]
*  So that has to be considered as well. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=380.14s)]
*  And and also the hostages, Christiane, I mean, last night, you know, you point out in the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=385.21999999999997s)]
*  60 Minutes interview, President Biden saying no need for U.S. troops on the ground. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=388.97999999999996s)]
*  Of course, John Kirby had had left it on the table that when it comes to U.S. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=392.66s)]
*  hostages, we're not going to take anything off the table as to whether you would need [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=397.02s)]
*  any kind of U.S. military power involved in that in Gaza. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=400.5s)]
*  Now, not taking it off the table isn't the same thing as saying you're going to do it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  But nonetheless, there is still that uncertainty. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=408.74s)]
*  You have Americans being held hostage. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=411.38s)]
*  And that is a whole new thing here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=413.7s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=415.58s)]
*  And as I say, those hostage situations mostly started back there in Lebanon after a certain [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=416.58s)]
*  you know, after what I just told you about. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=423.82s)]
*  The thing is, the hostages, according to Israeli experts and former hostage negotiators and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=426.21999999999997s)]
*  IDF people, they will not be able to be released or found without a ground incursion. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=431.9s)]
*  It's only on the ground that you can get to those hostages. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=439.82s)]
*  You already had a discussion with the Israeli government. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=442.78s)]
*  You already had a discussion about the parameters and the dangers of that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=445.1s)]
*  And the question now is truly the question is, if it's true that some of those hostages [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=448.90000000000003s)]
*  have already been killed in airstrikes and we haven't had confirmation, but that's what [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  Hamas has said. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=457.58000000000004s)]
*  Is Israel's first priority to save the hostages or is it first? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoRBO7Hu9KM&t=459.26000000000005s)]
