# How Israel is responding to Hamas attacks with ‘siege’ on Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A)
*  I want to go now to the maps with CNN Chief National Correspondent Alex Marquardt. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=0.0s)]
*  He's over here at the magic wall with me. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  So Alex, talk to me about where things stand. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=8.28s)]
*  I mean, we were just talking to Anderson about the constant bombardment by the air into Gaza [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  and then from Gaza. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=17.28s)]
*  What are we seeing on the ground as this war now is underway? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=19.46s)]
*  Well, what we're starting to see really, Abby, is that really fierce response that Prime [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=24.12s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu promised with major questions about what happens next. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=27.96s)]
*  This up here is the northern border of Israel with Lebanon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=32.4s)]
*  Major questions right now about whether Hezbollah, another militant group like Hamas that is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=36.56s)]
*  also backed by Iran, whether they get involved in this fight and open up a second front in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  this war. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=45.92s)]
*  We saw missiles being fired by Hezbollah into Israel today after Israel carried out an air [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=46.92s)]
*  strike and killed a small number of Hezbollah fighters. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=51.88s)]
*  The vast majority of what we're seeing is happening down here around Gaza in central [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=55.4s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=60.32s)]
*  I want to zoom in on there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=61.32s)]
*  So what we know now from the Israelis is that they have managed to take back all of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=62.32s)]
*  communities around Gaza that had been attacked by Hamas gunmen. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=66.32s)]
*  This is the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=73.6s)]
*  It is controlled on three sides by Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=75.2s)]
*  There's a naval blockade along the water, but there are two sides that are covered with [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=79.0s)]
*  walls and it's through those fences that those Hamas attackers were able to get out and kill [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=83.84s)]
*  so many people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Again, now the Israelis are saying these southern communities are safe. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  We're starting to see, we have been seeing hundreds and hundreds of air strikes all along [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=96.0s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=100.56s)]
*  As you've noted, the death toll has been growing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=101.56s)]
*  Some 900 Israelis killed so far, almost 700 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  So this is really, first of all, just to point out here, the fronts in this attack [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=109.32s)]
*  over the weekend, it's really extraordinary and unprecedented and it's one of the reasons [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=116.16s)]
*  why this is receiving such a strong response from Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=119.8s)]
*  We have seen some attacks now inside of Gaza. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  This is a very tiny swath of land, but a couple of million people, what are we seeing there? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  Well this is one of the most densely populated places on earth. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=133.68s)]
*  And the big question now is whether the air strikes eventually are evolved into a ground [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=138.12s)]
*  incursion. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=145.28s)]
*  We will certainly continue to see more air strikes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=146.28s)]
*  Our reporting teams have told us that they have seen a buildup of Israeli troops, of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  tanks, of armor personnel carriers, of long range artillery around Gaza. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=153.44s)]
*  The Israelis could very, very quickly build up that force. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=160.56s)]
*  And this is why a ground incursion and continued air strikes could be so deadly because this [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=164.56s)]
*  is so incredibly dense. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=174.28s)]
*  I've been in Gaza during the wars in 2012 and 2014. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=177.28s)]
*  It's a maze of roads, of refugee camps, of high rises, people really packed together. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=184.24s)]
*  We have some two million Palestinians living here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=189.98s)]
*  Around half of them are children in just 140 square miles. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=194.44s)]
*  And so civilians will almost certainly be killed as this Israeli offensive continues. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=199.62s)]
*  And Hamas has now warned that if civilians are killed, if there's no Israeli warning, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=205.2s)]
*  that they will then execute some of the dozens of hostages we know they have on camera and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=210.92s)]
*  then broadcast that, a really chilling message from Hamas. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=217.38s)]
*  Israel has been warning before these attacks. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=219.46s)]
*  Yes, so what Israel says they do are essentially two different things. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=222.38s)]
*  When they carry out these air strikes, and this is some video of some of the hundreds [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=227.14000000000001s)]
*  of air strikes that have been taking place all across Gaza, they do two things. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=231.0s)]
*  One's called a roof knock, where they'll send in essentially what's a small missile that [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=236.02s)]
*  will warn the residents of that building to get out. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  The second thing is, Israelis have a lot of the phone numbers of these Palestinian residents. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=243.32s)]
*  Israel will actually call them, either speak to them or there's a message that plays in [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=248.06s)]
*  Arabic saying, you have a few minutes to get out of the house, you need to evacuate now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=251.6s)]
*  So Israel is saying that that's what they're doing. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=256.98s)]
*  Hamas is claiming that those messages aren't getting through and that Israel is killing [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=259.46s)]
*  civilians. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=265.86s)]
*  There was also an attack, an Israeli attack on a mosque in the last day or so. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=266.86s)]
*  Tell us about what we know about that. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=272.46s)]
*  There have been several, and I want to highlight where we're looking at here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=274.62s)]
*  It's the Al-Shati refugee camp in the northwestern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=277.66s)]
*  So here we have some remarkable befores and afters. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=281.86s)]
*  This is the Al-Susi mosque in that camp. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=286.18s)]
*  You can now see it is just a crater. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  Then there is the Al-Gharbi mosque also in this refugee camp. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  This is a drone image that was taken. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=298.76000000000005s)]
*  That is the before of a satellite image. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  Now obviously completely in ruin, completely destroyed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=304.7s)]
*  And then this is the third mosque, the Yassin mosque in the same refugee camp. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  Why is Israel targeting mosques? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=312.94s)]
*  Well, they claim, as they have in past conflicts, that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=315.34s)]
*  whether it be residential buildings or even mosques, their holiest places, to hide their [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=320.94s)]
*  forces but mainly their weapons. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=326.7s)]
*  Of course, we've seen thousands of missiles being fired into Israel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=328.78s)]
*  So Israel is saying that these mosques in Gaza are legitimate targets. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=332.86s)]
*  Alex Markward, thank you for all of that. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=336.54s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCr6NkCZK9A&t=338.26s)]
