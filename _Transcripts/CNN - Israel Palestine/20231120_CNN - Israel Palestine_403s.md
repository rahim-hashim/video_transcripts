# Hear what college students think about Biden amid Israel-Hamas war
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc)
*  81 today. He made a few jokes about his age during the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=0.0s)]
*  And late tonight, this picture was posted on the president's Instagram account. It's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=5.28s)]
*  a birthday cake ablaze with candles. The comment reads, thanks for the birthday well wishes [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=9.0s)]
*  today everyone. Turns out on your 146th birthday, you run out of space for candles. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=13.36s)]
*  The White House tonight leaning into what is considered one of Biden's biggest political [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  liabilities, his age. Right now, he is showing poorly in the polls, particularly among younger [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=24.64s)]
*  voters. They backed him in 2020 by about 20 points. Polls now show that support collapsing. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=29.98s)]
*  A new one from NBC shows the former president, the former president, Donald Trump leading [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=35.58s)]
*  President Biden 46 to 42 percent among 18 to 34 year olds. What's more, 70 percent of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=40.620000000000005s)]
*  young voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel Hamas war. The White House press [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=47.46s)]
*  secretary was asked about that disapproval today by our MJ Lee. This is what she said. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=52.8s)]
*  What I'll be very clear about is we're going to not going to govern by polls here. We're [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=59.86s)]
*  going to our poll numbers. We're going to focus on delivering for the American people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=63.82s)]
*  That's going to be our focus. The war and young voters are the focus of John King's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=68.54s)]
*  latest installment of his series for 360 all over the map. The series tracks the presidential [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=73.64s)]
*  campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battleground states [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=78.5s)]
*  tonight, Michigan. And John King joins me here now. So John, what did you find out this time? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=82.78s)]
*  Imagine you're back in college or 18, you're 19, you're 20. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=88.06s)]
*  Eighty one seems pretty old and it's not just the number. They think he's just far away [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  from them on the issues. They think he doesn't understand their issues. Even though he's [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=94.9s)]
*  tried to do some things on college debt, they think they don't get it. So age was an issue [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=98.18s)]
*  anyway with this bedrock piece of the Biden coalition. And now, John, when you go to campus, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=101.42s)]
*  you see the protests about the Israel Hamas war on both sides. People raise questions [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  about how the president's handling it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=109.9s)]
*  Midterms are done. Finals just ahead. There is a rhythm to life on campus and this fall, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=111.5s)]
*  a raw divide. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=122.54s)]
*  I am an Israeli, Jewish, Israeli American. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=123.82s)]
*  Maya Siegman is a sophomore at Wayne State in Michigan studying social work, chatting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=126.3s)]
*  with friends here at the Jewish campus organization Hillel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=131.18s)]
*  Hillel is a police officer down the hall. That's not normal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=134.22s)]
*  It is now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=137.7s)]
*  Siegman traveled to Washington last week to join thousands in support of Israel. Now, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=138.94s)]
*  back on a campus divided. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=143.5s)]
*  The division is very clear. The tension on campus is very high. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=145.14s)]
*  Wayne State spans 200 acres in downtown Detroit. Ibrahim Ghazal among the 24,000 students. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=151.1s)]
*  I'm Muslim. I'm American. I'm Palestinian. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=157.74s)]
*  Ghazal calls anti-Semitism horrible and disgusting. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=160.74s)]
*  Do you feel the flip side of it? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=164.3s)]
*  In terms of Islamophobia? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=165.74s)]
*  Yeah, more Islamophobia. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=167.94s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=169.14s)]
*  People just say hurtful things. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=170.14s)]
*  I think it's disgusting that standing up for children dying and women dying and civilian [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=171.14s)]
*  infrastructure being destroyed is being compared to supporting Hamas. I mean, holding up a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=180.5s)]
*  Palestinian flag does not support Hamas. Hamas has their own flag. Nobody's carrying their [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=186.82s)]
*  flag. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=192.1s)]
*  His coffee shop is in Dearborn, where about half of the residents are of Arab ancestry. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=192.98s)]
*  Ghazal and his friends say a president they supported in 2020 is now greenlighting an [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=197.22s)]
*  Israeli response they see as indiscriminate. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=202.98s)]
*  I don't think our country should fund that type of reaction. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=205.22s)]
*  You feel this way? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=209.06s)]
*  To an extent, yes. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  I feel as though President Biden doesn't value my life as a Muslim American as much [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=212.86s)]
*  as he values other lives. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=223.26000000000002s)]
*  Young voters were a giant part of the Biden 2020 coalition, and this urban campus tilts [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=225.3s)]
*  deep blue. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=229.9s)]
*  If it's Biden-Trump next November, you would? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  I'd go Biden. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=233.94000000000003s)]
*  Summer Matkin is just 18, a theater major, an e-sports enthusiast, and an LGBTQ voter [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=235.18s)]
*  who wishes President Biden would yield to someone younger. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  I think that weird generational gap is something that is very, very hard for young people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=244.02s)]
*  So when there's certain things that we want to be heard as young people, you know, with [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=250.26s)]
*  not only the conflict out with Israeli and Palestine people, but we also have student [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=253.58s)]
*  loan forgiveness and all of these different financial problems that aren't being handled [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=258.82s)]
*  when they are very much capable of being handled. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=263.46s)]
*  Matkin isn't ruling out voting third party, but? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=266.54s)]
*  Feels like a weird kind of throwaway vote. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=269.02000000000004s)]
*  Joseph Fisher used to think that way, but right now he favors a socialist party. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=271.3s)]
*  In 2020, Fisher was just 17, but he helped the ACLU register voters back home in Georgia. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=275.90000000000003s)]
*  So you helped Joe Biden get elected? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=281.86s)]
*  I did, yes. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=282.98s)]
*  What about 2024? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=283.98s)]
*  I will not vote for Joe Biden, not this time. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=284.98s)]
*  This is Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan, students writing the names of Palestinians [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=287.68s)]
*  killed in Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  One of our demands that we're pressuring admin for right now is complete divestment from [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=293.54s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=296.74s)]
*  You say genocide. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=297.74s)]
*  The prime minister of Israel or the president of the United States would say response to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=299.62s)]
*  terrorism. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=303.22s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=304.22s)]
*  It's absolutely essential that we call it for what it is a genocide and also say that [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=305.22s)]
*  it doesn't start on October 7th. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=309.42s)]
*  It started in 1948 with the creation of the state of Israel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=311.46000000000004s)]
*  Some Jewish students say talk like that, beliefs like that, are stoking an alarming rise in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=315.1s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=319.94s)]
*  I wish it wasn't like this, but this is what we live right now. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=320.94s)]
*  50,000 students here in Ann Arbor and interest in the College Democrats is up. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=324.74s)]
*  We've had 50, 40, 30 consistently for meetings. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=330.02s)]
*  In the past it has been closer to maybe 10, 15, 20. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=334.94s)]
*  Seniors and co-presidents of the College Democrats, Anoushka Chalasotky and Jade Gray helped generate [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=338.7s)]
*  big turnout here in 2020 and again in 2022. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=343.7s)]
*  They have weekly meetings now to plan 2024. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=346.7s)]
*  Should we have somebody younger? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=350.58s)]
*  Does that come up much? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=351.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=353.18s)]
*  Absolutely it comes up. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=354.62s)]
*  And I think that that's a, you know, it's a real point to make. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=355.62s)]
*  It's a real conversation to be had. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=358.42s)]
*  The immediate challenge though is seeing students who agree on things like abortion rights and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=360.1s)]
*  defending democracy at odds over the Israel Hamas crisis and President Biden's response. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=364.06s)]
*  You know, Mr. President, I've seen you take key humanitarian steps, but I think the next [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=370.5s)]
*  step is a ceasefire. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=376.1s)]
*  And I think that that would go a long way with voters. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=377.9s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen next week or next month. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=380.42s)]
*  If the election were tomorrow, do you think that it is more likely some of your members [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=383.47999999999996s)]
*  would sit out or look for another option, third party, because they're mad at the president [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  about this? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=393.28s)]
*  Some of them, yes, they have shared with us that maybe this is making me reconsider. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=394.28s)]
*  Is it fair to say you're glad the election is not tomorrow? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=397.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pD3Ww6P8jc&t=399.91999999999996s)]
