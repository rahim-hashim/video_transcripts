# Israel’s plan to strike Iran is ready, source says
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY)
*  New indications that Israel's response to an Iranian missile attack will happen sooner [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=0.0s)]
*  rather than later. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Sources are telling CNN American officials expect that retaliation to happen before the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=6.96s)]
*  U.S. election. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=12.4s)]
*  That's less than three weeks away. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=13.4s)]
*  We're also hearing from a source that Israeli officials have their plan of attack ready, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=14.64s)]
*  although Israel has not confirmed that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=19.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, Israel's military has resumed attacks on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon after a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=21.72s)]
*  multi-day pause. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  One of those strikes killing the mayor of a southern Lebanese city. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=27.54s)]
*  CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following all of this for us from Jerusalem. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=31.46s)]
*  So Jeremy, can you just bring us up to date with these new strikes on Beirut and southern [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  Lebanon? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=40.06s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=41.06s)]
*  Well, we are seeing that the Israeli military is continuing to relentlessly pound Lebanon [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=42.06s)]
*  with airstrikes as they say they are going after Hezbollah targets. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=47.46s)]
*  But of course, as we have seen over the course of the last couple of months in particular, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  as Israeli airstrikes have intensified, we are seeing a cost for civilians. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=56.26s)]
*  And one strike in particular today happened in the southern Lebanese town of Nabatiya. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=60.66s)]
*  Six people were killed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=67.46s)]
*  Forty-three others at least have been injured so far in this strike, which actually hit [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=68.82s)]
*  a municipality building and the building housing government administration, according to the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=73.97999999999999s)]
*  Lebanese civil defense. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=80.22s)]
*  One of the six people who were killed was actually this city's mayor. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  The Israeli military for its part says that it was targeting Hezbollah targets in the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=86.98s)]
*  city to dismantle what they claimed was underground infrastructure used by Hezbollah's elite Radwan [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=90.92s)]
*  force. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=97.10000000000001s)]
*  They also are accusing Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields by having that [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=98.10000000000001s)]
*  underground facility beneath homes and civilian buildings in the city of Nabatiya. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=104.16s)]
*  But the results are clear, and that is that civil defense workers are still very much [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=110.06s)]
*  picking through the rubble to determine exactly how many people have been killed, but clearly [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=115.6s)]
*  civilians are among the casualties in the strike. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  And Jeremy, on another front here, I guess, but also related, sources are saying that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=123.8s)]
*  Israel's response to Iran is ready. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=129.24s)]
*  Of course, that response came for strikes led by Iran that came a little bit more than [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=132.68s)]
*  a week ago now. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=138.28s)]
*  Have we heard anything from Israel on that front at all? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=140.48s)]
*  Well, nothing official. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=144.68s)]
*  What we do know is that there have been some really intense conversations between the United [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  States and Israel over exactly the scope and the targets that Israel will hit in the retaliation [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  that it has vowed to carry out for that barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  We have heard President Biden very publicly warning Israel not to target Iranian nuclear [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  facilities, also clearly opposed to strikes on oil facilities. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, we learned, of course, that Israel had privately agreed not to hit those facilities [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=174.24s)]
*  and instead to go after military targets. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=179.24s)]
*  And now we're being told by a source familiar that Israel's response to Iran is indeed ready. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=182.16s)]
*  But the timing is still somewhat unclear. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=187.76s)]
*  The closest that we've been able to get so far from U.S. officials is that it will come [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=190.4s)]
*  before the elections in the United States at the beginning of November, before the presidential [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  election. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=201.04s)]
*  That, of course, raises enormous questions about the extent to which these tensions in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=202.72s)]
*  the Middle East and potentially another round of escalation between Iran and Israel, how [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=208.58s)]
*  that will factor into the presidential election. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=214.62s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, make no mistake, he is very aware of that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=218.74s)]
*  timing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  He is certainly somebody who follows U.S. politics very, very closely and knows very [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  well that the actions that he will take in the coming weeks could have ramifications [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=228.54s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=232.33999999999997s)]
*  The question is exactly how it will actually influence the elections. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=233.33999999999997s)]
*  And that is hard to say right now until we see exactly what these strikes look like and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  what kind of retaliation it draws from Iran. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=241.22s)]
*  Omar. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=243.42s)]
*  Of course. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=244.42s)]
*  We will see. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=245.42s)]
*  Jeremy Diamond in Jerusalem. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=246.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=247.42s)]
*  The Israeli government is reportedly reviewing a letter from the Biden administration demanding [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=248.42s)]
*  it improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza within the next 30 days or risk violating [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  U.S. laws governing foreign military assistance, which suggests potential risk to U.S. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=257.97999999999996s)]
*  military aid. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=262.53999999999996s)]
*  That is as Israel's military presses on with a fierce offensive in northern Gaza. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=263.7s)]
*  The IDF saying today it killed a Hamas commander who led drone operations there, along with [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=269.02s)]
*  dozens more Hamas militants just in the past day. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=273.73999999999995s)]
*  An American surgeon working in southern Gaza tells CNN conditions for civilians across the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=277.29999999999995s)]
*  enclave are getting exponentially worse. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=282.58s)]
*  Well, I can tell you what I've seen in 48 hours and in 48 hours I've seen children coming [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=286.42s)]
*  in with meningitis, 140 kids in this pediatric, you know, when there's only 40 beds, they [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=292.74s)]
*  don't have the appropriate antibiotics, they don't have the appropriate treatment. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=298.54s)]
*  These are just medical medical conditions. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=301.06s)]
*  I'm not even talking about the trauma. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  We have patients coming in who have been untreated for diabetes, which is a very easily treatable [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=304.58000000000004s)]
*  disease who haven't been treated for an entire year because they haven't had access to medications, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=309.22s)]
*  to hygiene, to the actual medical care because it's all been destroyed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=313.54s)]
*  And in the last 48 hours, I've seen so many patients with wound infections on their feet [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=319.70000000000005s)]
*  that have gotten so bad, necrotic, necrotic, gangrenous that they've had to have limb amputations. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=324.86s)]
*  I've done more leg amputations for diabetes than for trauma in the last 48 hours. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=330.46000000000004s)]
*  And so all these things are starting to catch up. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=336.58000000000004s)]
*  And just at an exponential pace, everything is going downhill. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  According to reports, Israel says it is reviewing fresh demands from the Biden administration [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=342.78000000000003s)]
*  that it take immediate steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or risk violating [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  U.S. law. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  Over the weekend, the U.S. gave Israel 30 days to meet its demands, including dramatically [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=356.02s)]
*  increasing the number of aid trucks allowed into the territory. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=360.46000000000004s)]
*  If Israel doesn't comply, it could risk violating U.S. laws on foreign military assistance, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=364.22s)]
*  which could in turn jeopardize U.S. military support in Israel. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=369.14000000000004s)]
*  Humanitarian assistance reaching Palestinians in Gaza has fallen by over 50 percent since [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=373.66s)]
*  its peak, according to the U.S. State Department. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  And last hour, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations was asked about the situation [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=384.3s)]
*  The problem in Gaza is not lack of aid. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=385.3s)]
*  The problem is Hamas, which hijacks the aid, stealing, storing, and selling it to feed [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=389.18s)]
*  their terror machine while civilians suffer. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=396.86s)]
*  Despite all these challenges, Israel continues to uphold international law going above and [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=400.74s)]
*  beyond our obligations. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=407.86s)]
*  Orin Lieberman is at the Pentagon for us. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=411.02000000000004s)]
*  So, Orin, can you just run us through what's at stake here? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=412.86s)]
*  I mean, what are the likely consequences if Israel doesn't comply with the Biden [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=416.7s)]
*  administration's demands? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=420.5s)]
*  What the consequences could be is very stark for Israel. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=422.54s)]
*  The U.S. is the most significant, by far, arms supplier to Israel, providing billions [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=425.78000000000003s)]
*  in aid a year. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=430.98s)]
*  And certainly that number has gone up since the beginning of the conflict one year ago. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=432.42s)]
*  So the administration here in this letter from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=437.26s)]
*  of State Antony Blinken making it quite clear they demand to see, the U.S. that is demands [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=442.1s)]
*  to see improvements in the humanitarian aid going into Gaza, at least 350 trucks a day [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=446.46000000000004s)]
*  going through the four major crossings, as well as the opening of a fifth crossing, and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=452.22s)]
*  more aid on top of that, improvements that the U.S. wants to see within 30 days here. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=456.1s)]
*  The U.S. says this is part of what is required by law. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=461.22s)]
*  That is a continuous review and assessment of whether those receiving U.S. military [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=464.3s)]
*  assistance are abiding by U.S. law regarding that assistance, as well as international [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=470.82s)]
*  humanitarian law. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=475.78s)]
*  Clearly, the administration has repeatedly and quite loudly said Israel isn't doing [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=476.66s)]
*  enough for the humanitarian situation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=481.9s)]
*  They're not buying the argument you just heard put forward there by Israel's ambassador [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=484.46s)]
*  to the U.N. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=487.7s)]
*  An argument Israel has tried to make repeatedly at stake is that the arms supplied to Israel [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=488.7s)]
*  could be restricted. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=493.94s)]
*  We have seen one shipment of 2,000-pound bombs paused. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=495.41999999999996s)]
*  That's been paused for months and remains paused. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=499.46s)]
*  But the threat, the warning here on the table, is that the list of weapons supplied to Israel, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=502.06s)]
*  the list of restrictions on those weapons could grow if more isn't done. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=507.4s)]
*  We're seeing fairly quickly here within 30 days. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=511.22s)]
*  That's the warning given to Israel here. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=513.66s)]
*  That being said, the U.S. also just sent in a THAAD, anti-ballistic missile defense system. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=516.34s)]
*  So the defensive weapons, those are not the question. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=521.38s)]
*  The question is, at least from what we see here, is the offensive weapons that Israel [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=524.58s)]
*  has used to carry out its bombardment of Gaza and now its strikes in Lebanon. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=528.94s)]
*  And I guess on that latter point, I mean, we have seen points where clearly Israel has [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=533.42s)]
*  been in disagreement with the United States, at least at a leadership level over how to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=537.94s)]
*  proceed militarily. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=542.1800000000001s)]
*  And the U.S. has made demands like this or in this nature before, but then has also continued [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=543.7800000000001s)]
*  to supply Israel with weapons and other military support, some of which defensive, as you just [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=548.5s)]
*  mentioned. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=553.86s)]
*  So is this letter any different from what we've seen previously in this war? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=554.86s)]
*  That's an excellent question. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=561.58s)]
*  This letter is certainly a more significant step than we have seen the administration [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=562.58s)]
*  take to this point. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=566.38s)]
*  So perhaps that signals a change in thinking here and there will be more political will [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=567.9399999999999s)]
*  to restrict arms to Israel because we haven't really seen that in the past. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=573.18s)]
*  Even with the warnings on the humanitarian aid situation, all that's been held is this [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=577.98s)]
*  shipment of 2,000-pound bombs. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=582.02s)]
*  So it is therefore then a question of political will. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=584.58s)]
*  It's worth noting that the 30 days that the U.S. has given Israel here to fix this problem [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=587.62s)]
*  is after, that deadline is after the U.S. election. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=592.14s)]
*  Is there more political will after the election? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=595.7s)]
*  That's the true question here. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=598.5400000000001s)]
*  And that's what we will have to wait to see here because you're absolutely right to point [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=600.6600000000001s)]
*  out that despite these repeated warnings and very public warnings and open warnings in [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=603.74s)]
*  the past, the U.S. hasn't really restricted the supply of weapons to Israel in any significant [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=607.58s)]
*  way. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=611.86s)]
*  And you do bring up a good point that after the U.S. election, the posturing either from [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=612.86s)]
*  or at least the perception of what the future of the United States foreign policy is could [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=617.34s)]
*  shift dramatically depending on who's elected there. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=621.86s)]
*  Warren Lieberman at the Pentagon. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=625.3s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFhVFZMcXRY&t=626.74s)]
