# Israeli soldier records himself blowing up a mosque
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No)
*  Inside Israel, people are seeing a very different picture of the war [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=0.0s)]
*  from the rest of the world and from what you've just heard, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=3.96s)]
*  with IDF soldiers documenting their military offensive in real time. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=7.28s)]
*  Correspondent Jeremy Diamond reports on this trend unfolding on social media. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=11.72s)]
*  This is a how-to video on how to blow up a mosque in Gaza. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Format is internet fluent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=26.44s)]
*  The content is very real, filmed, edited and posted on Instagram by an Israeli soldier. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=28.8s)]
*  It's one of dozens reviewed by CNN. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=36.08s)]
*  For many, in 2024, social media is everyday life. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=38.72s)]
*  Israeli soldiers are no different, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=43.4s)]
*  except they're fighting Israel's largest and most brutal war in decades. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=45.72s)]
*  In video... [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  After video... [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=54.04s)]
*  After video... [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=56.6s)]
*  Soldiers document the destruction of Gaza and rejoice. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  They film detonations to use as wedding invitations. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Among them are would-be comedians, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=72.16s)]
*  whose videos satirizing the war show the devastation in Gaza. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=74.52s)]
*  This was the university. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=79.2s)]
*  The IDF helped them, it's a safe university. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  Soldiers have always documented themselves. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=87.04s)]
*  It could be in journals, it could be with, you know, taking pictures. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=90.84s)]
*  Avner Gvar Yahu served in the IDF during the Second Intifada. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=97.12s)]
*  He leads the group, Breaking the Silence, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=101.44s)]
*  which encourages soldiers to speak out about the realities of occupation. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=103.88s)]
*  Even if we do find, you know, the why we went to this war important, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=108.24s)]
*  significant and necessity, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=114.08s)]
*  we have to ask ourselves how we're conducting ourselves in wartime. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=116.84s)]
*  The videos often end up on the social media channels [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=122.2s)]
*  of right-wing political commentators. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  They boast to the Israeli public of the tactics used to defend them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=127.6s)]
*  The IDF told CNN that it has acted and continues to act to identify unusual cases [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=131.68s)]
*  that deviate from what is expected of IDF soldiers. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  Those cases will be arbitrated and significant command measures [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=141.44s)]
*  will be taken against the soldiers involved. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=145.16s)]
*  Images from Gaza of Israel's war injured are rare on Israeli television. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=149.08s)]
*  But they're there on TikTok. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=154.32s)]
*  The overarching theme is there to show that the Israeli soldiers [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=156.28s)]
*  The overarching theme is that, you know, we're here, we're going to win, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=160.23999999999998s)]
*  we're powerful enough. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=164.6s)]
*  And I think that what these soldiers are doing, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=166.2s)]
*  all these clips that we see on social media, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=168.76s)]
*  is part of an attempt to regain sense of agency, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=172.88s)]
*  regain sense of power, regain, you know, the sense of positive self-image, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=177.68s)]
*  the way we talk about ourselves before October 7. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=183.72s)]
*  At times, they openly defy their military's message about protecting civilians. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=188.8s)]
*  And film themselves destroying civilian shops. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=198.24s)]
*  Israel is under increasing scrutiny over the war in Gaza. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=205.96s)]
*  These videos may well be adding fuel to that criticism. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=210.16s)]
*  Just in to CNN, the IDF says it's detained more than 20 people [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=218.48s)]
*  suspected of taking part in the October 7 attacks [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=223.04s)]
*  as its raid of the largest functioning hospital in Gaza continues. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=226.08s)]
*  The Israeli military also says it found weapons inside the facility, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  but CNN hasn't been able to independently verify that photograph. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=233.44s)]
*  The IDF, though, says the mission inside the hospital is still ongoing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=237.24s)]
*  I want to get to CNN's Nick Robertson, who is live in Tel Aviv for us. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=241.44s)]
*  So, Nick, what more are you learning? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=245.04s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of things about the hospital we're learning. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=248.84s)]
*  From the World Health Organization, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=251.84s)]
*  say they are trying to work with the Israeli authorities [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=253.84s)]
*  to get access to the hospital and stabilise the situation there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=257.24s)]
*  According to hospital authorities, electricity in the ICU unit [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  and possibly oxygen supply there as well are in critical condition, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  and this could threaten the lives of several patients [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=274.04s)]
*  and infants that are within the ICU, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=276.24s)]
*  the critical care unit at the hospital there. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=280.24s)]
*  But to what the IDF is saying, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=282.24s)]
*  that they have now rounded up 20 suspects, they say, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=284.24s)]
*  who were involved in the October 7 attacks. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=288.24s)]
*  They've released photographs of a few of them [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=291.24s)]
*  that we cannot independently ourselves verify were involved [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=294.24s)]
*  in the October 7 attacks. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=299.24s)]
*  The IDF described one of them as an ambulance driver, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=300.24s)]
*  again, something we can't verify. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=304.24s)]
*  The IDF originally went into the hospital, they said, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=305.24s)]
*  because they had credible intelligence [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=308.24s)]
*  that there were possibly the bodies of hostages there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=310.24s)]
*  They had this intelligence, they say, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=313.24s)]
*  from their sources and from other hostages. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=315.24s)]
*  The IDF point to the fact that hostages have been held in hospitals before, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=318.24s)]
*  and according to hospital officials at the NASA hospital, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=322.24s)]
*  the IDF were digging up bodies in some of the temporary graves [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=326.24s)]
*  that have been dug inside the hospital to check those bodies. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=329.24s)]
*  But later in the day, yesterday, Thursday, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=332.24s)]
*  the IDF said that they were becoming aware [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=334.24s)]
*  that there could be terror operatives [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=337.24s)]
*  hiding amongst the displaced people within the hospital. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=339.24s)]
*  And they began to filter out the displaced people from the hospital, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=343.24s)]
*  taking into custody those suspects. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=347.24s)]
*  And now they say 20 suspects involved October 7 [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=349.24s)]
*  have now been rounded up from that hospital. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=353.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, Nick Robertson, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=356.24s)]
*  I'm going to continue to follow those updates. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=357.24s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D3uQbiE8No&t=359.24s)]
