# Hear from father who thought daughter was killed in Hamas attack, and now told she may be alive
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c)
*  It's a heart-wrenching story. CNN has been following the father of an eight-year-old girl since he was relieved when he was told his daughter was killed in the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel because he believed being held hostage would be a worse fate than death. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=0.0s)]
*  But now Israeli officials tell him his daughter is most likely kidnapped and is still alive in Gaza. CNN's Ed Lavandera joins us now from Tel Aviv. Ed, my heart sank when I saw this update. What are you hearing from the father right now? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=13.0s)]
*  Well, Thomas Hand says that family and friends can only console him with a hug and the words, there are no words. But Thomas Hand found the words when he spoke with us. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=28.0s)]
*  From the morning of the 7th till now is a nightmare roller coaster tragedy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=41.0s)]
*  The anguish Thomas Hand is about to describe has left him trembling for weeks. It's a journey of death and a hope of resurrection, he says, is impossible to imagine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=52.0s)]
*  On the day it was a Russian roulette, whether you made it or not. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=63.0s)]
*  On October 7th, Hamas fighters stormed the Kibbutz Be'eri, killing roughly 130 people and ravaging the community of 1,100 residents. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=67.0s)]
*  That morning, Thomas' 8-year-old daughter, Emily, was sleeping at her friend's house. Thomas could not reach her as Hamas fighters took over the Kibbutz. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=76.0s)]
*  Days after the attack, the Irish-born father spoke with CNN's Clarissa Ward about the moment he was told his daughter had been killed. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=86.0s)]
*  Thomas waited two agonizing days before getting the news. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=94.0s)]
*  They just said, we found Emily. She's dead. And I went, yes! I went, yes! And smiled. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=98.0s)]
*  Because that is the best news of the possibilities that I knew. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=117.0s)]
*  She'd be in a dark room filled with Christ knows how many people and terrified every minute, hour, day and possible years to come. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=122.0s)]
*  So death was a blessing, an absolute blessing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=134.0s)]
*  Thomas says leaders of the Be'eri Kibbutz community told him Emily's body was seen in the aftermath. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=140.0s)]
*  But almost a month after the massacre, Thomas was given news that almost made him collapse. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=146.0s)]
*  He says the Israeli army told him it's highly probable Emily is alive and a Hamas hostage. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=152.0s)]
*  How were you told the news that Emily might be alive? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=159.0s)]
*  That was official from the army. With all the information that they have, the intelligence that they have, it's very likely that she's been taken to Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=161.0s)]
*  Thomas says he's been told Emily's body is not with the remains of victims and that there was no blood found inside the home where she slept the night before. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=181.0s)]
*  Thomas also says that cell phones belonging to the family Emily was staying with have been tracked inside Gaza. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=188.0s)]
*  When you spoke with Clarissa Ward a few weeks ago, you said death would be a blessing in this situation. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=196.0s)]
*  That's how I felt at the time, yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=202.0s)]
*  How do you describe where you are now? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=204.0s)]
*  Extremely worried about her, obviously. What conditions she's been held in. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=206.0s)]
*  She's more than likely in a tunnel somewhere under Gaza. Your imagination is horrible. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=211.0s)]
*  And it's her birthday on the 17th of this month. She'll be nine. She won't even know what day it is. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=221.0s)]
*  She won't know what day it is. She won't know it's her birthday. There'll be no birthday cake, no party, no friends. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=231.0s)]
*  She'll just be petrified in a tunnel under Gaza. That's her birthday. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=241.0s)]
*  Thomas is now flooded with the hope and the despair of what his daughter might be enduring. He prays she can somehow hear these words to her. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=250.0s)]
*  If Emily is watching, just to let her know that we love her, all of us, we're all waiting for her to come back safely. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=260.0s)]
*  The survivors of the Be'erikah boots are temporarily living in a hotel. In the lobby, there's a vigil to all the kidnapped hostages. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=273.0s)]
*  Now Emily's family says the young girl's photo will be placed next to the others. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=281.0s)]
*  You described as being a hostage as worse than death. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=286.0s)]
*  I believe so. The unknown is awful. The waiting is awful. But that's what we've got to do now. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=291.0s)]
*  Just pray and hope that she comes back in some broken state, but we can fix her. We'll fix her somehow. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=299.0s)]
*  Do you allow yourself now to think about holding Emily again? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=310.0s)]
*  I can see her in my head. I can see, you know, like a beach scene, her running to me and me running to her. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=316.0s)]
*  Just picking her up. Never letting her go. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=325.0s)]
*  And Phil and Poppy, remarkably, Thomas Hans says he feels no anger about this roller coaster of emotions that he's been on. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=332.0s)]
*  He believes that the leaders in the kibbutz there simply were doing their best in those harrowing early days of this attack. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=339.0s)]
*  So he harbors no ill will. He is not angry right now. His focus is solely on getting his daughter back. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=347.0s)]
*  And he is grateful for the outpouring of love and support that he's getting from countless people here in his country and from around the world. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=353.0s)]
*  Ed Lavendaura, not the update we wanted, but hopes and prayers for sure. Thank you very much. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMBIHdNqG_c&t=360.0s)]
