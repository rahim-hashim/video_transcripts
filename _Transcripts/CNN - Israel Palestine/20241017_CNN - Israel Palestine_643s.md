# Israeli military investigating whether Hamas leader was killed during military operation
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4)
*  We are following breaking news right now. The Israeli military is investigating whether the leader of Hamas, Yaya Sinwar, was killed in a strike in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel considers him the mastermind behind the October 7th terror attacks. Let's get right into this. Let's go straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=9.0s)]
*  Jeremy, what more are you learning? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=18.0s)]
*  Well, Jim, this would be an earth-shattering development if indeed it is confirmed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=22.0s)]
*  The Israeli military says that they have killed what they describe as three terrorists in the Gaza Strip, one of whom they believe may be Hamas's leader, Yaya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7th attacks that set off this year-long war inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=27.0s)]
*  The Israeli military is saying in a statement that, quote, the identity of the terrorists cannot yet be confirmed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=45.0s)]
*  They are also saying that this apparently happened in a building above ground in Gaza, which is extremely notable given the fact that the working assumption had been that Sinwar was hiding in tunnels for much of the last year. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=50.0s)]
*  They also say that there are, quote, no signs of the presence of hostages in the area. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=63.0s)]
*  Now, Sinwar has been, of course, a central figure in this war over the course of the last year. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=68.0s)]
*  Not only did he greenlight the October 7th attack that set off this war that has now seen 1,200 Israeli civilians killed on that day, on October 7th, 1,200 Israelis, I should say, sorry, the majority of whom were civilians, but also, of course, more than 41,000 Palestinians have now died in the Gaza Strip, killed for sure by Israeli bombs and bullets. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=74.0s)]
*  But make no mistake that Sinwar also bears some share of responsibility for launching this war. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=97.0s)]
*  And certainly we have seen growing expressions of anger, including by Gazan civilians who have increasingly blamed Sinwar in the aftermath of Israeli airstrikes for the continued suffering as they believe that he was hiding underground. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=103.0s)]
*  We will see how this actually impacts the continuation of this war and, of course, beyond that, whether or not this could perhaps make ceasefire and hostage negotiations easier to actually achieve or whether instead the chaos that is likely to follow within Hamas following his potential death, whether or not that will make the situation worse. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=119.0s)]
*  Jim. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=139.0s)]
*  All right, Jeremy Diamond, keep us posted. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=140.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=142.0s)]
*  We've got a lot of people to talk to about this. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=143.0s)]
*  Let me bring in CNN political and global affairs analyst Barack Ravid. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=146.0s)]
*  Barack, your sense of things right now, obviously, as Jeremy was saying a few moments ago, there are massive implications if Sinwar is indeed dead. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=150.0s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=161.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's it's highly likely that he is, you know, there's no official statement by the IDF yet, but all the people I talked to say that he's dead. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=162.0s)]
*  There are pictures of his body. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=174.0s)]
*  I think everybody who takes a look at those pictures, it's clear to him that it's him. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=176.0s)]
*  We're just waiting for the official statement. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=180.0s)]
*  And, you know, he has seen war was the mastermind of the October 7th attack. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=182.0s)]
*  He is the one that decided to do it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=189.0s)]
*  He is the one that launched this attack that killed 1200, 1200 people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=192.0s)]
*  Most of the civilians kidnapped 150 people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=197.0s)]
*  Forty three Americans were killed in this attack. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=200.0s)]
*  Twelve Americans were taken hostage. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=203.0s)]
*  This attack led to the most devastating war in not only in Gaza's history, but in the history of the Palestinian people with more than 40000 people dead, most of them civilians. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=206.0s)]
*  And it all happened because of a decision of one man to launch this attack. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=219.0s)]
*  So I think that this is, you know, again, we still I still want to say that there's a slightest chance that maybe it's not him, although I don't think so. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=226.0s)]
*  But, you know, if he's indeed dead, this is a dramatic moment for this war and a dramatic moment for the region. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=235.0s)]
*  And it opens up the way for hopefully ending the war and moving on a new direction. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=244.0s)]
*  And Barack, yes, we all remember the horrendous images that came out of the October 7th attack. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=251.0s)]
*  I mean, it's going to be impossible, I think, for anyone really to erase those images from their minds anytime soon. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=257.0s)]
*  And I'm just curious, what kind of pressure does this put on the Israeli government to perhaps wind things down? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=265.0s)]
*  Is there any appetite with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, to do just that? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=273.0s)]
*  What's your sense of that? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=279.0s)]
*  My sense is that Netanyahu waited for exactly that moment for this, you know, victory picture, at least in Gaza. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=282.0s)]
*  When you take out Yechia Sinwar, you can say I won, even though Hamas hasn't been wiped out. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=293.0s)]
*  It still exists. The situation in Gaza is super, super problematic for Israel. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=301.0s)]
*  And there's no day after, realistic day after plan. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=308.0s)]
*  But for Netanyahu politically, in Israeli politics, inside his coalition, he can now say we won. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=313.0s)]
*  And therefore we're ready to move on to and on another path, on a hostage deal, on ending the war, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=321.0s)]
*  on trying to find a political solution to the current situation and not just continue on with this perpetual war. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=328.0s)]
*  And let me bring in CNN's Alex Marquardt. He is in studio with me. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=336.0s)]
*  Alex, I mean, you followed this very closely. I mean, this has big implications on a diplomatic front as well. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=341.0s)]
*  I mean, we know the president right now is traveling. He has the Secretary of State Tony Blinken with him. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=349.0s)]
*  He has the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=353.0s)]
*  And one of the things that we have heard time and again from Secretary Blinken through all of this is that one of the big impediments [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=356.0s)]
*  to getting some kind of deal that would release the hostages and perhaps start bringing this thing towards a ceasefire and a conclusion is Sinwar. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=362.0s)]
*  He's been pretty, I mean, as much as there's criticism for Prime Minister Netanyahu, Blinken has made it very clear Sinwar has been a huge obstacle in all of this. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=371.0s)]
*  Yeah, when you listen to U.S. officials, particularly in the last few weeks, talk about the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=379.0s)]
*  they essentially put Netanyahu and Sinwar on equal footing, saying it's not clear whether either of them has the political willingness to strike a deal. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=385.0s)]
*  Now, you will often hear U.S. officials say that Hamas really is the impediment. Hamas has been changing the terms. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=394.0s)]
*  We know that Netanyahu has also been changing the terms. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=400.0s)]
*  Now, if Sinwar is off of the battlefield, a lot of the onus moves to Netanyahu. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=403.0s)]
*  And he has a moment here, U.S. officials believe, where he can declare victory. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=410.0s)]
*  He can say we have decimated Hamas. We've taken 14,000, 15,000 of their fighters off of the battlefield. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=415.0s)]
*  We've taken out their highest political and military echelon. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=421.0s)]
*  It wouldn't just be Sinwar, it would be the head of the military wing, Mohammed Daif and his deputy Marwan Issa. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=425.0s)]
*  So U.S. officials who I've been speaking with this morning, no doubt see this as a moment where they could jumpstart the ceasefire negotiations [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=430.0s)]
*  that have been completely stalled in the water for the past few weeks. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=439.0s)]
*  And more importantly, Jim, for months the U.S. administration has seen the end of the war in Gaza, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=442.0s)]
*  a ceasefire in Gaza, as the key to unlocking so much more, not just getting the Israeli hostages home, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=449.0s)]
*  not just getting that critical aid into the Gaza Strip for the hundreds of thousands of people who are suffering so much in Gaza, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=455.0s)]
*  but also ending the confrontations that Israel is facing with Hezbollah to the north in Lebanon, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=463.0s)]
*  the increasing attacks by the Houthis in Yemen, as well as other proxy groups. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=469.0s)]
*  So this really is a, could be, could be a pivotal moment for not just the war in Gaza, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=473.0s)]
*  but so much of these growing and brewing conflicts across the region. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=481.0s)]
*  Yeah, and not to mention the tensions with Iran as well, which has been on the rise, of course. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=485.0s)]
*  And CNN's Arlette Sines is over at the White House for us. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=489.0s)]
*  And Arlette, if you can pick up on that point from Alex Marquardt, because it's an important one, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=492.0s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said at the outset of all of this that one of the goals was to crush Hamas. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=496.0s)]
*  Taking out Sinwar obviously gets him to that goal by and large. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=502.0s)]
*  What might be the domestic political implications in all of this? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=507.0s)]
*  It sounds like the White House is saying that they see this as a goalpost for Netanyahu and for the Israelis. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=511.0s)]
*  Yeah, U.S. officials have long viewed the potential death of Hamas leader Yahu-Yah Sinwar as a potential game changer [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=518.0s)]
*  and their best chance to potentially bring an end to this conflict in Gaza, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=525.0s)]
*  but also trying to tame some of the other tensions in the Middle East. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=529.0s)]
*  Now, so far the White House has yet to say anything publicly. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=533.0s)]
*  They are likely waiting to see if the IDF does confirm that they killed Sinwar in operations within Gaza, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=536.0s)]
*  but it would have major implications for the Biden administration [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=544.0s)]
*  as they have spent the better part of the last year trying to find an end to this conflict. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=548.0s)]
*  Now, officials have long viewed Sinwar as one of the major obstacles to achieving a ceasefire and hostage release deal. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=553.0s)]
*  Just on Tuesday, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby had said that there were no fresh negotiations underway [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=562.0s)]
*  and that Sinwar had shown no signs of wanting to have any serious discussions on this matter. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=569.0s)]
*  So officials will be watching this confirmation if it comes very closely [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=575.0s)]
*  and also trying to determine what it means not just for the war in Gaza, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=580.0s)]
*  but also for the broader attention in the Middle East. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=584.0s)]
*  But it also does come at a time when the situation in the Middle East [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=587.0s)]
*  and specifically the war in Gaza has been a major political issue in this 2024 campaign. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=591.0s)]
*  It dogged President Biden as he was running, and it's now an issue the Vice President Kamala Harris continues to face [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=597.0s)]
*  as there has been growing discontent among some people, including young voters, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=603.0s)]
*  Arab American and Muslim American voters about the administration's handling in this conflict. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=608.0s)]
*  So we will see how exactly a potential death of Sinwar might play in the political season. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=614.0s)]
*  But certainly this is something that the White House and officials across the administration will be watching closely. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=620.0s)]
*  President Biden is on a plane to Germany for about the next six hours. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=625.0s)]
*  He's on that plane with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=630.0s)]
*  Certainly they will be receiving updates throughout the day as they are waiting to hear if Israel is able to confirm that they have killed Sinwar. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP70jel3hC4&t=635.0s)]
