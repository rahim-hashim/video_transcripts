# Flags burned, monuments graffitied and US flags replaced with Palestinian ones by protesters
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho)
*  Jonathan, you came from this address. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=0.0s)]
*  You were in the hall in the House chamber. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  What was your impression of the speech knowing that he had multiple audiences there? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=6.92s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty extraordinary, Diana. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  I mean, to be there in the chamber watching Prime Minister Netanyahu deliver those remarks [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  were a few things that stood out for me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=19.36s)]
*  Number one, it was a unity message. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=21.32s)]
*  Like literally you had Democrats and Republicans standing up and applauding. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=23.56s)]
*  I thought there was going to be lots of empty seats. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=28.2s)]
*  There simply weren't. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=30.36s)]
*  It was a pretty full house. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=31.52s)]
*  And he complimented President Biden and praised him, as Jamie said. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=33.68s)]
*  And he complimented President Trump for the Abraham Accord. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=36.72s)]
*  So he was sort of finding a way to praise both sides. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=38.76s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=42.36s)]
*  Number two, he talked about anti-Semitism. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=43.36s)]
*  He talked about what's happening on our college campuses and what's happening in the streets [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=45.96s)]
*  and how that is not just about protesting policies of the government. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=49.56s)]
*  You're seeing people going after Zionists and Jews. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=53.2s)]
*  And literally while he was speaking outside the Capitol, you had people burning American [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  flags in front of Union Station. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=61.28s)]
*  I saw signs as I came over here to the studio, people saying things like, any resistance [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=64.36s)]
*  is justified. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=69.8s)]
*  I mean, comparing that kind of language, when you think about the babies who were burned [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=70.8s)]
*  and the women who were raped. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=76.56s)]
*  So he talked about that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=78.32s)]
*  That was important. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=79.4s)]
*  And then thirdly, I think he laid out a path forward. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=80.6s)]
*  He talked about hostages and the needs to get them home. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=83.12s)]
*  He talked about what a future could look like for Israel and a demilitarized Gaza, like [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=85.56s)]
*  a vision of peace. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=89.84s)]
*  That to me was really quite welcome. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=91.12s)]
*  But there were a lot of, dozens of Democrats boycotted the speech. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=92.12s)]
*  Didn't show up a lot of those seats where the Democrats would have been seated, where [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=95.72s)]
*  congressional staffers just showing up and sitting there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=99.4s)]
*  You know, there may have been some empties, but I watched Hakeem Jeffrey stand and applaud. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=102.16s)]
*  I watched Chuck Schumer stand and applaud. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=106.04s)]
*  I watched almost every Democratic senator stand and applaud. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=108.0s)]
*  So I hear what you're saying, but I got to say, I saw unity in that room. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=111.36s)]
*  I saw him try to appeal to both sides and I saw people from both parties respond. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  What you do at the ADL is try to stamp out hate. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=120.08s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=124.16s)]
*  Anti-Semitism, hate against Islamophobia, racism, all of it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=125.16s)]
*  How do you think that Netanyahu's attempt to do that in his speech is going to play? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=131.24s)]
*  I mean, I was getting a text from one American Jew who said, okay, it's fine to call people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  useful idiots, but how about like a slight nod to people who are genuinely upset about [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=144.44s)]
*  what's happening in Gaza? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=151.2s)]
*  And understanding that you're also seeing the signs that you just described, which is [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=153.44s)]
*  just plain hate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=157.64s)]
*  And he talked about the director of national intelligence acknowledging a few weeks ago [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=158.88s)]
*  that Iran is involved in these protests, something we've been seeing at ADL for a long time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=163.0s)]
*  But he did something very interesting, Deanna, before the speech really got started. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=167.4s)]
*  He called out some of the folks that he had brought over as part of his delegation, including, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=171.8s)]
*  for example, a Bedouin soldier, which was interesting because I think most Americans [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=176.12s)]
*  don't realize there are Israeli Muslims in the IDF. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=180.56s)]
*  And then he had an Ethiopian Israeli soldier who ran eight miles on October the 7th. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=184.4s)]
*  So I point this out because he demonstrated the diversity of Israeli society. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=190.28s)]
*  I think you pointed this out earlier, in a way that surprised a lot of people. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  He could have come with just decorated Jewish veterans. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=197.68s)]
*  He didn't do that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=200.44000000000003s)]
*  He brought a more diverse delegation, and I think that sends a message. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=202.84s)]
*  Just to push back just a little bit about all the unity, you know, several Israelis [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  from both sides of the aisle were texting me during the speech. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  And what I heard from them is that that was, in effect, a very celebratory speech that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  really does not fit and that there is an alternate reality on the ground that's going on both [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  in Gaza and in Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=230.84s)]
*  As we know, in the north, 60,000-plus Israelis are displaced. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=232.44s)]
*  There has been an extraordinary impact on the economy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  And then, of course, there is the devastating reality of the number of deaths in Gaza, Palestinians, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  the humanitarian disaster. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  So he had a welcome audience there today, but he did ignore what I'm hearing from Israelis [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=250.96s)]
*  is a very dire reality on the ground. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=260.8s)]
*  Look, there is no question that that is an incredibly difficult situation. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=264.8s)]
*  And every civilian life lost is a tragedy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Every Palestinian woman or child who was killed inadvertently, no matter what the IDF tries [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=272.44s)]
*  to do, that is a tragedy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=277.68s)]
*  We should mourn every one of those deaths. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=279.08s)]
*  But he talked about, for example, the dire situation in Gaza and how they're trying to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=281.96s)]
*  bring in supplies. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=287.0s)]
*  He talked about the situation in the north, like you're pointing out, and the need to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=288.24s)]
*  bring those people back to their homes, 60,000 or 80,000 Israelis. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  And he talked about the need to bring the hostages home. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=295.52s)]
*  I know at ADL, again, we're folks fighting hate here at home, but we all wear the dog [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=298.56s)]
*  tags because we want these civilians, these innocent people back, including, by the way, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=302.8s)]
*  I think maybe it's eight Americans at this point. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=308.48s)]
*  So I think he tried to address that, Jamie, but look, if you've lost a child, if you're [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=311.2s)]
*  I think about my friends, the Polans, I was with the Nurches before we came on, their [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=315.96s)]
*  sons are both held in Gaza. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=320.2s)]
*  I can't even begin to grasp the unspeakable pain they deal with every day. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=322.32s)]
*  We have got to get those kids home. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=327.28s)]
*  So I hope they get a deal very fast so we can see Omer and we can see Hirsch back home [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=329.3s)]
*  safe and sound and all the hostages once and for all. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=336.44s)]
*  So there's a deal that will bring those hostages home as quickly as possible. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=339.04s)]
*  Jonathan Greenblatt, thanks very much, Jamie. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=343.2s)]
*  Thanks to you as well. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=345.16s)]
*  I want to go see it as Miguel Marquez. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=346.92s)]
*  He's been covering the demonstrators out there in the streets of Washington. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=349.04s)]
*  Jamie, give us a sense of what's been going on. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=353.0s)]
*  Lots and lots of demonstrators and protesters throughout the Capitol, around the Capitol [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=359.0s)]
*  building. But I want to show you, all over here at Union Station. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=362.92s)]
*  This is the remnants of one US flag that was burned here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=366.16s)]
*  Over in the distance there you can see the ashes there. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=369.52000000000004s)]
*  That's the remnants of another flag. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=372.16s)]
*  I want to show you sort of the bell over here, though, the Liberty, the copy of the Liberty [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  Bell that's out in front of the station. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=377.54s)]
*  That's been covered in graffiti. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=380.46000000000004s)]
*  And then the Columbus Memorial has also been covered in graffiti here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=382.16s)]
*  And Jonathan, if you could show all three US flags on the three flagpoles, massive flagpoles [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=386.04s)]
*  out in front of Union Station have been pulled down and Palestinian flags have been put up [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=390.44000000000005s)]
*  in their place. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=395.04s)]
*  Most of the protesters, there's a few dozen, maybe a hundred or so still gathered here. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=396.88s)]
*  Most of the protesters have left. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=401.28s)]
*  But you can see the number of police officers in front of Union Station. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=402.96s)]
*  And I'm looking over across the way here and there are lots of police with shields now [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=406.56s)]
*  and heavy vehicles. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=412.0s)]
*  So it looks like most of the protesters are leaving and police will come back in and bring [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=413.28s)]
*  this place back to order. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=417.64s)]
*  Wolf. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=419.16s)]
*  All right, Miguel, let's hope it's peaceful over there. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=420.16s)]
*  Miguel Marquez reporting for us. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=422.04s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=423.6s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  And with us now is Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=426.20000000000005s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for being here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=430.32000000000005s)]
*  Really great to see you and to have you here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=432.20000000000005s)]
*  First, generally speaking, your reaction to Prime Minister Netanyahu's remarks. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  Strong speech and as is usually the case with the prime minister, very well articulated. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  And I thought he hit all the right points, Dan. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=447.76000000000005s)]
*  And I think the one thing that he needs to do for people in this country and for that [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=450.04s)]
*  matter people all around the world is connect the dots back to Iran. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=453.44s)]
*  And the fact that Israel is the only thing standing between Iran and the United States, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=458.08s)]
*  which they consider to be the great Satan. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=463.04s)]
*  And so Iran is behind all the malign activities in that region, whether it's Hezbollah in [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=465.32s)]
*  the north or the Houthis in Yemen or Hamas right there in the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=470.6s)]
*  But I thought he was really effective in that in particular and also articulating a vision [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=475.88s)]
*  of what it could look like in the future if you had an integrated Middle East and a [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=480.4s)]
*  de-radicalized, demilitarized Gaza. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=485.2s)]
*  And that of course means that you've got to get rid and eliminate Hamas. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=489.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to get back to what you were just talking about and back to the prime minister's speech [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=492.79999999999995s)]
*  in a second. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=497.23999999999995s)]
*  I'm not sure if you were able to hear our reporter Miguel Marquez, who was talking about [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=498.23999999999995s)]
*  the protesters outside. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=502.52s)]
*  Specifically, he was reporting on and showing the American flag being lowered, the Palestinian [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=504.12s)]
*  flag being raised. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=509.36s)]
*  We even saw some red triangles. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  We're showing it now. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=513.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you can see it, but we even saw some red triangles on some of the statues. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=514.8000000000001s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=520.76s)]
*  Well I think it's disgraceful, it's shameful, and the kind of thing that we shouldn't see [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=522.44s)]
*  in this country. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=528.2s)]
*  But again, as the prime minister pointed out today, a lot of these activities that are [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=529.2s)]
*  happening here in the United States, Iran is behind them. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=533.1s)]
*  They are trying to create tumult and instability and chaos and use and fueling all these protests [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=536.32s)]
*  and the violence, particularly the anti-Semitic violence in this country. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=544.2s)]
*  That's Iranian activity. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=548.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's why they have to be stopped. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=549.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's why it's so important that we continue to support Israel, including, as the prime [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=551.88s)]
*  minister said, give us the tools faster and we will finish the job. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=556.0400000000001s)]
*  They've got to get this thing over with and send a clear statement to the world that this [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=560.72s)]
*  kind of behavior and the kind of thing that we're seeing right here in the U.S. and right [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=566.6s)]
*  here in this city today just can't be tolerated. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=569.9s)]
*  Senator, one of Prime Minister Netanyahu's predecessors, Ehud Barak, who we understand [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=573.5600000000001s)]
*  and we should tell our viewers who might not know, is not from the same party as Prime [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=583.88s)]
*  But nonetheless, he's somebody who has been intimately involved in trying to get to peace. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=586.04s)]
*  He almost got there when Bill Clinton had him and Yasser Arafat in 2000 here in the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=591.48s)]
*  United States. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=596.12s)]
*  He said very, very strongly and very clearly to Wolf that he does not believe that Prime [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=597.48s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu actually wants to end the war because it would mean the end of his own [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=604.56s)]
*  political viability at home. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=609.8199999999999s)]
*  That might even mean that hostages stay longer. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=612.44s)]
*  Are you concerned about, I mean you're a politician, you understand what's going on in Israel. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=616.2s)]
*  Are you concerned about the notion that Bibi Netanyahu isn't trying as hard as he can to [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=621.32s)]
*  get this deal because of his own concerns about his own future? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=628.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  I've met with him in Israel. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=635.5600000000001s)]
*  I've met with Ehud Barak in Israel previously as well. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=636.76s)]
*  And obviously they have political differences there. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=640.44s)]
*  But those aside, my sense coming out of this was is he is desperate to end this because [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  this is putting the lives of Israeli citizens at risk every single day. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJkdgDneBho&t=648.5600000000001s)]
