# How Hamas trapped civilians at music festival
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI)
*  Breaking news out of Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=0.0s)]
*  We have new video that we are about to show here out front [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=1.84s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=6.0s)]
*  I do warn you that it is disturbing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  because what it is is shocking new potty cam footage [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=10.24s)]
*  of Hamas shooting indiscriminately at the bathrooms, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  at the porta potties, at the Nova Music Festival, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=18.32s)]
*  indiscriminately shooting at porta potties, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  attempting to kill anybody who may have been inside. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=24.96s)]
*  We have not yet been able to verify [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=27.64s)]
*  if people were actually killed in this moment, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=29.52s)]
*  if you're actually looking at people die behind those doors. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=31.12s)]
*  But obviously that was the plan, that was the intent, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=34.04s)]
*  that's what they were doing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=36.36s)]
*  And CNN is analyzing and verifying more than 50 videos [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=37.56s)]
*  like this one, piecing together exactly how many [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  of the brutal killings, the slaughter, unfolded that morning. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=45.04s)]
*  Katie Poglaz is out front with an in-depth investigation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  It's 6.30 a.m. on October 7th, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=51.88s)]
*  and things are getting into full swing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  at the Nova Festival in the south of Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  We were having fun, peace, love, good vibes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  And an hour, an hour and a half after, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=70.2s)]
*  we are running from bullets. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=72.16s)]
*  Suddenly the music stops. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=74.36s)]
*  There's frustration, but no sense yet [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=76.12s)]
*  of the horror about to unfold. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=78.64s)]
*  As news spreads of rocket attacks from Gaza, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  people begin seeking shelter, crouching close to the ground. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=83.4s)]
*  But even this doesn't lead to outright panic. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=87.44s)]
*  Rocket attacks visible here are a regular occurrence [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=90.36s)]
*  in this part of southern Israel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=93.2s)]
*  About 10 minutes later, and some start heading to their cars. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  The decision of when and how to leave the festival [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=99.4s)]
*  would mean life or death for many. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=103.56s)]
*  Some fled early to nearby bomb shelters at 7.10 a.m. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  and many are crammed inside this one [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  to the north of the festival. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=114.76s)]
*  But they've been followed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  At 7.24 a.m., Hamas throw a grenade inside, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=118.12s)]
*  causing horrific damage. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=123.12s)]
*  This man, Noam, emerges stunned into the daylight. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  And it's not the only shelter to be targeted. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=129.28s)]
*  30 minutes later and further down the same road, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  Hamas militants are caught on dashcam footage [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=134.56s)]
*  outside another shelter. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  They throw a grenade inside. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=139.24s)]
*  In total, CNN has identified four different shelters [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=141.68s)]
*  near the festival that Hamas attacked, all full of people. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=144.88s)]
*  Over the next six hours, hundreds of civilians were killed, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=149.08s)]
*  hunted down as they tried to flee the festival. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=152.4s)]
*  By examining over 50 videos of that morning [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  and speaking to 12 survivors, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=157.88s)]
*  CNN has established that Hamas surrounded the festival, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=159.72s)]
*  blocking three approaches to the south, north and west, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=163.16s)]
*  forcing people to flee across the fields to the east. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=166.92s)]
*  Even then, they were hunted. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=170.72s)]
*  It's now 8.15 a.m. and Gal Bokshpan survives, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=173.12s)]
*  along with others, by running across the fields. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=176.56s)]
*  He's pictured here in the white tee shirt, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=179.56s)]
*  and he's seen the people running around the field. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=181.88s)]
*  He's pictured here in the white tee shirt. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  Local police and security told them to drive east across rough land [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  due to roadblocks on the main road, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=191.2s)]
*  but many end up fleeing on foot. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=193.28s)]
*  We were like ducks. It was like a range. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=195.6s)]
*  People were running in, there were hundreds. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=197.64s)]
*  And you can hear the bullets coming. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  Were you seeing anyone get shot? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=202.56s)]
*  Yeah, you can see people fall. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=204.68s)]
*  It's 8.30 a.m. and as Gal and others continued running east, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=207.56s)]
*  the people running north met with more bullets and a police blockade, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  causing further panic. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=215.48s)]
*  As a result, revelers start running back down the main road [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  towards the festival, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=221.32s)]
*  not knowing there are more militants just a few kilometres further down. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=222.83999999999997s)]
*  On that same road, chilling dashcam footage shows Hamas militants [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=227.83999999999997s)]
*  shooting directly at an approaching car just an hour earlier. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  Those festival-goers that remained closer to the concert site [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=236.88s)]
*  could find anything they could find, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=240.2s)]
*  even behind trees, waiting while the bullets closed in. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=242.4s)]
*  Many did not survive. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=247.2s)]
*  260 are reported dead, but that toll could rise. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=249.07999999999998s)]
*  Just three hours after the start of the massacre at 9.39 a.m., [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  videos emerge of some festival-goers already held hostage in Gaza. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=259.08s)]
*  This man still wearing a festival wristband [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  and another visibly wearing the security uniform. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=266.56s)]
*  Fates remain unknown. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=269.96s)]
*  Gal and others are still processing the trauma of what they went through. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=272.4s)]
*  I know people who were like 12 hours in bushes and they didn't move. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=276.0s)]
*  I know people who tried to hide and they died. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=280.2s)]
*  Humanity never seen this in the last couple of hundreds of years. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=283.52s)]
*  You know, since maybe the Holocaust. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=288.47999999999996s)]
*  But this is just horrific. Horrific. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=292.2s)]
*  It would be 10 hours until help arrived for some. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=296.35999999999996s)]
*  Others are still missing, feared dead or held hostage in Gaza. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=299.88s)]
*  The scale of this tragedy may grow greater yet [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=304.28s)]
*  after those six hours of horror in the desert. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=307.6s)]
*  Katie Poglaze, CNN, London. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=310.4s)]
*  And out front now, Wolf Blitzer. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=315.64s)]
*  Of course, he's been following this story for decades, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=317.48s)]
*  and he knows it better than anyone. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=320.44s)]
*  So, Wolf, when you look at that report [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=322.04s)]
*  and how intricately planned the massacre was at the music festival, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=324.48s)]
*  the slaughter of at least 260 people, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=329.0s)]
*  that footage of someone shooting up the porta-potties, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=331.0s)]
*  going shelter to shelter because they knew where they were, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=334.68s)]
*  waiting till people were in them and then throwing in grenades. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  The more we find out, the harder it is to see a way for this to de-escalate, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=340.12s)]
*  for anyone to back away. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=344.08s)]
*  And I know yesterday you and I spoke, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=346.52s)]
*  you thought there was a very tiny chance [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=348.28s)]
*  that this could calm down and de-escalate. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=350.4s)]
*  Has that chance basically gone to zero now? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=353.56s)]
*  Yes, it's basically zero. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=356.44s)]
*  Based on everything I'm hearing from my Israeli sources, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli military does not mobilize 300,000 [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=362.04s)]
*  or maybe close to 400,000 troops, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=365.72s)]
*  deploys them to this area around Gaza, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=368.04s)]
*  and is not about to try to achieve two major objectives. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=370.96000000000004s)]
*  The first objective, to either capture or kill the Hamas leadership. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=374.6s)]
*  The second objective, to either capture or destroy the Hamas weapons. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=379.36s)]
*  They'd like to capture a lot of those weapons [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  because if they capture the weapons, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=385.72s)]
*  they can determine presumably where they came from. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=387.76000000000005s)]
*  Did they come from Iran, for example? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=390.32000000000005s)]
*  And if they did come from Iran, that creates a moment for the Israelis [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=392.36s)]
*  if they want to continue the escalation [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=397.44000000000005s)]
*  to target some objectives in Iran as well. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=399.84000000000003s)]
*  This could really escalate not just in Gaza, but elsewhere as well. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  And I'm convinced that the Israelis are not going to back away. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  They want to achieve those two objectives. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  It could happen within a matter of hours. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=413.64000000000004s)]
*  It could happen within a matter of a few days. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=415.4s)]
*  But everyone should brace for a major Israeli ground invasion of Gaza. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=417.88s)]
*  And interesting that Colonel Konrikis, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  I know you've been speaking to him too. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=426.56s)]
*  Well, if he said they still don't know the depth of that arsenal [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sScDHHNaHjI&t=427.96s)]
