# What might be giving Israel pause before incursion? Expert lays out possible factors
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q)
*  A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, the top spokesperson, says that it will start [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=0.0s)]
*  firing more airstrikes starting from today and that a ground invasion will begin once [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=4.36s)]
*  the military conditions are optimal. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Joining me now is former State Department negotiator for the Middle East, Aaron David [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=12.32s)]
*  Miller, along with former Department of Homeland Security official Juliette Kayyem. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=16.52s)]
*  And thanks very much to you both. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=20.6s)]
*  Let me just start, Aaron, with you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=22.92s)]
*  We know that Israel has been ready to go for days, that the military has been ready, a [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=25.4s)]
*  state of incredible readiness. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=30.84s)]
*  And when they now are giving 24-hour leaves to soldiers, we've heard they come in, they [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=31.84s)]
*  come out. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=36.76s)]
*  I mean, they are ready. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=37.76s)]
*  And yet, they have not yet gone. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=39.1s)]
*  What do you think is giving the pause? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=42.0s)]
*  First of all, Aaron, thanks for having me. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=44.56s)]
*  A lot of factors, I think. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=48.04s)]
*  Number one, there's weather. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=49.4s)]
*  Number two, there's Israeli indecision about the breadth and depth, exactly how they're [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=51.559999999999995s)]
*  going to do this. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Number three, the president's visit, I think, may have actually engendered a good bit of [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=58.08s)]
*  thinking on the part of the Israelis with respect to the way they're going to do this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=63.04s)]
*  And finally, I think the cruelest dilemma is hostages. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=68.08s)]
*  Israelis are torn between their commitment not necessarily to avenging the deaths of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  1,400 people, but to preempt the possibility this could ever happen again on one hand, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=79.08s)]
*  and their commitment to redeem the living. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've been there now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=87.48s)]
*  You've seen, you've talked to the families. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=89.12s)]
*  Hostage redemption, retrieving Israeli soldiers and civilians dead or alive from the battlefield [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=93.32s)]
*  is a national priority. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=101.32s)]
*  So this is the cruelest dilemma of all, although I think in the end, undermining Hamas and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=102.92s)]
*  destroying its capacity to govern in Gaza would probably be the greater priority. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=110.56s)]
*  And yes, and it appears they've been making that as clear as they can. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=118.32s)]
*  And as I said, the families of the hostages, sometimes with anger, sometimes with acceptance, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=122.28s)]
*  seem to know that. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=128.32s)]
*  There isn't any ambiguity there for them, which only one can imagine that cruel reality [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=130.12s)]
*  for those families who are so desperately hoping. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=134.6s)]
*  Juliet, the thing is, of course, as Israel waits, is ready and waits, there's obviously [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=137.52s)]
*  the military issue of that, which is how long can you be at such a state of readiness with [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=142.96s)]
*  360,000 people on a border and wait? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=146.88s)]
*  How long can you stay down on the start line, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=149.8s)]
*  There's also the question that as they wait, the frustration builds around the world, the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  protests that we've seen obviously have been widespread around the region. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=159.12s)]
*  But one particular one that stood out to me that I keep mentioning because I think the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=162.32s)]
*  scale just really hits me, 80,000 people protesting outside the consulate in Adana, Turkey. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  Adana, Turkey is not a place that most people in the United States have even heard of. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  Eighty thousand people, they had to shut that consulate. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  So what are the risks here? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the risks are multiple. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=179.8s)]
*  I think these are the ones that President Biden has been trying to highlight to the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  Israelis based essentially on our lessons in Afghanistan. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=185.6s)]
*  One is after being attacked, after we were attacked on 9-11, one is what is the end game? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=188.92s)]
*  It is one thing to say, you know, for those of us in counterterrorism, we are going to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=194.28s)]
*  make Hamas not able to govern in Gaza. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=199.32s)]
*  Then what? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=203.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=204.64s)]
*  Is it, are the Israelis actually anticipating being in Gaza? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=205.64s)]
*  And if not, then who is? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=213.6s)]
*  So that's the first question. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=214.6s)]
*  The second is the issue of civilian deaths. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  You know, going back 20 years, we were probably not thinking about what civilian deaths meant [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=220.88s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=227.6s)]
*  Well, it essentially meant that you were radicalizing populations that might not otherwise have [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=228.6s)]
*  been radicalized. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=234.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=235.2s)]
*  So, you know, obviously the human rights issues are key and else. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=236.2s)]
*  The third is if you don't have an answer to the first two questions, how do you stop a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=239.6s)]
*  regional conflict? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=245.0s)]
*  If you, you know, Biden's success so far, I have to say, is what's not happened. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=246.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=251.04s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis have not gone in yet. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=252.04s)]
*  There hasn't been, there's regional anger and there's lots of criticism. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=254.2s)]
*  But you haven't had the kind of unrest that one might have anticipated last Saturday. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=260.4s)]
*  So that's the dialogue that has to go on. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=264.8s)]
*  But what's the end game here for Israel? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=268.08s)]
*  You're not going to govern Gaza. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=271.6s)]
*  I mean, that's their challenge. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=273.67999999999995s)]
*  But Erin, it also comes as there's been this, you know, incredible backlash in the United [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  States. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not just pro-Palestinian rallies, of course. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  It's horrific things like Polis Endevall was just reporting with the head of a synagogue [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=285.55999999999995s)]
*  being stabbed to death outside her home. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there are horrific things happening. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=295.84s)]
*  There is a backlash that is building. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=296.84s)]
*  The reality of it is, is how dangerous is this in the U.S., Erin? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=301.76s)]
*  Well, Erin, that's a question you and I could talk about probably for days, given the divisiveness, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=305.88s)]
*  the polarization, the hate speech, social media, the behavior of certain American politicians, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=313.84s)]
*  which encourage this, I think is extremely dangerous. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=323.4s)]
*  Islamophobia and anti-semitism. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=326.88s)]
*  And that's, those currents clearly are going to be fed by what happened on October 7th [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=329.64s)]
*  and Israel's response in Gaza. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=336.52s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=338.84s)]
*  Our own broken house, frankly, is in some respects as much on display. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=341.24s)]
*  And the president, I think in his remarks the day before yesterday, addressed this question. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=346.32s)]
*  But I think it's absolutely critical that we continue to talk about the importance of [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=351.76s)]
*  tolerance, of mutual understanding. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=358.32s)]
*  And of course, as Juliette knows, Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, follow these [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=360.55999999999995s)]
*  these groups if in fact you're talking about organized responses as closely as possible. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  Right. Right. And the president did, of course, talk about how horrible both things are. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=375.35999999999996s)]
*  Islamophobia, anti-semitism, that they, the U.S. must not succumb to those. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you both so very much. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCugwURWg7Q&t=384.67999999999995s)]
