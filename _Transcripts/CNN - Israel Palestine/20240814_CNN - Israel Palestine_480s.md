# This father went to get birth certificates for newborn twins. Then, he received a tragic phone call

*  A man who hours earlier was locked in the warm embrace of his wife and newborn babies. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=22.44s)]
*  But now cries out in agony, begging to see them one last time. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=29.92s)]
*  His new, horrific reality is too much to bear. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=36.6s)]

*  Hours earlier, their mother Jumana, a pharmacist, was blissfully responding to congratulations [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=63.0s)]
*  and well-wishes on Facebook. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=68.22s)]

*  grief. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=82.68s)]
*  These are the birth certificates, he says. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=83.68s)]
*  While I was getting them, I received a phone call telling me our apartment was targeted [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  and that my wife and children were at Al Aqsa Hospital. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=93.04s)]
*  Neighbors are still sifting through the aftermath of that strike. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=96.48s)]
*  Hospital officials say an Israeli shell hit the building. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=100.76s)]
*  The Israeli military did not respond to CNN's request for comment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=103.4s)]
*  The victims of several other strikes in central Gaza also pour into Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=108.84s)]

*  How can I live after you, my son? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  This mother cries. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=121.68s)]
*  Amid the grief, there is also anger and exasperation, including from the dead man's father. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=123.76s)]
*  The entire unjust world does not care about this. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=131.04s)]
*  That's all I can say, Hassan says. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=133.8s)]
*  We are just numbers, but for God, we are martyrs. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=136.84s)]
*  One by one, their bodies are brought out of the morgue so the living can pray for the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=141.2s)]
*  dead, including 9-month-old Jamal and his father, Uday. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=145.32s)]
*  Mohammed is performing the same rituals for his wife and twin babies. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=151.6s)]
*  But prayers offer little comfort for a man who has lost everything, for a new father [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=156.44s)]
*  with no children to raise. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=161.72s)]
*  Jeremy Dimon, CNN, Haifa, Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=164.24s)]
*  Israel-Hamas ceasefire talks are set to resume Thursday in Doha, and a lot is writing on them. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=168.08s)]
*  There has been some speculation that Iran might hold off on plans to attack Israel if [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=174.52s)]
*  a Gaza ceasefire is reached soon. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=180.4s)]
*  But some have cast serious doubt on that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  Iran has vowed to retaliate for the assassination of Hamas's political leader in Tehran, an [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=185.68s)]
*  attack that it blames on Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=191.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, sources tell CNN Hamas is taking a position of intentional ambiguity about [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=193.76000000000002s)]
*  appearing at the Doha talks. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  Representatives from Israel, Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. are all taking part. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=202.96s)]
*  Nick Robertson joining us now from Tel Aviv with the details. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  Hi there, Nick. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=211.0s)]
*  So Hamas being very noncommittal about the talks that are set for Thursday, what are [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=212.36s)]
*  you watching for? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=218.36s)]
*  And if they don't show, are the talks off? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=219.36s)]
*  No, there's a part of the talks that's going to happen there, proximity talks. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=224.68s)]
*  So the U.S. and Israel and the intermediaries, Qatar and Egypt, can meet and are expected [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=229.36s)]
*  to meet in Doha tomorrow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=235.16s)]
*  We do sort of see this strategic or this ambiguity by Hamas as a potential way to try to put [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=238.6s)]
*  pressure on the Israeli government because they're being very specific about why they [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=248.0s)]
*  have this ambiguity. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  They are saying these are not negotiations from their point of view, that the meeting [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  in Doha should be about implementing the framework that President Biden put forward in over the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=260.28s)]
*  past couple of months, that they say that the Israeli government, Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=269.2s)]
*  has added on additional things like control and veto over prisoner releases about the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=274.48s)]
*  control of the Philadelphia Corridor, the control of the Ra'affa border crossing, all [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=282.92s)]
*  of which are huge issues for Hamas that they say were not part of that original framework. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=287.6s)]
*  So from their perspective, you know, speaking to other sources who are informed about the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=293.68s)]
*  talks and about Hamas' position, it seems clear through this ambiguity as well, very [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=301.64s)]
*  clear that if the talks were to go in Doha between the U.S. and Israel and Qataris and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=308.08s)]
*  the Egyptians as Hamas wants, then they would have somebody available to have a follow-on [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=315.44s)]
*  discussion with. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=322.0s)]
*  But I don't think expectations are at that point. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=324.28s)]
*  I think the expectations really at the moment are questioning what is going to be different [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=327.24s)]
*  about these talks than any other, how much or has there been any substantial change on [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=332.68s)]
*  the negotiating position of either side, either Hamas or Israel? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=337.2s)]
*  And that's where things stand. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=340.44s)]
*  And of course, that's what Iran is waiting to see. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=341.44s)]
*  And the expectation is, regardless of the outcome of these talks, Iran will strike. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=344.91999999999996s)]
*  It's just a question of how big that strike would be. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=349.32s)]
*  And Nick, if you want to talk to us about what you're hearing there in Israel, because [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=352.84s)]
*  obviously Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been facing a lot of pressure. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  And there seems to be a difference between what the public wants versus the political [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=362.08s)]
*  will and what the government is aiming for. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the latest polling on some of the channels here in Israel indicates about two-thirds [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=369.84s)]
*  of the population would go for a hostage deal as it's been outlined already, which [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=378.12s)]
*  is a significant number. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=384.52s)]
*  But that's not the position of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that we know. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=386.64s)]
*  And it's certainly not the position that the hard-right members of his coalition government [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=390.0s)]
*  are willing to tolerate. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=396.24s)]
*  They threaten to get out of the talks if he went for that kind of deal. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=398.08s)]
*  I think there's been a lot of expectation in the region, particularly in trying to get [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=401.92s)]
*  these talks up and running tomorrow, that there would be a lot of U.S. pressure on Prime [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=406.76000000000005s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu to change his position, not to have these add-ons that Hamas talks [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=411.56s)]
*  about, although his office says they don't, they haven't put any add-ons to President [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=417.12s)]
*  Biden's framework. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=420.6s)]
*  And when we had the announcement yesterday that the United States was going to clear [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=422.6s)]
*  $20 billion worth of military equipment to Israel, this is part of a long process, and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=430.0s)]
*  it's only part of that process, and it's only provisional. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=439.52s)]
*  The timing of it, because it's been a long process, did seem to indicate that the United [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=443.12s)]
*  States potentially, potentially trying to give Prime Minister Netanyahu something in [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=447.68s)]
*  return for what they may hope comes out of these talks. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=455.2s)]
*  I would say no one is holding their breath that that would be the outcome from this. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=457.88s)]
*  Yeah, they understand the complexities and reality of all that is taken into account. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  Nick Robertson, appreciate your reporting there from Tel Aviv. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=467.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AYZE3PgNQQ&t=469.2s)]
