Video Description: The US intelligence community produced at least two assessments based in part on intelligence provided by Israel warning the Biden administration of an increased risk for Palestinian-Israeli conflict in the weeks ahead of the seismic attack on southern Israel, according to sources familiar with the intelligence. It is unclear if the US assessments were shared with Israel, which provides much of the intelligence that the US bases its reports on. #CNN #News

# US intelligence warned of potential for Gaza clash in days before attack
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg)
*  I want to bring in CNN's Katie Bo Lillis. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=0.0s)]
*  She's got new reporting that US [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=2.16s)]
*  intelligence did have some warnings [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=3.96s)]
*  about a prospect of more violence [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=5.64s)]
*  here from Hamas just days before [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Saturday's surprise attack. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=9.6s)]
*  Katie Bo, what did these reports [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=10.64s)]
*  say? How specific were there? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=12.56s)]
*  Yeah, so Anderson, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=14.24s)]
*  what we have learned is that the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=15.24s)]
*  intelligence community was circulating [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=17.56s)]
*  a pair of two separate intelligence [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=18.96s)]
*  assessments just in the days leading [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=21.04s)]
*  into October 7th devastating attack. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=23.0s)]
*  One of them on September 28th [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=24.8s)]
*  warrant based on multiple streams [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=26.84s)]
*  of intelligence that Hamas was [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=28.76s)]
*  poised to escalate with some cross [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=30.76s)]
*  border rocket fire into Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=32.96s)]
*  A separate October 5th wire from the CIA [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=34.84s)]
*  warned sort of generally of the of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=37.56s)]
*  the increasing possibility by the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=40.04s)]
*  increasing possibility of violence by [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Hamas, but Anderson, I think what's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  really important to understand here [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=45.44s)]
*  is that none of these two. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  None of neither of these two reports [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=48.92s)]
*  provided any sort of specific tactical [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=51.160000000000004s)]
*  detail about the size, scope, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=53.24s)]
*  scale, brutality of the attack that [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=54.84s)]
*  actually did occur on October 7th. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=56.92s)]
*  So they were these sort of kind [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=59.120000000000005s)]
*  of high level warnings that you know. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=61.24s)]
*  Look, the tensions in between sort [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=63.6s)]
*  of Palestinian militant groups [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=65.52s)]
*  and and Israel are growing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=67.08s)]
*  There's an increased possibility [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  for violence, but they weren't [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=70.2s)]
*  offering any sort of specific [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=71.88s)]
*  evidence of the planning for the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=73.44s)]
*  attack that actually unfolded on Saturday. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=75.4s)]
*  Do we know if those reports were [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=79.16s)]
*  passed on to Israeli intelligence or [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=81.08s)]
*  or it sounds like it didn't really [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=82.92s)]
*  have any particular alarm bells? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=85.12s)]
*  Because it kind of sounded like, well, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=86.92s)]
*  there may be more rocket attacks, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  but not nothing really too specific. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so this is the important thing [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=92.28s)]
*  to understand the nuance here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=94.2s)]
*  To understand here, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=95.64s)]
*  Anderson is there's a big difference [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  in between sort of strategic warning [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=98.0s)]
*  and kind of more kind of tactical [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=99.56s)]
*  warning about OK, here's exactly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=101.44s)]
*  what's about to happen. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=102.84s)]
*  And so this was certainly kind of in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=103.92s)]
*  the in the camp of strategic warning, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=105.72s)]
*  right? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  And I think based on what our sources [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=107.88000000000001s)]
*  are telling us for a lot of officials [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  who were reading this intelligence, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=111.76s)]
*  you know they were interpreting it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=113.28s)]
*  as there's some kind of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=114.92s)]
*  tension tensions in the region. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=115.92s)]
*  There's something to be concerned about. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  Something could happen here, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=118.92s)]
*  but they they were sort of viewing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=120.0s)]
*  this as likely another round of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=121.64s)]
*  cross border rocket fire. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=123.36s)]
*  You know, maybe the Iron Dome [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=124.52s)]
*  intercepts some missiles. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Maybe Israel retaliates. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=126.72s)]
*  You know, maybe we even see something [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=127.52s)]
*  as dramatic as the clash that took [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=129.28s)]
*  place in 2021 in between Hamas and Israel, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=131.08s)]
*  but they weren't in any way sort of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=133.24s)]
*  imagining that these warnings were [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=135.24s)]
*  indicating something of the size and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=136.88s)]
*  scale of what we did see on Saturday. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=138.68s)]
*  As for whether or not this was [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=140.72s)]
*  shared with Israeli officials, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=142.72s)]
*  but because the United States doesn't [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  do a lot of its own intelligence [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=146.24s)]
*  collection inside Gaza, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=148.28s)]
*  it really relies on Israel to do a lot [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  of that sort of raw reporting and a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=151.68s)]
*  lot of that collection. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=153.84s)]
*  It just sort of takes the information [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=155.04s)]
*  and then analyzes it for itself. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=157.0s)]
*  Many of the officials that we spoke to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=158.72s)]
*  said it wouldn't necessarily be indicated [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=160.8s)]
*  for the US to sort of turn around and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=162.8s)]
*  share these reports or share these [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=165.24s)]
*  sort of assessments with Israel again, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=167.16s)]
*  because much of the raw information in [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=168.92s)]
*  these intelligence assessments was [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=171.0s)]
*  coming from Israel in the first place, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  and Israel wasn't raising these alarm [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=174.52s)]
*  bells with the United States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=176.68s)]
*  Katie Bolillo's appreciate the recording. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=179.8s)]

*  First of all, what do you make of this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=196.44000000000003s)]
*  this new information about US [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  intelligence warning that something [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=198.8s)]
*  may be happening, some uptick, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=202.44000000000003s)]
*  not too specific? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=204.08s)]
*  What do you should it have been caught? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=205.8s)]
*  Should that have raised more alarms? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=210.52s)]
*  I'm not surprised that we had some [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=211.88000000000002s)]
*  type of intelligence at that level. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=213.52s)]
*  I am a little surprised that there [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  weren't there wasn't more preparation [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  taking taken on the Israeli end, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=220.24s)]
*  if you will, to, you know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=222.08s)]
*  heightened the security level [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  along the fence line, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=225.8s)]
*  the borderline between Israel and Gaza. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=226.8s)]
*  I think there have been two failures. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  If you look at the situation now, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=232.16s)]
*  one has been the intelligence failure. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=233.52s)]
*  But the second one is the military [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=235.16s)]
*  readiness failure to to step up patrol [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=237.0s)]
*  surveillance or whatnot along the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=240.84s)]
*  along the border. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=243.28s)]
*  So that look, that there'll be time [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=244.12s)]
*  for that later. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  But that's kind of what jumps to my mind [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=246.6s)]
*  when we talk about this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=248.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=251.56s)]
*  And as you said, I mean, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=251.84s)]
*  time for that later. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=252.64s)]
*  But but Sina did do a report [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=253.44s)]
*  just our clerical board was looking at [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=255.24s)]
*  what the Hamas, the training videos [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=258.28s)]
*  they were putting out. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=260.92s)]
*  And we've geolocated a site that they built, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=262.40000000000003s)]
*  which mirrored a Israeli settler [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  community that they were doing training [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=268.72s)]
*  on that was very close to one of the major [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=271.44s)]
*  boarding crossings and was visible from the air. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=273.6s)]
*  It's remarkable that that Israel did not [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  pick up any real signs of this operation, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  which was clearly planned [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  for a very long period of time, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  involving many, many different people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=287.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that was a very interesting report. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  And I read it with some good deal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  of curiosity that it would go back that far [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=293.68s)]
*  and it was should have been visible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=295.92s)]
*  Like I said, I think there will be time later. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  They'll go back and really dig into this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  I think the immediate question now, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=302.16s)]
*  when you look at these pieces of information [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=303.48s)]
*  that should have been assessed, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  is clearly there was a blind spot. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  Blind spot. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  And as you go into this next phase [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  where you're looking at a military [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=313.08000000000004s)]
*  incursion into Gaza and maybe some other things, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  I do think you want to make sure [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=317.36s)]
*  I do think you want to make a quick check [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=318.48s)]
*  to make sure that those blind spots are no longer there. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=319.68s)]
*  And so I think there is a need for an immediate [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  assessment as to what happened and why. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=324.16s)]
*  And then you can dig later, kind of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  pull each and every thread later. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=327.92s)]
*  But that would be my concern is what [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=329.88s)]
*  what didn't we see over the past year [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  and why didn't we see it? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=333.92s)]
*  And have we rectified that before we step [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=335.04s)]
*  into these next phases of the operation? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=337.92s)]
*  I want to ask you what do you think about [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=341.44s)]
*  the idea of a million residents in Gaza [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=343.32s)]
*  moving south in a 24 hour period, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=346.88s)]
*  which is what Israel is is telling people to do. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=349.68s)]
*  They drop leaflets, do it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=353.44s)]
*  You have a number of humanitarian organizations [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=354.64s)]
*  saying this is impossible. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=357.12s)]
*  It's it's going to lead to catastrophic consequences. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=358.8s)]
*  Hamas is saying don't leave. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=361.64s)]
*  I understand militarily why they would not [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=363.44s)]
*  want the civilian population to leave. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=365.44s)]
*  They want to use them as much as possible as human shields. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=367.08s)]
*  Have you seen mass migrations of people like that? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=372.24s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=374.68s)]
*  Look, moving a million people in 24 hours [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=377.88s)]
*  is a difficult task, but I've also never seen [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=380.96s)]
*  a military on the cusp of an invasion [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=383.68s)]
*  give a warning to the adversaries that they're coming in [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=385.88s)]
*  and to and to allow citizens some time, if you will, to flee. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=389.68s)]
*  Look, it's a tough situation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=395.08s)]
*  There was a situation brought on by these atrocious, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=396.96s)]
*  terrible, barbaric terrorist acts by Hamas, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  killing over 1300 Israelis, murdering, raping, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=403.08000000000004s)]
*  slaughtering children, the elderly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  And now on top of that, we know that we have [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  130 to 150 hostages in Gaza. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  I'd like to see these UN agencies come out [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  and demand that Hamas release the hostages. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=416.8s)]
*  That would be a great gesture as well. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  But look, it's a tough situation. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=421.36s)]
*  Israel has every right to proceed, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  and I think they'll do so professionally. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=427.56s)]
*  And I think they've given fair warning. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=429.8s)]
*  And then I think, look, I'm in favor of opening up [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=432.12s)]
*  a humanitarian corridor in the South, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=435.08s)]
*  but I would limit that to women, children, and the elderly [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=437.24s)]
*  and trying to address that side of the problem that way. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=440.64s)]
*  In terms of the fight ahead, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  how difficult do you think it's gonna be? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=447.56s)]
*  Obviously there's the civilian component, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=450.12s)]
*  there's the hostages to think about, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=451.96s)]
*  and just operating in an urban environment like Gaza City, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=454.71999999999997s)]
*  it is a warren of streets and it is densely packed. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=459.32s)]
*  How difficult from your perspective is it? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=466.44s)]
*  Very difficult. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=469.44s)]
*  First of all, at the strategic level, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=470.52s)]
*  every day or moment that passes, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=472.2s)]
*  you have to make sure that you don't create [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=474.4s)]
*  a second front with Hezbollah in the North. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=476.24s)]
*  You don't wanna fight two fronts at the same time. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=478.24s)]
*  Of course, on top of that, as we already addressed, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  you have hostages. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  And so, will Hamas follow through on their threats [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=483.88s)]
*  to begin executing hostages, Israelis, and Americans, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=486.2s)]
*  by the way, we think they have a few Americans [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=490.0s)]
*  as this proceeds. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=492.03999999999996s)]
*  At the tactical level, urban warfare is very, very difficult. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=494.08s)]
*  I know from my time in the army, during the Gulf War, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=497.36s)]
*  as we faced urban areas, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=500.08s)]
*  it can consume a lot of troops very quickly. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=501.96s)]
*  So I think part of what Israel is doing right now [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=504.64s)]
*  by flattening buildings and pummeling the area [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=507.2s)]
*  is really trying to reduce the amount of places and spaces [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=510.52s)]
*  and floors and doors in every place that Hamas can hide [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=514.68s)]
*  to ambush Israeli troops as they come through [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=518.0s)]
*  and try and clear out the areas. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=520.4799999999999s)]
*  They try to uncover the subterranean networks [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=521.92s)]
*  that Hamas has built underneath Gaza. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=525.0s)]
*  But it's really difficult. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=527.2399999999999s)]
*  It can consume a lot of troops, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=528.9599999999999s)]
*  even if they're not killed or injured. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=530.3199999999999s)]
*  You just have to leave troops behind to protect the space. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=531.8s)]
*  Part of my concern here is that maybe the lack of action [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=534.5999999999999s)]
*  by Hezbollah in the North isn't because [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=537.68s)]
*  they've made a strategic decision to sit the conflict out, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=539.92s)]
*  but maybe they made an operational decision [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=543.6400000000001s)]
*  to execute some, yeah, execute some patients [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=545.6400000000001s)]
*  and wait till the IDF gets really entrenched in Gaza, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=549.84s)]
*  gets bogged down, and then they start something in the North. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=553.5600000000001s)]
*  And that would be an operational matter, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  which I'm sure the IDF is considering [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=560.0s)]
*  very carefully as well. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=561.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=564.48s)]
*  thank you for your time. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViGf_NojEWg&t=566.36s)]
