# Israel launches new round of attacks into southern Lebanon
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg)
*  Biden delivered his final address to the United Nations General Assembly today, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=0.0s)]
*  calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and urging de-escalation in the fighting [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=3.84s)]
*  between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=8.52s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=10.44s)]
*  Full-scale war is not in anyone's interest. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=11.96s)]
*  Even if a situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=14.96s)]
*  In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=20.44s)]
*  The president's speech comes as the conflict in southern Lebanon boiling over [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  with Israel launching a fresh round of attacks today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=29.8s)]
*  CNN's Ben Wiedemann has the latest. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=32.44s)]
*  Chaos and dust moments after an Israeli airstrike on South Beirut. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=37.24s)]
*  Israel claimed the target was an important Hezbollah operative. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=41.96s)]
*  Hezbollah said nothing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=45.64s)]
*  At least six were killed, 15 injured. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=47.72s)]
*  Hezbollah continues to fire unabated rockets over the border. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=52.2s)]
*  After Monday's punishing Israeli bombing, Lebanon suffered its highest daily death toll [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  since the 1982 Sabra Shatila massacre, a fourth of the dead, women and children. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  South of Beirut, the funerals have begun, the coffins draped with Hezbollah's banner. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=73.0s)]
*  What was a border war is looking like a full-on war. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=79.8s)]
*  And like the last war, tens of thousands again are fleeing for their lives. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=84.76s)]
*  No easy task for the elderly and infirm. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=90.92s)]
*  To dozens of schools in the capital turned into shelters for the displaced, shades of Gaza. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=94.48s)]
*  Most left everything behind, some including their dead. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=101.0s)]
*  It's true we left, but material things can be replaced, says Zeynep. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=106.36s)]
*  Lives cannot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=110.76s)]
*  Losing someone is incredibly hard. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=112.08s)]
*  Home for Abu Ali and his family of six, now a bare classroom. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=114.72s)]
*  I ask him if, as Israel says, it was only striking Hezbollah targets. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=119.16s)]
*  Liars, they're liars, he shoots back. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=126.56s)]
*  Entire families are gone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=129.2s)]
*  They're not Hezbollah targets. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=131.2s)]
*  We live in the south. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=132.88s)]
*  We don't know where Hezbollah is. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=133.88s)]
*  And I don't know where the Hezbollah fighters are. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=135.76s)]
*  Dr. Jihad Saadi treated the injured in the 2006 war, and here at this hospital in Beirut, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=138.56s)]
*  he's doing it all over again. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=145.32000000000002s)]
*  All of them are civilians. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  They are families where their houses, they were buried in their houses, yes, in the south. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Three of them had head traumas, and the rest had different traumas of the body, like we [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  see in every war. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  It's happening again. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=169.16s)]
*  All too familiar. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=171.16s)]
*  And Wolf, in the beginning of the report, I mentioned that strike on Beirut and Israeli, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=176.84s)]
*  Israel's claims that a senior Hezbollah operative was hit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=182.4s)]
*  Now Hezbollah, just minutes ago, has come out with an announcement that indeed a senior [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  operative was hit. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=193.08s)]
*  That was Commander Ibrahim Qubaisi, who apparently was responsible for Hezbollah's network of [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  missiles and rockets. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=202.32s)]
*  And in addition to that, we're hearing from the British Defense Ministry that Britain [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=205.32s)]
*  is deploying 700 troops to Cyprus in preparation for contingency plans, probably evacuations. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=209.28s)]
*  Wolf? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=217.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think the U.S. is sending additional troops to the region as well to help with [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=218.72s)]
*  that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=223.12s)]
*  Thank you very much for that report. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  I want to continue this discussion right now with U.S. AID aid administrator Samantha Power. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=225.72s)]
*  Administrator, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=231.4s)]
*  A series of strikes are part of this reported Israeli strategy of what they're calling [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=233.8s)]
*  escalate to de-escalate. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=239.68s)]
*  But how dangerous potentially could this be for civilians on both sides in southern Lebanon [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  and in northern Israel? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=247.36s)]
*  Well, we've already seen over these last weeks, 70,000 Israeli civilians displaced, more than [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=249.72s)]
*  110,000 Lebanese. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=256.12s)]
*  We see the human toll in some of the images that have come out today and over the last [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=258.96s)]
*  few days in Lebanon. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=264.32s)]
*  Our focus as U.S. aid, of course, is how do we ramp up the humanitarian response if people [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=266.88s)]
*  are in fact displaced from their homes, if they're taking flight. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=272.47999999999996s)]
*  President Biden's message today was crystal clear, which is de-escalation is the only [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=276.92s)]
*  path that can actually blunt these consequences that keep occurring. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=282.22s)]
*  I mean, we see the conflict in Gaza, the conflict in Sudan, what this human toll is. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=287.54s)]
*  And this is why U.S. Diplomacy has been so focused on taking down the temperature. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=293.74s)]
*  But of course, recent events make that very challenging. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=299.22s)]
*  And I just want to clarify, is the U.S. moving additional troops and equipment to the region [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=302.58s)]
*  in order to help evacuate American citizens from both Lebanon and Israel? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=307.66s)]
*  I am not involved in the evacuation plans, again, just focused on the humanitarian response. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=313.54s)]
*  So I would refer you to our defense colleagues in the White House to get the latest on that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=318.26s)]
*  But of course, we all have to be thinking in terms of contingency planning. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=322.82s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=325.78s)]
*  We'll watch that and see what happens. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=326.78s)]
*  The news publication is reporting that in April, your organization, USAID, wrote a memo [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=329.17999999999995s)]
*  that Israel deliberately blocked food and medicine from Gaza and that the U.S. should [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=334.61999999999995s)]
*  therefore pause arms sales to Israel. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  Was that your determination? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=342.97999999999996s)]
*  And is the administration listening and abiding by U.S. law? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, Wolf, as you know, over many, many months, indeed almost a year now since October 7th, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=348.85999999999996s)]
*  we have been pushing to get the hostages released in the first instance, but also to get as [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=354.82s)]
*  much humanitarian assistance as possible to the people of Gaza. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=359.5s)]
*  The circumstances, particularly heading into winter now, are absolutely desperate. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=362.9s)]
*  We remember last winter how bad it was for Palestinian civilians in Gaza. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=367.38s)]
*  Flash forward when such a high percentage of the buildings and the structures and the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=371.34s)]
*  agricultural land has all been destroyed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=376.7s)]
*  And that's the situation we're in today. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=379.26s)]
*  And you see these flimsy tarps on the beach. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=381.5s)]
*  And imagine when those temperatures go down and the seas come up. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=383.42s)]
*  It's just really human misery. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=386.38s)]
*  So that has been our posture. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=388.54s)]
*  We've been pushing the Israelis. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=389.62s)]
*  We've been, of course, deliberating internally about how best to bring about the most forward-leaning [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=391.58000000000004s)]
*  posture so as much assistance comes in as possible. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=396.82000000000005s)]
*  I'm not going to comment on any report from a long time ago, but we've been very, very [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=399.62s)]
*  clear. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=405.22s)]
*  And the president, of course, has really focused on these humanitarian issues in all of his [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=406.22s)]
*  engagements with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=410.22s)]
*  On another very sensitive humanitarian issue that's unfolding right now, we're talking [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  about Sudan. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=416.1s)]
*  President Biden today said and has addressed before the UN General Assembly that the war [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=417.66s)]
*  must end there, but he just named the UAE a major defense partner despite UAE support [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=421.66s)]
*  for the paramilitary group in Sudan. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=428.1s)]
*  Does that undermine U.S. efforts? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=431.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, I myself have had engagement with UAE senior officials in these last days. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=433.86s)]
*  President Biden, of course, that announcement comes out of a bilateral meeting that occurred [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=440.1s)]
*  this week with the president of the UAE. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=445.1s)]
*  A major topic of the engagement is Sudan, a major topic with all countries that are [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=447.62s)]
*  putting weapons into that conflict or have been providing political support. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=454.86s)]
*  That has been a topic of all of our engagements in the UN General Assembly. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=460.56s)]
*  High-level week, of course, is really useful because so many stakeholders are here. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=463.98s)]
*  Those two parties, the Sudanese Armed Forces, the Rapid Support Forces, they are not putting [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=468.66s)]
*  their country first. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=473.06s)]
*  They are putting their own self-interest first. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=474.06s)]
*  And no member state of the United Nations should be supporting them in their efforts, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=476.5s)]
*  which are resulting in large-scale civilian casualties and indeed mass atrocities in many [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=480.62s)]
*  cases. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=486.1s)]
*  It's a horrible situation there. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=487.1s)]
*  Samantha Power, Administrator, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCZ12evbTwg&t=488.1s)]
