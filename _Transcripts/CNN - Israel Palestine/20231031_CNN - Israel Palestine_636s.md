*  Not in the face of intensifying strategic competition in the Indo-Pacific and around the world not in the face of terrorism and its state sponsors [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  And America does not stand alone [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=158.72s)]
*  We built extraordinary coalitions with friends who carry their share of the burden which I'm happy to come back to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=161.35999999999999s)]
*  our adversaries and competitors alike [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  Recognize that our strategies are working and they continue to do everything they can to disrupt us [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=169.56s)]
*  We now stand at a moment where many are again making the bet that we're too divided [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=174.64s)]
*  We're too distracted at home to stay the course. That's what's at stake with President Biden's national security supplemental funding request [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=180.04s)]
*  President's request would secure the urgent resources that we need to continue to lead [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=188.04s)]
*  Secretary Austin and I believe it important for us to be here together today because in this mission as [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=193.48s)]
*  In so much that we do to advance America's national security our defense our diplomacy our development must work hand-in-hand [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=198.92s)]
*  Committee will suspend and again, I I appreciate that people feel passionately about these issues [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  I would ask that you respect our witnesses and our committee members and allow the American people to hear their testimony [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=216.68s)]
*  We will pause until the room is cleared [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=222.68s)]
*  5500 kids dead come on. I'm an army colonel. I'm a former diplomat [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  I resigned on that war in Iraq that you talked about that was a terrible thing and what we're doing right now [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=234.68s)]
*  supporting Israel's genocide [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=241.24s)]
*  Thank you, sir, third blanket if you can continue please thank you chair [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=246.76s)]
*  The president's funding request has four key elements [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=251.0s)]
*  First it provides for our enduring support to Israel and Ukraine [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=254.11999999999998s)]
*  To democracies under brutal assault by actors determined to wipe their nations off the map [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  It will ensure that Israel can continue to defend its people by building on the diplomatic security and intelligence support [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  That the United States has surged since Hamas is appalling slaughter. I know that several [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=270.56s)]
*  Committee will suspend and I again ask that those in the audience respect the people in the room and allow us to continue the hearing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=276.64s)]
*  The hearing will suspend until the disruption is removed [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=283.64s)]
*  Thank You secretary Blinken if you can continue please so I was saying I know that several committee members have traveled Israel over the last three weeks [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=307.64s)]
*  they've heard directly from Israeli officials what they need to defend their people and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=314.8s)]
*  prevent another attack like this one and that's exactly what the supplemental provides with 3.7 billion for security needs [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=319.96s)]
*  Including to help Israel bolster its air and missile defense systems [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=327.68s)]
*  Supplemental also requests additional authority to draw down DoD stocks and enhances the security of our embassy [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=331.28s)]
*  As president Biden has made clear from the outset while Israel has the right indeed [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=337.96s)]
*  It has the obligation to defend itself the way it does so matters [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=342.4s)]
*  In our discussions with the Israeli government the president and I have both stressed the need for Israel to operate by the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=347.0s)]
*  Committee will suspend [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=356.88s)]
*  Oh [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=360.44s)]
*  Secretary Blinken you may continue thank you chair [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=369.48s)]
*  So I was saying the president I both stressed in our conversations with the Israeli government the need for Israel to operate by the law of war [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=372.36s)]
*  And in accordance with international humanitarian law and to take all possible measures to avoid civilian casualties [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=379.12s)]
*  For Ukraine president Biden is requesting 16.3 billion to supply Ukraine's defense without which [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  Russia will move quickly to try to seize and exploit any possible opening and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  To ensure that Ukraine can sustain the economic base and recovery that its war effort depends on [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=397.48s)]
*  This funding will not only rebuild Ukraine's economy and offset the damage brought by Russia [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=403.04s)]
*  But it will also help to reimagine it investing in new industries [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=407.24s)]
*  infrastructure and supply chains connected to Europe and to the world [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=411.40000000000003s)]

*  To be strong enough to deter and defend against aggressors beyond its borders [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  Ukraine needs a resilient economy and a vibrant democracy within its borders [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=423.88000000000005s)]
*  Since Russia lost its war the robust funding supported by Congress has enabled the people of Ukraine in their courageous fight to defend their nation [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=429.36s)]
*  It's helped make sure that Russia's invasion and strategic [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=437.52000000000004s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=599.26s)]
*  So to continue, since Russia launched this war, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=601.26s)]
*  the robust funding provided by [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=603.26s)]
*  Congress has enabled the people of Ukraine [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=605.26s)]
*  in their courageous fight to defend their nation. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=607.26s)]
*  It's helped make sure that Russia's invasion [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=609.26s)]

*  making it weaker in nearly every way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=613.26s)]
*  And it's rallied the world [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=615.26s)]
*  in defense of Ukraine and of the [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=617.26s)]

*  Turning our backs on their [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=629.26s)]
*  efforts would have lasting implications [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=631.26s)]
*  for our own security and our own standing in the world. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-Ag7iMJnM&t=633.26s)]
