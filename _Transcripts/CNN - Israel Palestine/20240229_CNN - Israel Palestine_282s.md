# Bernie Sanders: US should not give Netanyahu 'another nickel'
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps)
*  President Biden is weighing in on this, talking about what that violent scene [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=0.0s)]
*  could mean for those ongoing painstaking negotiations that have been [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=3.4s)]
*  underway for a ceasefire, a ceasefire that I should note earlier this week, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=7.32s)]
*  President Biden predicted could happen as soon as Monday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=11.620000000000001s)]
*  You know, in the city, more than 100 civilians were killed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=16.96s)]
*  I was just checking it out right now. But there's a security burden with that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=21.16s)]
*  I don't have an answer yet. Are you worried that that will cost patience? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=25.8s)]
*  I know. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=28.84s)]
*  He's not saying that he is predicting it could. He says he knows that it will [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  affect these negotiations that have been underway, come close and falling [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=36.64s)]
*  apart. Just this week, the president witnessed the impact that his handling [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=40.44s)]
*  of this war could have on his political chances come November. I sat down [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=44.24s)]
*  exclusively with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to talk about that reality and [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=48.44s)]
*  what he thinks should happen next. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=52.96s)]
*  Senator, thank you for being here. It's great to sit down with you. We saw the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=55.84s)]
*  Democratic primary layout in Michigan and over 100,000 voters voted uncommitted [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=60.92s)]
*  in a protest of how President Biden has handled the war that Israel's waging in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=66.88s)]
*  Gaza. Is that a warning sign to the White House in your view? I think it is. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=71.16s)]
*  I mean, I think all over this country, people looking at what's going on in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=75.52s)]
*  Gaza and really cannot believe what they're seeing. I mean, it's not only [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=80.2s)]
*  that 30,000 Palestinians have been killed and 70,000 wounded. Two-thirds of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=83.6s)]
*  them are women and children. But, Caitlin, what we are looking at at this moment is [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=88.28s)]
*  the starvation of hundreds of thousands of children. And that is because of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  Israeli bombardments and that is because of the restrictions at the border [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=98.24s)]
*  preventing humanitarian aid from getting in. This is absolutely unacceptable. And [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=101.84s)]
*  in my view, as I've said this a million times, the United States should not be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  giving Netanyahu and his extreme right-wing government another nickel for [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=111.28s)]
*  their war epics that are killing so many innocent Palestinians. When the White [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=116.16s)]
*  House says, you know, we're listening to these voters who have that same exact [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=121.16s)]
*  concern that you do about the aid that is going to Israel with no restrictions [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=125.48s)]
*  on it, the president has sent campaign aides to talk to Arab Americans. He sent [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=129.24s)]
*  White House officials, including national security aides. But should he [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=134.28s)]
*  himself be having these conversations directly? It's not a sense, it's not whether it's [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=137.58s)]
*  him or his aides. It's what the policy is. That's what's important. And what the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=141.04s)]
*  president has got to do, in my view, is tell Netanyahu, sorry, you're not getting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  another nickel of U.S. taxpayer money to murder women and children in Gaza. That [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=150.76s)]
*  has to be a major change in the Israeli policies. It has a lot to do with the two [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=156.76s)]
*  state solution and where we go at the end of this war. If he doesn't do that, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=163.39999999999998s)]
*  do you think those 100,000 voters won't come home in November? Well, I don't want [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=169.0s)]
*  to. Nobody can speculate it. Nobody knows. You haven't talked to 100,000 of them [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=173.36s)]
*  lately, have you? Nobody has. But I do think this. The contrast between Biden [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=176.88s)]
*  and Trump is pretty clear. I think most of those people who voted for uncommitted [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=182.84s)]
*  understand that. Biden has done, by and large, a good job for working people. He [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=186.84s)]
*  understands that climate change is real. And on the other hand, you have Donald [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=192.16s)]
*  Trump, who is a pathological liar, who wants to deny every woman in America the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=197.32s)]
*  right to control her own body, who doesn't even understand that climate [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=201.35999999999999s)]
*  change is real. So I think the choice is clear. But I think there are a lot of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  people who are upset about the president's policies regarding the war [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=208.2s)]
*  in Israel. You've been really outspoken in calling for a ceasefire, and you're a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=214.2s)]
*  champion of policies on the left. I mean, everyone witnessed your runs for [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=218.32s)]
*  president. You, though, have also faced some of what President Biden has when [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=223.08s)]
*  he's out speaking publicly, which is people calling for ceasefires or calling [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=227.44000000000003s)]
*  for you to call it a genocide, something that you cannot. Yeah, I know. That's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=231.24s)]
*  true. But I don't know that we want to be arguing whether it's a mass slaughter [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=235.36s)]
*  or genocide. It's kind of a technical term that the International Court of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=239.44s)]
*  Justice is looking at. Look, the real issue is with 30,000 dead and 70,000 [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=243.12s)]
*  wounded and hundreds of thousands of children starving to death. I would hope [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=249.48s)]
*  that every sane American wants this war ended and ended right now. And that's the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=253.76s)]
*  role that the United States has got to play. And we have a special role because [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=258.76s)]
*  we have supported Israel for many, many years. $3.5 billion in military aid [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=262.64s)]
*  every year. And now there are those in Congress who want to give them another [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=267.24s)]
*  $10 billion to continue this war. So I think the goal right now is for us to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=271.4s)]
*  rally around the effort to say no more military aid for Netanyahu in this [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=275.84s)]
*  terrible war. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dszS9Nl5Cps&t=280.79999999999995s)]
