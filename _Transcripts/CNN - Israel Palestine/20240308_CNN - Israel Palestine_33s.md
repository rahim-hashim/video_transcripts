Video Description: A video obtained by CNN shows an airdrop of humanitarian aid into Gaza going wrong when the parachute on a pallet of aid malfunctions. The pallet and its contents can be seen falling rapidly toward residential buildings near the Fairoz Towers in western Gaza. The transport plane seen delivering the airdrop is a military Boeing C-17, although it was not immediately clear which air force was flying the mission. Despite some reports there were civilian deaths, the Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said those reports were false at a briefing. #CNN #News #Gaza #Israel
