# When Hamas attacked, this group of volunteers fought back and won
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE)
*  We succeeded to do what we were trading for, I think for years, but that's not exactly what we were trading for. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=0.0s)]
*  I mean, for years the fact that we have those squads in every kibbutz is to prevent like a small... [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=7.2s)]
*  to intercept a small group of terrorists maybe trying to do something very pinpointed, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=15.92s)]
*  not a full military assault with numbers, with dozens of terrorists coming to us with anti-tank. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=21.92s)]
*  How many were there altogether? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=29.76s)]
*  More than 30. The estimation is that around 35 terrorists were participating in the three assaults on the kibbutz. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=31.28s)]
*  It all began of course around 6.30 in the morning. You were sleeping, you and your wife. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=39.28s)]
*  Me and my wife on the second floor, we start to hear the missile and I said to my wife, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=45.28s)]
*  I think I hear a missile. She said, yeah, I hear this also. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=53.800000000000004s)]
*  So we run to the first floor and then we got a missile on the second floor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  To hit your house? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=62.8s)]
*  Yeah, come from the roof and blow everything. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=63.8s)]
*  And then the smoke start to go down, I open the boom shelter, run to the second floor to see if there is fire or something like this. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=65.8s)]
*  And I see that there is no fire. Suddenly I start to hear shooting all around. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=78.32s)]
*  I said to Avi, Avi, it's not normal. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=83.32s)]
*  Do you have radios or are you texting? How are you figuring out where each other... [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=86.32s)]
*  We have radios but quite in the beginning some of them were malfunctioning already. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=90.32s)]
*  So we were scouting the ground. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=94.83999999999999s)]
*  Exactly where everybody was and what happened. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=111.83999999999999s)]
*  Because it wasn't actually even going through. So afterwards it's ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  So you were really operating alone, each of you alone in a sense. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  Basically yes. At some points I had the connection, at some points most of them didn't have any connection. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=123.36s)]
*  The radios were... I didn't know they had a battle. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=130.36s)]
*  They were on the other side of the kibbutz. I couldn't hear them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=135.36s)]
*  Right, because there were three points. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=138.36s)]
*  I couldn't hear them. I had no idea they were in a battle until noon maybe. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=139.36s)]
*  Because I was on their gate. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=144.36s)]
*  But when you were at the gate, they tried to come in the vehicle gate. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=146.36s)]
*  And I know in Barry we saw all the burnout cars they used to block. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  You were able to stop that, but they burst through the pedestrian gate. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  And we have footage of some of this from the security cameras. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. They were actually shooting anti-tank missiles on the gate. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  So there's an actual carnage going on outside the gate. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=164.88000000000002s)]
*  People are trying to rush in from the party. People that were just driving. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  Right, they're trying to come in for safety. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  They're trying to come in. The gate is closed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=175.4s)]
*  They cannot see the terrorists. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=177.4s)]
*  They just go outside and run to the gate. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=179.4s)]
*  They're being shot at from short distance. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=181.4s)]
*  Fall down. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=183.4s)]
*  So the terrorists at the gate are trying to come in. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=184.4s)]
*  These people are rushing in. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=186.4s)]
*  So they're basically just picking them off as they run in. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=187.4s)]
*  The terrorists are actually taking cover around the gate from the outside. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=190.4s)]
*  And firing at them. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=193.4s)]
*  And firing at those civilians that are running to the gate. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=195.4s)]
*  Stabbing them after they were shot down to make sure they're dead. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=198.4s)]
*  They are engaging. There is a small MIG grenade, this bomb shelter. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  Outside the gate some of the party members were hiding there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  So you can see a group of terrorists going and doing their massacre there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  They throw hand grenades. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  Grenades into the shelter. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  You can see in the movie, the security movie, you can see the hand of the terrorists throw hand grenades inside. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  So I went out solo. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=227.44s)]
*  And started moving towards the main gate, but not in a straight line. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=231.44s)]
*  I went through the houses. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=238.44s)]
*  I got to parking lot number two. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=240.44s)]
*  And there is a hill, a small hill over watching it, but from outside. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=244.44s)]
*  And there were three guys wearing black. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=250.44s)]
*  Looking at the road. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=254.44s)]
*  I wasn't sure if this is our people or maybe I don't know what. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=256.96s)]
*  And the moment they turned around I saw AK-47s. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=260.96s)]
*  So that's how you know. Because you all have M16s. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=264.96s)]
*  All of you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=266.96s)]
*  We don't use AK-47s. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=268.96s)]
*  So you know, immediate signal that that's not us. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=270.96s)]
*  That's not us. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=272.96s)]
*  I shot at this group. One of them got hit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=274.96s)]
*  The other two scattered. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=276.96s)]
*  Do you have any idea how many... [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=279.96s)]
*  Obviously you have M16s, you have magazines. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=281.96s)]
*  But just a sense of this went on for hours. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  How many bullets did you even shoot? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  Do you have any idea of what this took? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  I shot hundreds. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  I shot 240 bullets. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=297.47999999999996s)]
*  I knew that I have only six magazines. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=301.47999999999996s)]
*  And I counted every bullet. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=304.47999999999996s)]
*  I knew that I cannot shoot like... [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  I have a backup or something like that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  So I've been shooting every bullet has its own target. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=315.0s)]
*  I didn't just to make them lie. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=321.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=325.0s)]
*  You had to shoot to kill. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=327.0s)]
*  I had to shoot to kill. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=329.0s)]
*  So I know you all know you've seen these. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=331.0s)]
*  This is what was found on them. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=333.0s)]
*  I mean, at least on somebody. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=335.0s)]
*  This is their plans of what they were going to do. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=337.0s)]
*  I just was reading through it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=341.0s)]
*  I mean, it's dated October 2022. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=344.52s)]
*  They were planning it for a whole year. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=348.52s)]
*  The details in here... [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=352.52s)]
*  Eli, I wanted to ask you about one specific thing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=354.52s)]
*  I mean, they knew everything about your... [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=356.52s)]
*  Except our names. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=358.52s)]
*  Except your names. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=360.52s)]
*  But they put their phone numbers in here. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=362.52s)]
*  They put the task, Kibbutz Mafasim, raid plan B-14. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=364.52s)]
*  I mean, it's military. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=368.52s)]
*  Very specified. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=370.52s)]
*  The Marder, Al-Kassam Brigade, they label it all. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  But at the top, they have the cameras that are going to be visible. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  Who was going to come to help you? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=379.03999999999996s)]
*  They knew the Tank Brigade. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  But it's this part I wanted to ask you all about. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  This was exactly what they planned to do inside the Kibbutz. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  The duty of where they were supposed to go. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  What street numbers, everything. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  They know where the generator is? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  Did you now that you see this and you saw them, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=395.03999999999996s)]
*  were they trying to execute this plan? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=399.03999999999996s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=401.56s)]
*  Their plan was actually to engage the security group [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=403.56s)]
*  to open the main gate to allow vehicles in, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=407.56s)]
*  to sabotage the main power and the generator, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=411.56s)]
*  and to make as much casualties from the security team [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=415.56s)]
*  to allow the second wave to go in. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=421.56s)]
*  And the fact that they know the exact street where to go to, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=424.56s)]
*  where the generator is and state of the art. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=429.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, street by street. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=431.08s)]
*  Street by street. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=433.08s)]
*  That's exactly what they were executing. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=435.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=437.08s)]
*  They came to the exact points where the gates are. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=439.08s)]
*  For instance, the point beside my house is the gate. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=441.08s)]
*  It's the southern gate. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=443.08s)]
*  It's a small gate that is closed. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=445.08s)]
*  It's in the plan. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=447.08s)]
*  I actually saw a page. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=449.08s)]
*  Which I saw too, with symbols. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=451.08s)]
*  Yeah, with actually arrows. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=453.08s)]
*  Gate, gate, gate. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=455.08s)]
*  I mean, I mean, I think about it, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  that they didn't just plan and train. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is military. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is... [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  How do you even react to that? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  This took... [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the date's October 2022. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  It's terrifying because it is a military plan [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  that the combatants, the terrorists trained on it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  It was quite clear they knew exactly what they were doing. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=479.59999999999997s)]
*  They were disciplined. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=482.59999999999997s)]
*  Military-grade planning. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=484.6s)]
*  Very terrifying. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=486.6s)]
*  Military-grade information. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=488.6s)]
*  To make this plan, you need inside information. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=490.6s)]
*  A lot of information. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=494.6s)]
*  It's not only Google Earth. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=496.6s)]
*  We know that many people from Gaza, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=498.6s)]
*  also from the West Bank, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=500.6s)]
*  come to the Kibbutz to work. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=502.6s)]
*  And to build a house. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=504.6s)]
*  Inside house. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=506.6s)]
*  Always, it's a routine. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=508.6s)]
*  So all these plans are very specific, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=510.6s)]
*  very information from inside. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=513.6s)]
*  Someone that comes to the Kibbutz every day, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=515.6s)]
*  take photos, make locations, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=517.6s)]
*  and give information to the... [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=520.6s)]
*  I mean, the faction advances from Street 49, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=523.6s)]
*  then Street 50, then the junction, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=526.6s)]
*  Klobal, Mafasim's Gate. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=528.6s)]
*  This is the numbers they gave. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=530.6s)]
*  The number of cameras inside the Kibbutz. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=532.6s)]
*  You cannot see it from outside. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=534.6s)]
*  You cannot see it from... [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=536.6s)]
*  So they would have had to have someone. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=538.6s)]
*  That does list all the surveillance. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=540.6s)]
*  I don't know the cameras inside the Kibbutz. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=542.6s)]
*  I don't know the cameras. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=544.6s)]
*  I don't know where the cameras are. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=546.6s)]
*  I don't know where they are. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=548.6s)]
*  I cannot tell each and every camera. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=550.6s)]
*  But they do. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=552.6s)]
*  Indeed, you. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=554.6s)]
*  So we tend to think like, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=556.6s)]
*  Nom does... [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=558.6s)]
*  He did it to give some information for me inside the Kibbutz. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=560.6s)]
*  But you saw outside your gates what happened. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=562.6s)]
*  So the world understands. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=566.6s)]
*  Can you just talk about what happened? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=568.6s)]
*  What you saw? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=570.6s)]
*  I mean, just... [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=572.6s)]
*  Massacre. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=574.6s)]
*  In every sense of the word, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=576.6s)]
*  massacre, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=578.6s)]
*  bloodthirst. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=582.6s)]
*  It's not just, okay, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=584.6s)]
*  target killing is down, continue. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=586.6s)]
*  No, no. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=588.6s)]
*  They butchered. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=590.6s)]
*  It was [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=592.6s)]
*  barbaric in every sense. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=594.6s)]
*  There's no need to fire 50 rounds [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=596.6s)]
*  at a guy that's already dead on the floor. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=598.6s)]
*  Okay? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=600.6s)]
*  There's no need for it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=602.6s)]
*  I can tell you that one of the most [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=604.6s)]
*  terrible, I think, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=606.6s)]
*  few minutes [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=608.6s)]
*  in this day [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=610.6s)]
*  was actually when we went out of the Kibbutz. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=612.6s)]
*  Me and David, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=614.6s)]
*  families, we went out of the Kibbutz [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=616.6s)]
*  at about 3.30 in the morning. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=618.6s)]
*  And there was no electricity also on the road. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=620.6s)]
*  Meaning, it was complete darkness. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=622.6s)]
*  And we went outside [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=624.6s)]
*  the gate of our house. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=626.6s)]
*  They immediately told us, drive very fast, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=628.6s)]
*  only to the north. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=630.6s)]
*  And we were driving like crazy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=632.6s)]
*  And from the gates, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=634.6s)]
*  we told immediately the children, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=636.6s)]
*  you are lying down on the floor, don't look out of the windows. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=638.6s)]
*  In front of the gate, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=640.6s)]
*  there were burnt cars, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=642.6s)]
*  dozens of bodies. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=644.6s)]
*  Apocalyptic view, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=646.6s)]
*  as you can imagine it. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=648.6s)]
*  In sheer darkness, we were driving on the road, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=650.6s)]
*  which is the driving way to our home. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=652.6s)]
*  It's the normal life. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=654.6s)]
*  Everyday. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=656.6s)]
*  We've been riding like that between dead bodies. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYhUr70aXZE&t=658.6s)]
