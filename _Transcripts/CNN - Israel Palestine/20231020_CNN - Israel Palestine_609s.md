# Two American hostages being released by Hamas, sources say
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo)
*  We do want to bring you some breaking news though right now. CNN's Alex Marquardt has that for us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=0.0s)]
*  Alex, this has to do with the hostages that were being held in Gaza by Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=5.36s)]
*  Yeah, Boris and Brianna, we understand that two of the American hostages who have been held by Hamas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=10.72s)]
*  are on their way out of the Gaza Strip. We've just learned this from a person who is familiar [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  with the discussions as well as a diplomatic source who's spoken to my colleague Caitlin Collins. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=22.16s)]
*  As we know from the Israelis, there have been around 200 hostages who have been held [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=27.04s)]
*  by that militant group, by Hamas, since the horrific attacks inside Israel on October 7th. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=32.48s)]
*  What we understand from these two sources is that the two Americans are a mother and a daughter. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=38.4s)]
*  They are currently, we're told, with the Red Cross and heading south in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  There are two crossings in southern Gaza, one that goes into Egypt, the other that goes into Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=50.8s)]
*  Right now, we're not sure about which country they will be going into. We're also unclear on [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=56.8s)]
*  the identities of this mother and child, but we are told that they are being released on humanitarian [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=62.88s)]
*  grounds. That's according to a source that I spoke with because the mother is not in good health. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=69.68s)]
*  Now, Boris and Brianna, this has also been announced by Hamas. A spokesman for the militant [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=75.68s)]
*  group said that the mother and daughter are also being released, they say, on humanitarian [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=81.52s)]
*  grounds, but also because they want to contest the claims being made by Biden and what they call his [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=86.56s)]
*  fascist administration because they are false and baseless. So we have this mother and daughter, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=94.88s)]
*  American citizens, who have been held by Hamas for much of the past two weeks. Now we understand [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  with the Red Cross on their way out of Gaza. Guys? Alex, to clarify quickly the next steps, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=107.44s)]
*  is it clear exactly where they're headed next? Is it going to be Egypt or Israel? What do we know? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=115.12s)]
*  No, there are two crossings, two gates in the southern part of Gaza, one called Karam Shalom, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=121.52s)]
*  which is between Gaza and Israel, and the other one, Rafah, which we've been talking about so much [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  because of the question about aid, and that is where the aid would go from Egypt into Gaza. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=131.28s)]
*  So right now it is not clear, Boris. Certainly they were abducted in Israel, we know that, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  so there is, of course, a good chance that they could be then taken back into Israel. But at the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  same time, it may just be easier for whatever reason, logistics, operationally security, to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=150.64s)]
*  have them go into Egypt. But I think one of the important points is now they're with an independent [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=157.04s)]
*  party. They're with the Red Cross. And so that is the best news. They are no longer, we understand, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=163.44s)]
*  in Hamas custody, although of course Hamas does control the entire Gaza Strip. So this is not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=170.16s)]
*  a done deal. Things are still obviously extremely fluid. But here we have both our sources outside [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=176.48s)]
*  of Gaza, as well as Hamas themselves saying that these two Americans are being released. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=184.4s)]
*  All right, Alex, I want to bring in Caitlin Collins, who is in Tel Aviv. The two of you [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=190.56s)]
*  reported this story out. Caitlin, is there anything, and I don't even know if there's an [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=194.56s)]
*  answer to this at this point, but can we read into anything at this point? If they're being released [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=199.04s)]
*  because the mother is in poor health, could this be an acknowledgement on the part of Hamas that [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=205.12s)]
*  they need to perhaps release people who are not doing well? That they want people who maybe are [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=212.08s)]
*  in good health, if they are going to be using them as pawns as they perhaps later try to utilize [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=218.48s)]
*  them in some kind of prisoner exchange? Can we read into anything at this point? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=224.72s)]
*  I think a lot of that remains to be seen. I mean, this was a big question once Hamas had captured [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  so many of these hostages and taken them out into Gaza after that October 7th attack. That was a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=235.76s)]
*  question, was if they are going to try to use them as we had seen in the past when Hamas had kidnapped [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  an IDF officer that there was a lot of negotiation over that. It took years and in the end, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=246.88s)]
*  Israel released, I believe, about a thousand Palestinian prisoners in exchange for that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  Israeli officer. And so that was kind of the basis that people were looking at these hostages and the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=257.92s)]
*  questions over what would happen here. And we've heard Israeli officials say they were not negotiating [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=263.52s)]
*  with Hamas for an exchange for the hostages. But this news is incredibly significant. I mean, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=268.64s)]
*  these hostages, of course, there's been an open question of what their fate would be, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=273.91999999999996s)]
*  what would happen, especially as we are waiting to see that ground incursion potentially happen. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  And I can just tell you, we have not heard anything from the prime minister's office here [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=282.4s)]
*  in Tel Aviv tonight on the release of these two American hostages that Alex and I [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=286.32s)]
*  have reporting on. They have not confirmed it. We are waiting to see what they say about this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=290.96s)]
*  We also have not heard from the White House on this front either. But I just want to tell you, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=295.52s)]
*  this is something that is still every single day here in Tel Aviv, everywhere in Israel, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=299.12s)]
*  this is something that everyone's talking about. Of course, Shabbat happens on Friday evenings. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  This is when everyone, their family, their friends get together and have a dinner in the Jewish faith. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=308.8s)]
*  And earlier, we went to this ceremony for all of these families of these hostages. And they had this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  incredibly long dining table set up with a seat for every person who is believed to have been [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=320.24s)]
*  taken hostage by Hamas and therefore will not be with their families for Shabbat dinner. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=325.36s)]
*  And it was an incredibly emotional moment. And so just this news in and of itself that two of them [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=330.0s)]
*  have been released that they are alive is something that is going to be hopeful to these [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=336.32s)]
*  families who are waiting for any piece, any scrap of information about their loved ones. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=341.12s)]
*  And so, of course, the question remains, what happens to the other hostages? What does that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=346.16s)]
*  look like going forward? I think there are still so many questions for these two American [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=349.92s)]
*  hostages that are being released, including where they are going to be released into, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=354.8s)]
*  whether that's Egypt, whether that's here into Israel. Those are still big questions, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=358.88s)]
*  and we're still waiting for details over what that looks like. And also, Brianna, as you mentioned, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=362.88s)]
*  what it could mean for the others and how Hamas plans to use them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=367.04s)]
*  One other thing I will say that we talked about last night, and this was in an interview with [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=370.56s)]
*  The New York Times, Hamas leader said that they are not even in control over all the hostages, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=374.64s)]
*  that there are other terrorist groups, obviously, in Gaza, and they did not have full control over [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=379.76s)]
*  them. Obviously something that would complicate getting the release of these other hostages. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=384.64s)]
*  Caitlin, please stand by. We want to bring in Jim Shuto now, because, Jim, you just spoke to a [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=389.68s)]
*  longtime hostage representative. That's right. I spoke to Jonathan Franks, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=393.6s)]
*  sure you've spoken with him before. He's been involved, for instance, in the release of the [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=397.44s)]
*  American Trevor Reed from Russia. He also worked on the Travis King case in North Korea. And I [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=400.4s)]
*  asked him what, in his experience, a release like this might indicate. He said, given the number of [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=406.08s)]
*  hostages that Hamas is holding, to release two could be an attempt just to relieve the pressure [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=411.35999999999996s)]
*  somewhat. I mean, you're in the midst of a quite aggressive, devastating Israeli air campaign [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  threat of a ground offensive, demands for humanitarian supplies. To relieve the pressure [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=421.91999999999996s)]
*  does not necessarily portend that all the hostages are going to be freed quickly. He makes the point, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=427.92s)]
*  and Caitlin made this point as well, that in previous hostage exchanges with Hamas, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  they've demanded a great deal in return, particularly when it involves a soldier. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=439.04s)]
*  For instance, Gilad Shalip, a thousand Palestinian prisoners were released. So it may be, as you look [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=443.52000000000004s)]
*  at this, that you have different kinds of hostages. Here's a mother and daughter, apparently the mother [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=449.68s)]
*  in ill health. They can make the case that this is more of a humanitarian case. For soldiers, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=454.88s)]
*  they might deal differently. For men of military age, they might deal differently as well. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=460.88s)]
*  But again, Hamas is a group that takes hostages. Hamas is a group that kills civilians. We don't [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=467.68s)]
*  need more evidence of that. A decision like this does not mean Hamas has changed. It means that it [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=472.56s)]
*  sees something, it wants something in return, or it sees this as being in their advantage. And perhaps [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=477.92s)]
*  there was some pressure applied from outside as well. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=483.68s)]
*  Yeah. And Alex, I understand you have some information about how this negotiation went down. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, Jim's absolutely right in terms of the pressure being applied from outside. Hamas [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=492.16s)]
*  is considered a terrorist organization, of course, by not just Israel, but the United States as well. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=496.0s)]
*  And that means that those two countries don't have direct dialogue with Hamas. So in this situation, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=500.56s)]
*  and this has been the case for much of the past two weeks since these 200 or so people were taken, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=505.6s)]
*  is that it was primarily Qatar that was engaging with Hamas. They are the main conduit for [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=510.16s)]
*  Israel and the U.S. to talk to that militant group. Qatar has several Hamas leaders who live in their [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=517.6s)]
*  capital in Doha. So this really has been the portfolio that the U.S. has asked Qatar to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=524.24s)]
*  undertake. When Secretary Antony Blinken was crisscrossing the region going to all these [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=530.4s)]
*  different Middle Eastern countries, he very quickly went to Qatar, and that was because they have this [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  direct line into Hamas. And so here this is, both according to the sources that we have spoken with, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  but also Hamas themselves, the result of this negotiation between Hamas and Qatar. But no doubt, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  the presence of these still around 200 hostages who will still be in the custody of Hamas and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  other groups we understand or subgroups all across the Gaza Strip, that is going to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=562.64s)]
*  wildly complicate the efforts of the Israeli military, who of course we believe are going to [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=567.84s)]
*  go into Gaza on the ground any day now. We've been talking about this sprawling network of [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=573.28s)]
*  tunnels throughout the Gaza Strip. We understand that the hostages may be in those tunnels, may [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=578.08s)]
*  be in the bunkers. And so as Israel goes in to try to decapitate the Hamas military and political [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=582.48s)]
*  leadership, not only are they trying to minimize the civilian death toll on the Palestinian side, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=588.48s)]
*  but they're obviously trying to make sure that nothing happens to these hostages and try to get [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=593.2s)]
*  them out. So while Israel is saying that they're not going to be negotiating with Hamas over these [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=598.48s)]
*  hostages, this effort by Qatar will be ongoing to try to get more than just these two Americans out. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hh0yIQ0zoo&t=603.36s)]
