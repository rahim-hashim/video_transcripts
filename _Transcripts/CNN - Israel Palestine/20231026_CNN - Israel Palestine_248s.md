# Before and after satellite images show destruction in Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA)
*  We're also following another major story this morning, earlier this morning, smoke billowing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=0.0s)]
*  over Gaza after an airstrike, as seen from Starrot Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Israel says they conducted a targeted raid with tanks inside northern Gaza before withdrawing, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=8.5s)]
*  you can see in this video published by the IDF armored vehicles, including a bulldozer, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=13.0s)]
*  which Israel says is part of the preparations for the next stage of combat. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=17.52s)]
*  In these, new satellite images show significant destruction across Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=21.8s)]
*  On the left, an image from October 10th, on the right, just 11 days later. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=25.76s)]
*  You can see how much is flattened there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  This all comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke yesterday about his plans [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=32.52s)]
*  for a ground incursion. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=37.28s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=38.44s)]
*  We are raining down hellfire on Hamas. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=42.28s)]
*  We have already eliminated thousands of terrorists. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=45.32s)]
*  And this is only the beginning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  At the same time, we are preparing for a ground incursion. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=50.96s)]
*  I will not detail when, how, or how many, or the overall consideration that we are taking [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=54.92s)]
*  into account, most of which are unknown to the public. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  And this is how it needs to be in order to safeguard the lives of our soldiers. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=64.92s)]
*  Anne Burnett joins us from Jerusalem. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=71.64s)]
*  Erin, there was a big set of movements on the ground overnight, and I'm wondering how [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  significant that was, especially in the context of what we just heard the Prime Minister say. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=77.18s)]
*  Very significant, Papi. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=83.92s)]
*  And in fact, in this war, the most significant assault on Gaza thus far. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=84.92s)]
*  In fact, it may be the most significant ground assault by Israel on Gaza in the past decade. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=88.6s)]
*  So it does show very much a move to the next stage. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=92.8s)]
*  The forces went in. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=96.28s)]
*  They did come out after conducting their operations. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=97.28s)]
*  They said they killed numerous terrorists. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=99.84s)]
*  They did not give an exact number. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Also anti-tank searching, anti-tank mine searching, I'm sorry, as they went through that rubble [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=103.72s)]
*  in northern Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=109.0s)]
*  But this is the first time in in a significant way, could be the biggest in a decade. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=110.0s)]
*  We do know special forces obviously have been in Gaza, but this is a significant shift overnight. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=113.68s)]
*  And the reality of it is, of course, when you look at those images before and after, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  it has been reduced to rubble. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=125.0s)]
*  We've compared it to what even you see in a place like Bakmout. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=126.56s)]
*  But the reality of it is, is the pre and post, you can see already what Israel has accomplished [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=129.84s)]
*  in its war as it sees it through these strikes, thousands of strikes just over these past [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=135.04000000000002s)]
*  three weeks that we have been covering this war. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=139.88s)]
*  And they did release that video. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=142.52s)]
*  Of course, we should emphasize when you get a view of the front line here, that video [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  is coming from the IDF. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=147.44s)]
*  They have not provided the access for journalists to actually see that and witness that ourselves. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  Phil and Poppy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=154.28s)]
*  Aaron, the split screen of that you're looking at right now of the two different timelines [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=155.28s)]
*  for Gaza underscores the acute nature of the debate, the ongoing intensive debate related [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=161.08s)]
*  to humanitarian aid. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  The UN said it's almost run out of fuel at scaling back humanitarian operations. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=168.08s)]
*  What's the latest as efforts to try and expand it seem to continue to run in roadblocks? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  Use the word acute. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=180.84s)]
*  And I think that's the right word. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=181.84s)]
*  The UN had said that they could run out of all necessary supplies for any humanitarian [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=182.84s)]
*  assistance overnight. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=187.0s)]
*  We are now obviously in the early afternoon here in Israel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=188.56s)]
*  They say that they are now rationing fuel, that that is giving them a bit more of time, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=191.12s)]
*  that means obviously a lot of people are not getting what they need. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  Hospitals have already been shut down, many of them from being able to provide essential [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=200.28s)]
*  services. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=203.6s)]
*  The UN uses the word paralyzed to describe the situation that they're facing on the ground. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=204.6s)]
*  I was talking to a pediatrician, an American, the exhaustion in her voice. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  She said one toilet for 800 people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  And just that image, of course, is hard to describe. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  You can imagine the lines. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=220.32s)]
*  You can imagine what that means. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=221.83999999999997s)]
*  You can imagine the disease. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=223.0s)]
*  And that is what an American pediatrician is experiencing along that Rafa border crossing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=224.32s)]
*  It is obviously significantly worse in the north and the Israeli airstrikes, as you know, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=229.64s)]
*  while they have decimated the north, also strike areas in communists and closer to Rafa [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=234.2s)]
*  in the Israeli airstrikes. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Hours long bread lines and the humanitarian crisis is dire here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=240.48s)]
*  They are rationing fuel, as we understand at this moment. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=243.62s)]
*  Phil and Papi. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=246.04s)]
*  All right, Aaron Bernat, with the latest. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1kQKDZ2NA&t=247.04s)]
