# 'A bird in heaven': Grandfather cradles 7-year-old granddaughter killed in southern Gaza
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo)
*  CNN's Nada Bashir reports on the latest bloodshed in Gaza, and we must warn you, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=0.0s)]
*  some of what you're about to see is difficult to watch. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=4.48s)]
*  There are simply no words. This grandfather cradling the body of his seven-year-old granddaughter, Ataf. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=10.24s)]
*  Beside the shallow grave where she will soon be buried. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=20.88s)]
*  I told her mother that Ataf is now a bird in heaven, Ahmed says, with her aunt, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=23.92s)]
*  her cousin and her grandmother, who were all waiting for her. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=31.68s)]
*  You see, we have many martyrs in our family. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=35.28s)]
*  Ahmed says his family had been taking shelter in a school in Khan Younis when an airstrike hit. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=42.8s)]
*  It took hours, he says, to reach the nearest hospital still able to treat little Ataf. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=48.72s)]
*  But it was too late. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=55.44s)]
*  Across Gaza, more than 10,000 children have been killed since the war began, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=60.8s)]
*  according to the Hamas-run health ministry. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  Many more left orphaned or facing life-changing injuries. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=70.16s)]
*  In the central city of Deir el-Balah, the airstrikes are near daily. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=74.16s)]
*  Those who survive left to dig through the rubble with their bare hands in search of their loved ones. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=81.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Rafah, once deemed a safe zone, UNICEF estimates that there are now more than [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=90.56s)]
*  600,000 children among the over a million people in the area, many taking shelter in [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=96.72s)]
*  these sprawling tent cities. The southern city has, for weeks, come under relentless airstrikes [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=103.36s)]
*  by the Israeli military, who say they are targeting Hamas. But now a looming ground operation [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=112.0s)]
*  is stoking fears that Rafah could become, as one aid group has described it, a zone of bloodshed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=119.28s)]
*  If by some misfortune there is an invasion of Rafah, two-thirds of the population will die, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=125.84s)]
*  Jabir says. We can't get out of Rafah. We have no other alternative. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=133.6s)]
*  Israel says it is now calling for a mass evacuation of civilians in the southern city [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=138.88s)]
*  ahead of a planned ground offensive. But it is almost impossible to fathom where else these [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=144.32s)]
*  civilians can turn to. But Rafah has not only become a vital lifeline for the displaced, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=150.24s)]
*  it is also a crucial gateway for humanitarian aid crossing over from Egypt. And many in the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=158.88s)]
*  international community are now sounding alarm bells over Israel's warning. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  And I'm especially alarmed by reports that the Israeli military intends to focus next on Rafah, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=170.0s)]
*  where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been squeezed in a desperate search for safety. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=175.92s)]
*  The US State Department has warned that it cannot support an Israeli military operation in Rafah [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=183.04s)]
*  without serious planning for civilians there, with US President Joe Biden on Thursday [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=188.0s)]
*  describing Israel's actions in Gaza as, quote, over the top. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=193.68s)]
*  But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already dismissed a proposal from Hamas [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=198.16s)]
*  for a prolonged truce, which would see a phased withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=206.4s)]
*  and a gradual release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=211.76s)]
*  Netanyahu, who described the proposal as delusional, has vowed to push ahead until a, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=217.44s)]
*  quote, complete victory over Hamas is achieved, leaving little hope for diplomacy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=223.2s)]
*  as negotiations continue and little hope for what lies ahead in Gaza. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pgFrmNgjUo&t=229.67999999999998s)]
