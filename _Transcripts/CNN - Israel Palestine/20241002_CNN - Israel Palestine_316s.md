# CNN witnesses explosions over Beirut
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE)
*  A short time ago, our CNN team witnessed explosions over Tel Aviv in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's military has now confirmed it intercepted a suspicious aerial target off the coast of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=3.94s)]
*  central Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=8.0s)]
*  Also late tonight in Beirut, Lebanon, our CNN team there witnessed other explosions, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=9.36s)]
*  this one in central Beirut. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=13.88s)]
*  Lebanon's health ministry says at least six people were killed. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=15.9s)]
*  Explosions were also witnessed in Beirut's southern suburbs tonight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=18.8s)]
*  Israel has expanded its presence in southern Lebanon with thousands more troops. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=22.56s)]
*  And as Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year begins, still no answer to the question how [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=26.24s)]
*  Israel will respond to yesterday's ballistic missile attack by Iran. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=30.0s)]
*  President Biden today said he'll speak with Israeli Prime Minister relatively soon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=34.28s)]
*  He also says he doesn't support an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=38.12s)]
*  Nick Robertson is in Tel Aviv tonight. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=42.4s)]
*  Israel's long slog into Lebanon turning deadly for the IDF on its second day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=48.16s)]
*  The limited localized targeted raids, as the IDF characterizes them, triggering fierce [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=55.38s)]
*  resistance. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=61.82s)]
*  Helicopters inside Israel picking up the casualties. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=65.10000000000001s)]
*  A nearby trauma hospital declaring a mass casualty event. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=68.26s)]
*  The IDF confirming eight dead and several others injured. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=74.38s)]
*  In attacks, Hezbollah claims took place in three villages. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=78.6s)]
*  As earlier, overlooking the area of at least one of the attacks. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=84.06s)]
*  Jabel Blatt and behind it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=88.22s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=91.86s)]
*  Israeli border resident Rosh Hashanah already worrying about the troops. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=92.86s)]
*  I think that it's very dangerous to the army to go to Lebanon because many, many tramps [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=99.94s)]
*  waiting for them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=107.58s)]
*  She refused to evacuate last year, was busy preparing the troops holiday dinner for Rosh [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=109.3s)]
*  Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=115.62s)]
*  And hopeful their raids would bring her respite from Hezbollah attacks. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=119.42s)]
*  I feel more safe. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=124.66s)]
*  I feel more protected because the army inside. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=126.3s)]
*  The whole country, however, entering a new era of uncertainty following Iran's ballistic [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  missile attack Tuesday. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=138.94s)]
*  The United States and other allies blunting the impact, intercepting the majority of the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  fast long range high explosive ballistic missiles. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=150.78s)]
*  Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  We will stand by the rule established. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=160.78s)]
*  Whoever attacks us, we will attack them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  Israeli officials say all the bases targeted are fully operational, including their long [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=166.54s)]
*  range combat mission airfield, the scale of Israel's response, likely determining the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  pace of escalation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=181.54s)]
*  Israel's combat operations on other fronts continuing uninterrupted. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=187.22s)]
*  Palestinian health officials claiming Israeli strikes killed more than 90 Palestinians in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=192.06s)]
*  Gaza Wednesday as a new operation against Hamas opened up in Hanyounis. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=198.14000000000001s)]
*  In Syria, smoke rising after a strike near Damascus unclaimed by Israel, but blamed on [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=206.82000000000002s)]
*  them by Syrian state media. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=214.06s)]
*  Air strikes continuing deeper into Lebanon, too, targets in Beirut and beyond. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=217.34s)]
*  Civilians in parts of the capital warned by the IDF to evacuate their homes as the country's [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  death toll passes 1300 and a million people displaced. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=230.06s)]
*  Nick Robertson joins us. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=236.74s)]
*  Now, what have you seen in Tel Aviv tonight? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=237.74s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen what appeared to be intercepts of some kind of missile or drone out to sea. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=241.66s)]
*  These were not the sort of intercepts where you have multiple launches up into the sky [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=249.7s)]
*  where they're going really high. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=254.74s)]
*  This was sort of more straight out, which makes us think it was probably a drone. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=256.71999999999997s)]
*  But there were several of them, several launches of the intercept, several explosions we heard [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=261.54s)]
*  in the distance some time apart, maybe a minute or two minutes between the different explosions. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=267.5s)]
*  So very hard to say. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=273.94s)]
*  The IDF is saying that they intercepted a suspicious aerial vehicle out to sea. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=276.94s)]
*  We heard fighter jets as well at one point out over the sea just here and helicopters [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=282.9s)]
*  as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=288.72s)]
*  Now, the IDF says, and this is correct, they don't normally sound alarms when the threat [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=289.72s)]
*  is out over the sea. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=294.22s)]
*  But it's not often that we've seen drones coming in off the water onto Tel Aviv. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=295.94s)]
*  A Huthy drone perhaps a couple of months ago did impact here coming in off the sea. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=302.46s)]
*  So not clear precisely what was being targeted, where it was coming from, who was it that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=308.5s)]
*  was targeting Tel Aviv. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSoVA-DHubE&t=314.14s)]
