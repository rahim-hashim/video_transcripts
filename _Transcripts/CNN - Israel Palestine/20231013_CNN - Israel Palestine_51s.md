*  Sirens are going off, which has not occurred here for really today, certainly, or the last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=0.0s)]
*  several days. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=9.4s)]
*  They're quite extensive sirens. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=10.4s)]
*  You hear them all over Tel Aviv right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=11.4s)]
*  This just started about 15 seconds, maybe 30 seconds ago, so it remains to be seen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  If rockets do come, generally they come from that direction. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=20.76s)]
*  That sounded like an Iron Dome interception. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=26.24s)]
*  That was a rather large explosion. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=33.56s)]
*  That is something we have not heard very much here in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=36.72s)]
*  No, I think we're fine in this location. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=40.0s)]
*  Matthew, what do you think? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=42.599999999999994s)]
*  Was that an Iron Dome interception? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=44.32s)]
*  Hard to tell. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=45.32s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=46.32s)]
*  I mean, I haven't heard anything like that in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=47.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=49.32s)]
*  Not since I've been here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6MIsq2voU&t=50.32s)]
