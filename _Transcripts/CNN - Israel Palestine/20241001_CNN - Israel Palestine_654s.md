# Video shows Israel and Hezbollah trading strikes during IDF's ground operation
**CNN - Israel Palestine:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I)
*  And this is a live look at Beirut as we speak. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=0.0s)]
*  You can see a thick haze is hanging over the city there [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  after overnight Israeli airstrikes. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=8.32s)]
*  And some 200 kilometers up the coast [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  from where we are here in southern Lebanon, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=13.6s)]
*  Israel has started what it calls [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  a limited ground operation, sending in paratroopers, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=18.8s)]
*  commandos, and members of the armored corps. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=22.52s)]
*  The Israeli military says it is conducting, quote, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=25.64s)]
*  targeted raids at the Israeli-Lebanese border. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=28.92s)]
*  Israel says there will be no long-term occupation [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=32.04s)]
*  of southern Lebanon. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=35.72s)]
*  Lebanese state media says strikes are underway [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=38.6s)]
*  at this hour in southern Lebanon, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=43.0s)]
*  and those attacks are causing severe damage. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  Meantime, Hezbollah says it has targeted parts [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=47.96s)]
*  of northern Israel during the early morning hours. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=50.88s)]
*  The US says Israel informed it of a number of operations, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  including the ground incursion. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=58.68s)]
*  The US National Security Council spokesperson tells CNN [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=61.84s)]
*  that the mission can be a risk, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=64.68s)]
*  a risk of mission creep, as you will. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=67.12s)]
*  And the White House will keep discussing that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=69.6s)]
*  with the Israelis. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=71.56s)]
*  Right, CNN's Paula Hancock is in Abu Dhabi, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=73.52s)]
*  and she has been monitoring what is going on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=75.88s)]
*  both over Beirut and in southern Lebanon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  And obviously, this is a fast-moving story. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=81.4s)]
*  Paula, the announcement, at least, of the ground invasion [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=84.0s)]
*  coming around 2 a.m. local time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  We are now some hours into that operation. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=89.08s)]
*  What further detail do we have? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=91.08s)]
*  Well, Becky, we have a team on the border [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=95.76s)]
*  saying that they had been seeing in those early hours [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=98.48s)]
*  flashes of light they had heard, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=102.48s)]
*  the artillery fire in southern Lebanon. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=104.56s)]
*  We've heard from state-run media, NNA, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=107.16s)]
*  that there has been severe damage, as they describe it, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=109.76s)]
*  in some of the villages at this point, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=113.28s)]
*  saying that there's been damage to shops, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  to private houses, and also to crops. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=118.84s)]
*  So as it is now light in those areas, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=122.16s)]
*  we should get more information [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=125.08s)]
*  about what the impact on the ground has been. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  But we've heard from the Israeli side [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=129.68s)]
*  that the military's saying that they had been training [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=131.08s)]
*  for this for months, saying also that they had gained skill [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=133.16s)]
*  and operational experience from what they have been doing [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=137.72s)]
*  over recent months in Gaza. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=141.4s)]
*  They have described it as a limited [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  and a targeted operation in southern Lebanon. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=146.08s)]
*  The Israeli military's saying that they will be focusing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=149.88s)]
*  on a number of villages just across the border [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=152.2s)]
*  in southern Lebanon, areas where they say [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=155.76s)]
*  Hezbollah operatives are based, have been operating out of, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  and where they believe that there is Hezbollah infrastructure. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=161.6s)]
*  Now, they have called it limited. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=166.28s)]
*  There are, of course, concerns in Lebanon [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=167.88s)]
*  that it may become more than what Israel says it is. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=172.0s)]
*  They, the Israeli military, understandably, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  would not be drawn on how long this might last, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=181.0s)]
*  how deep into Lebanon they may go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=183.36s)]
*  But certainly in the past, in 1982, for example, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=186.32s)]
*  Israel described a limited invasion, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=189.72s)]
*  and that ended as a bloody 18-year occupation. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=193.16s)]
*  And just recently, when Israel said [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=196.8s)]
*  it would carry out a limited offensive in Rafah [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=198.92s)]
*  in the south of Gaza, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=202.2s)]
*  amid international condemnation and opposition, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=204.44s)]
*  that ended up as a significant operation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  where much of the city is now unrecognizable, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=211.4s)]
*  as described by foreign media, including CNN, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=215.48s)]
*  which was taken there by the IDF. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=218.12s)]
*  So there are concerns about how significant [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=220.8s)]
*  this operation could be. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=223.44s)]
*  We heard from the US side, the US President Joe Biden, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=225.0s)]
*  just hours before it started, calling again for a ceasefire. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=228.12s)]
*  But we have since heard that Lloyd Austin, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=232.08s)]
*  the US Defense Secretary, has spoken to Yoav Galant, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=234.52s)]
*  the Israeli Defense Minister. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  And he has posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=240.24s)]
*  I'll read you his comments, quote, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=243.48000000000002s)]
*  we agreed on the necessity of dismantling [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  attack infrastructure along the border [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=249.24s)]
*  to ensure that Lebanese Hezbollah [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=251.56s)]
*  cannot conduct October 7th-style attacks [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  on Israel's northern communities. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=256.20000000000005s)]
*  I reaffirmed that a diplomatic resolution [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  is required to ensure that civilians [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  can return safely to their homes [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=262.16s)]
*  on both sides of the border there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  So saying they do say Israel has a right to self-defense, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  but they would prefer a diplomatic response. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=271.6s)]
*  Becky. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=274.40000000000003s)]
*  Paula Hancock's on the story for you with the very latest. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=277.44000000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Paula. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=280.56s)]
*  Well, Malcolm Davis is a senior analyst [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  for Defense Strategy and Capability [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=283.88s)]
*  at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=286.08s)]
*  and he joins us live now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=288.52s)]
*  Firstly, your assessment of what you have heard [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  and seen reported to date. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  We are some seven or so hours after the announcement [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=297.08s)]
*  of the ground offensive, incursion, invasion, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=301.35999999999996s)]
*  call it what you will, by Israeli troops, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  albeit they suggest limited in scope. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  How do you assess what you are seeing to date? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=311.8s)]
*  Well, certainly I think that the goal [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=315.24s)]
*  of the Israeli Defense Forces on the ground [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=316.8s)]
*  in this grounding incursion is to push Hezbollah forces [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=319.76s)]
*  back to the Latani River on the other side of that river [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=323.8s)]
*  to create a buffer zone, which is free of Hezbollah forces, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  particularly in terms of their ability [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=332.48s)]
*  to use short-range artillery, such as mortars and rockets, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=334.88s)]
*  so that sort of thing, so that Israeli citizens [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=338.48s)]
*  can return to northern Israel, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=341.72s)]
*  to their towns and villages there. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=344.28000000000003s)]
*  And in doing so, basically create a safe sector [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  from which Israel can then prevent Hezbollah [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=351.64000000000004s)]
*  from infiltrating close to the border. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  At the same time, you're seeing Israeli airstrikes continue, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  both in support of that ground incursion, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=361.88000000000005s)]
*  but also more directly against longer-range, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=363.44000000000005s)]
*  more distant targets, such as continuing attacks [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=367.68s)]
*  on Hezbollah rockets and battlefield missiles. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=370.64s)]
*  The White House has said that it supports Israel's right [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=377.28s)]
*  to defend itself from terror organizations, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=381.56s)]
*  very specifically, it said, Iran-backed terror organizations. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=384.32s)]
*  It also, at the same time, says it worries [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=387.68s)]
*  about mission creeps, so I guess that begs the question here, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  for how long does this go on? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=395.2s)]
*  What's the scope of this operation? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  Let's talk about what the threat is. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=401.24s)]
*  There have been some 9,300 launches by Hezbollah on Israel [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=404.28000000000003s)]
*  since October the 8th, the day after the terrible massacre [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=409.0s)]
*  of people in Israel by Hamas. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  October the 8th was the first time that Hezbollah, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=417.6s)]
*  in this conflict, launched strikes on Israel. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=420.72s)]
*  What's the capacity of the terror group? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=425.8s)]
*  And let's remind ourselves, they are, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=429.48s)]
*  as far as at least their communications [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=431.16s)]
*  and their infrastructure, much depleted [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  over the past couple of weeks. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=436.32000000000005s)]
*  But when I talk about infrastructure, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=438.48s)]
*  I'm talking about physical commanders and a chief, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  but the actual physical weaponry they have [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=444.76000000000005s)]
*  is vast at this point. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=448.8s)]
*  Malcolm, could you just give us a sense [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  of what the Israelis are up against here? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  Certainly estimates coming out of US think tanks [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=454.24s)]
*  and elsewhere suggest that Hezbollah have [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=457.76s)]
*  between 150,000 and 200,000 battlefield rockets, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  short-range missiles, mortars, drones. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=465.52s)]
*  The Israelis have destroyed some of those [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=469.56s)]
*  in the initial air strikes that have occurred [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=472.36s)]
*  since this operation against Hezbollah began. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=475.48s)]
*  Certainly the attacks against Hezbollah's command [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=478.64s)]
*  and control, its leadership, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=482.16s)]
*  including the attack on Nasrallah that killed Nasrallah [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  have been quite effective. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=486.8s)]
*  But the Hezbollah forces still do have [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=488.6s)]
*  substantial numbers of these weapons, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=492.44s)]
*  many of which are hidden in civilian areas inside homes. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=496.32000000000005s)]
*  And the challenge for the Israelis [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=500.32000000000005s)]
*  is to detect these weapons. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  And if Hezbollah start to prepare them for launch, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=503.96000000000004s)]
*  to be able to respond and strike quickly [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  against those threats. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=510.56s)]
*  Now there is obviously a risk if they're in civilian areas [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=512.68s)]
*  of Lebanese civilians being injured or killed. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think that the Israelis have little choice [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  but to continue to prosecute this war, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=521.6s)]
*  to continue to degrade Hezbollah's military capability, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=523.96s)]
*  including these battlefield missiles and rockets. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=527.88s)]
*  And for that reason, the air campaign has to continue. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=531.3199999999999s)]
*  The ground campaign, I think, is limited to creating, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=536.24s)]
*  as I said, this demilitarized zone [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=539.52s)]
*  that extends up to the Latani River. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=542.44s)]
*  Israel does not have a good history [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=548.4s)]
*  in successful invasions. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=550.84s)]
*  And Paula was alluding to that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=553.28s)]
*  in her reporting just earlier on. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=555.16s)]
*  I wonder what you believe is different this time. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=557.6s)]
*  In 82, ground forces went in. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=563.24s)]
*  They were promising a limited incursion [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=565.72s)]
*  as they are now promising the same this time. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=570.44s)]
*  It was three years before most of those Israeli troops withdrew. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=572.1600000000001s)]
*  Malcolm, what's different to your mind this time? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=576.44s)]
*  As many people say, there is no military option [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=579.9200000000001s)]
*  for success ultimately against Hezbollah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=584.72s)]
*  Look, I think that's right in the sense that, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=588.8800000000001s)]
*  supposedly you learn from operational experience. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=592.5200000000001s)]
*  So the Israelis would have learned from that earlier campaign, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=594.84s)]
*  but so would have Hezbollah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=598.4s)]
*  And so I think that there is the risk [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=600.36s)]
*  that history will repeat itself. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=602.0s)]
*  The Israelis will go in for yet another limited incursion [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=604.36s)]
*  on the ground, but they'll get bogged down [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=607.4399999999999s)]
*  because they'll have to defend that demilitarized zone [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=609.6s)]
*  that exists along the Latani River. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=612.52s)]
*  Obviously, the technology is different these days [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=614.84s)]
*  in terms of the ability for networked sensor systems [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  to be able to monitor Hezbollah movements [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=620.68s)]
*  across the other side of that river. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=624.0s)]
*  But there is the risk of Israeli forces getting bogged down, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  ending up in a similar situation to what happened then, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=630.28s)]
*  and essentially ending up in another quagmire [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=633.28s)]
*  where casualties are incurred on the Israeli side. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=636.56s)]
*  That then has a political consequence [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=640.76s)]
*  for Benjamin Netanyahu's government, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=642.48s)]
*  and it also encourages other forces, Hamas, the Houthis, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=645.04s)]
*  even Iran, to take advantage of Israeli's predicament. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bvBeFF71I&t=649.76s)]
