*  Why you guys doing a bonus for this and not Iran's massive strike on Israel from over the weekend? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=15.76s)]

*  This time with Israel hitting targets in Iran [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=33.06s)]
*  We're gonna talk about the insane logic of deterrence and escalation that you hear about constantly in DC [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=35.42s)]
*  It seems to be driving all of this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  We'll talk about what the White House knew about what's happening their response so far [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  We'll also touch on movement on efforts to deliver more military assistance to Israel and Ukraine by the way [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=46.06s)]
*  In the House of Representatives that might happen this weekend [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=52.059999999999995s)]
*  There's some more sanctions on Iran [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=55.22s)]
*  There's sanctions from the White House on right-wing extremist settlers in the West Bank [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  And we'll talk about what it all means for the Palestinians in the war in Gaza [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=60.5s)]
*  And then we'll take some questions from the pod save the world discord because you guys had some great ones as you always do [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=64.7s)]
*  Discorters always always [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=70.34s)]
*  Alright Ben, so should we just start with what happened last night? Why not? So here's what we know [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=72.34s)]
*  So Israel launched some kind of strike deep inside Iran on Thursday night, they hit targets in the city of Isfahan [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=77.7s)]
*  The Israelis reportedly targeted a military base there [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=84.86s)]
*  Iranian officials told the New York Times that the attack was carried out by small drones [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=88.06s)]
*  He's like quadcopter drones and they were launched from somewhere inside Iranian territory [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=92.86s)]
*  On Thursday night, you know, this was all very confusing because on Thursday night US officials were telling Western media that it was a missile strike [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=98.14s)]
*  Iran seems to be denying and downplaying what happened and saying no is these quadcopter drones [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=105.86s)]
*  But I did talk to someone in the US government who told me that the attack was more than just quadcopter drones [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=110.58s)]
*  Although this person would not elaborate so we'll probably find out in the coming days [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=116.3s)]
*  Isfahan is where Iran does a lot of missile production and research and development [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=120.78s)]
*  It's home to an Iranian airbase where they store f-14 Tomcats [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=124.5s)]
*  They bought from the United States back in the day Ben been before the Iranian Revolution in 1979 [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  There's four small nuclear research facilities in Isfahan [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=133.17999999999998s)]
*  Which were not targeted or hit according to Iranian state media [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  Iranian state media also said they shot down some additional small drones in another part of the country [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=141.17999999999998s)]
*  That's about 500 miles from Isfahan [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  So it was a very tense night because the president of Iran Ibrahim Raisi had recently said that quote [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  The tiniest act of aggression and quote on Iranian soil would draw a response [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=154.62s)]
*  The Iranian foreign minister I think was on CNN just hours before [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=158.78s)]
*  This Israeli attack happened saying quote the next response from us will be immediate and at maximum level so scary stuff [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=162.46s)]
*  So Ben, I think that's all that we know so far [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=169.9s)]
*  Please correct me if I missed anything or added anything and just generally what did you make of? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  Israel deciding to launch this strike deep into the Iranian territory [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=177.14s)]
*  well, the other thing that we don't know right is [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  Exactly [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  What if anything happened in other countries? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=186.14s)]
*  Because there was some reporting last night about potential strikes in Syria and Iraq, but we haven't got a lot of fidelity on that either [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  um [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=196.14s)]
*  But look I you know when I saw that there was an attack inside of Iran in Isfahan [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=197.1s)]
*  um, you know your first reaction is okay [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=203.18s)]
*  Well, that's you know a pretty significant action by Israel because in the same way that we haven't seen Iran launch direct attacks into Israel [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=205.5s)]
*  We haven't really seen Israel launch kind of standoff strike attacks inside of Iran. We've seen [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=214.46s)]
*  You know Israel do some other things, you know on a more [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=220.54s)]
*  unattributed basis inside of Iran over the years, but scientists yeah, or you know [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=223.56s)]
*  Cyber and things like that. They also did that pretty daring raid where they [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=229.66s)]
*  Raided like a warehouse full of old IRGC documents and included a lot of information about Iran's nuclear program before 2003 [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=233.42s)]
*  That's right. So they've done kind of you know, uh lower key things [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=240.54s)]
*  But then you know the more that information came out over the night. It was pretty clear that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=244.62s)]
*  This was not a very significant military action in other words [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=249.82s)]
*  Given that you know in the same way we talked about how Iran had [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=254.62s)]
*  Despite launching a barrage of things at Israel, you know Iran left some things in reserves, you know [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=257.74s)]
*  Say the his blow rockets in southern Lebanon [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=264.06s)]
*  Obviously Israel could have launched a much bigger strike inside of Iran [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=267.1s)]
*  And so it felt like they did the kind of minimal amount that they [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=271.82s)]
*  needed to do to feel like they hit a target inside of Iran without [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=276.54s)]
*  Trying to escalate this further. So in a strange way they were they were trying to answer the mail on [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=280.54s)]
*  You know, yes, we're willing to strike Iran even though the united states told us not to but we're going to do it in a relatively [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=287.58000000000004s)]
*  Minimalist way that is designed to avoid further escalation [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=295.9s)]
*  So it seems like we're still in this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  You know both sides trying to save face and indicate that they're willing to do something they haven't done before [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  But trying to calibrate it in a way that that manages escalation. So that seems to be like where we are [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=307.74s)]
*  You know, yeah, and so to add to that, I mean president reisi of iran [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=314.38s)]
*  Uh gave a speech on friday. He didn't actually reference the israeli strike at all [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=318.7s)]
*  He talked about what they had done over last weekend and about how it was a sign of the power of the islamic republic [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=321.98s)]
*  The iranian foreign minister said quote the zionist regime's media supporters in a desperate effort tried to make victory out of their defeat [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  While the downed mini drones have not caused any damage or casualties. So that's according to iranian state media [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=333.66s)]
*  So he's clearly trying to de-escalate as well [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=338.78000000000003s)]
*  In israel, you got the far right national security minister. Itamar ben gavir [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=341.18s)]
*  He posted a message on social media with one word saying lame [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=346.46000000000004s)]
*  So, uh extremist voices in israel are pushing for more too [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=350.7s)]
*  so ben, you know, we we talked about this a bit in the last episode, but we just wanted to again touch on how [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=354.62s)]
*  Stupid the logic of deterrence is so [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=359.98s)]
*  As I read the news this morning the same people who were saying that ira- israel had to respond to the iranian strikes to restore [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=363.18s)]
*  Restore deterrence now seem to be praising them for responding in a way that appears to have had absolutely zero military value [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=369.66s)]
*  So basically the strategy is [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=377.73999999999995s)]
*  Let's have iran and israel repeatedly fire drones and missiles at each other and hope that they miss that's that's the plan [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=379.82s)]
*  And every time I guess we're just one miscalculation [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=387.02s)]
*  One failed missile defense system away from some sort of massive war [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=390.06s)]
*  um, and you know, we also know for a fact that if iran's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=395.17999999999995s)]
*  Attack over the last weekend had killed a bunch of israelis [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=399.26s)]
*  The israeli response would have been massive because they're telling the media that we so basically [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=402.46s)]
*  Iran was reckless and lucky [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=407.34s)]
*  We also know that the israelis drastically miscalculated how iran would respond to the israeli military's strike in damascus in early april [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=409.65999999999997s)]
*  That killed a bunch of top iranian generals. The new york times reported that israel [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  Thought the iranian response would be quote fairly limited including small-scale attacks by proxies and a small-scale attack from iran [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=422.78s)]
*  Given the stakes involved. How do you think the logic here has gotten so broken? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=430.94s)]
*  That's a great question and you're right to note by the way the iranian response [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=436.3s)]
*  Was clearly to downplay this. I mean I sent you some things last night [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=441.82000000000005s)]
*  The irgc was putting out pictures of kind of tiny little drones could fit in your hand, you know [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  They're trolling each other, but they're trolling each other [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=450.06s)]
*  But I mean it's I it's a good thing. I guess that they're downplaying it because it suggests that you know, they're not looking to escalate and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=452.22s)]
*  So in a way, it's good that both sides are trying to act like they're moving on [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=459.98s)]
*  It seems like neither israel or iran wants to escalate this further in terms of direct exchanges of fire for now [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=463.74s)]
*  but in terms of your question, I don't the logic of deterrence it makes no sense here because [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=470.14s)]
*  uh, first of all both sides [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=476.38s)]
*  Don't look stronger for the actions they took so [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=479.66s)]
*  Iran doesn't look stronger for having fired a bunch of missiles and drones at israel and had them all shot down [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=483.02s)]
*  Um, and now I don't think and actually israel could have taken the win as you know, joe biden apparently told them to do [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=489.9s)]
*  But instead now i'm not sure they look super strong by [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=496.78s)]
*  Launching a kind of pretty minimal strike at isfahan [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=500.38s)]
*  um, so what deterrence has been [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=504.14s)]
*  Achieved or restored here? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=507.5s)]
*  And and and I think if we're honest about this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=509.41999999999996s)]
*  This feels a lot like some kind of a lot less like some kind of you know, uh [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=512.9399999999999s)]
*  Genius military strategy around deterrence and more about domestic politics in both countries and let's just name that and be honest about it [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=519.34s)]
*  It's like the iranians felt embarrassed that their embassy compound was hit in syria [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=527.02s)]
*  Felt like they need to do something [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=532.94s)]
*  There's some interesting reporting that's come out too tommy that suggested some of the iranian proxy groups were like hey [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=534.7s)]
*  Like we keep uh, you know, uh being in the crosshairs of israel. We keep launching attacks [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=540.62s)]
*  Where are you and maybe the iranians felt like they needed to kind of maintain some credibility with their own proxies to show that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=545.66s)]
*  Okay, we're willing to fire some things at israel, too. Whatever their logic was it felt like it was more about [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=552.38s)]
*  domestic political consumption [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=558.06s)]
*  Or regional consumption by their proxies than it was about some deterrence theory [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=560.38s)]
*  And then the same thing israel got out over its skis and announcing that they had to respond [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=565.3399999999999s)]
*  So they kind of boxed themselves in by saying that they were going to do something [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  and so therefore they chose to do something designed to not escalate things and so [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=575.34s)]
*  I guess the one thing that was achieved militarily by both sides is that they both [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=581.4200000000001s)]
*  Demonstrated that they're willing to take shots at each other, but I don't think it it created some deterrence dome [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  by doing it and and it to your point it just shows the kind of [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=594.0600000000001s)]
*  Irrationality of where we are [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=598.5200000000001s)]
*  in the middle east particularly and maybe even generally that [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=600.5400000000001s)]
*  You feel the need to risk [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=605.5s)]
*  starting world war three, you know [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=607.58s)]
*  To just what safe face so that some deterrence analysts can can can can can mouth talking points about restoring deterrence when [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=610.86s)]
*  This whole thing has just been a cycle of escalation [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=619.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=621.58s)]
*  And I reached out to someone very smart who I respect who said well [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=621.82s)]
*  He thought the goal of the strike was for israel to kind of show what they could do their capabilities to do these quadcopter [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=625.26s)]
*  Attacks in in the city where there's our you know, there's real military infrastructure, but israel has done [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=631.0200000000001s)]
*  Exactly these kinds of quadcopter drone attacks before in iran several times [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=636.5400000000001s)]
*  So i'm not sure I totally buy that but more broadly been [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=641.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean like again diplomacy is about putting yourself in the other guy's shoes and trying to see the world like they do [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  And people in washington are just incapable of doing that with iran like last episode [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  We played a clip of senator tom cotton saying imagine if the u.s [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=652.62s)]
*  Was israel and we had 300 drones and missiles fired at us like they did, you know [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=656.3000000000001s)]
*  Like they had to respond but you never hear tom cotton say [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=661.1800000000001s)]
*  Imagine if the chairman of the joint chiefs was assassinated while visiting a u.s embassy abroad because basically [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=664.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what happened to iran in syria [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=671.1800000000001s)]
*  Cotton never tries to put himself in iran's shoes because in his mind they're the bad guy [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=673.74s)]
*  And again for the thousandth time no one is saying iran is has good leaders or good actors [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=678.22s)]
*  They are not but you do have to try to understand their perspective and to your point about domestic politics [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=683.82s)]
*  They have extremists and they have moderates in their government like any other government, right? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=689.5s)]
*  They have politics they have to worry about external threats like any other country and let's be honest [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=692.94s)]
*  They're relatively weak in the region when compared to their neighbors [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=697.58s)]
*  Israel has nukes the saudis and the amirates have u.s weapons and bases that are a lot more modern [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=701.82s)]
*  Than the f-14 tomcats that they bought in, you know [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=708.3s)]
*  1975 or whatever when tom cruise was flying them around in the previous top gun [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=711.4s)]
*  So, you know, this is the frustration like iran supports these proxy groups in the region because that's their version of nato [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=717.1s)]
*  That's their security blanket right is these shitty little, you know proxy forces in iraq and syria and hezbollah and hamas [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=723.98s)]
*  Which that's not to say they're not lethal, but I mean that's sort of where they're coming from [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=731.1s)]
*  I just you know, you never hear anyone [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=735.02s)]
*  Think that way or try to understand where an ibrahim raesi might be coming from in terms of his political future [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=737.74s)]
*  Yeah, and there are a couple other points to this which is the real deterrence is different [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=744.78s)]
*  the deterrence in israel, I totally I mean [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=749.98s)]
*  not to impugn the the [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=753.5s)]
*  the person you spoke to but like [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=755.58s)]
*  Israel's deterrence iran knows what israel's capabilities are, you know, israel has significant [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=757.74s)]
*  standoff strike capabilities [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=763.48s)]
*  You know air capabilities israel has nuclear weapons, right? That's a lot of deterrence the reason that his bella [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=765.88s)]
*  Has not been fully activated in terms of firing thousands of rockets at iran is because if israel [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=773.32s)]
*  Used all of those capabilities. They could essentially kind of carpet bomb his bella and launch pretty significant strikes into iran [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=779.8000000000001s)]
*  That's deterrence not like a pinprick strike in isfahan, you know [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=787.4s)]
*  on the other side iran's deterrence is not [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=791.96s)]
*  necessarily [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=795.4s)]
*  You know its own capabilities inside of iran [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=796.68s)]
*  Its deterrence is actually more his bella. It's the fact that they have this significant force with thousands of rockets that could really rain down [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=799.56s)]
*  significant chaos on on israel in ways that are harder for missile defense technologies to deal with [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=807.62s)]
*  and so neither side has actually [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=812.5999999999999s)]
*  Utilized the thing that is their maximum deterrent in this situation [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=815.14s)]
*  It's more this kind of performative exchange and showing that we're willing to cross new lines [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=819.4799999999999s)]
*  You know, we're willing to push the envelope which to me feels more dangerous than it feels deterrent [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=824.12s)]
*  The other thing to be concerned about and this is what like a tom cotton [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=829.7199999999999s)]
*  is consistently failed to see to your point about domestic politics is [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=833.7199999999999s)]
*  Ultimately iran's bigger play to deterrence is to try to get a nuclear weapon [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=838.18s)]
*  This is why we had a nuclear deal that shipped out all of their [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=843.0s)]
*  Enriched uranium that had inspections. I know we've harped on this but the point is [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=847.24s)]
*  All the things that have happened I think make it more likely that iran is calculating right now [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=852.84s)]
*  We better whether on a covert or overt basis probably a covert basis [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=858.92s)]
*  You know, we better, you know double down on the idea that we need a nuclear deterrent [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=863.16s)]
*  Because if not iran can kind of israel can kind of do these kinds of things with impunity [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=867.16s)]
*  The last thing i'd say is we don't really know what happened yet [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=872.36s)]
*  There are these contradictory reports about missiles going into iran versus as you said drones inside the country [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=875.4s)]
*  You know, there's an intelligence cost and we'll never know the true answer to this [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=882.36s)]
*  But if israel utilized kind of intelligence networks that it has inside of iran to kind of launch something from within iran or [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=886.68s)]
*  Well, that's a burnt asset too, you know, that's something that that they you know, they probably can't turn back to that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=894.2s)]
*  So that's another piece of this. Yeah, the real deterrence is the friends we made along the way ben [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=900.84s)]
*  So, okay when israel hit that irgc target in damascus in early april killing the top irgc generals [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=905.9599999999999s)]
*  They reportedly gave the u.s. Almost no warning. It was kind of like real-time warning [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=912.92s)]
*  Uh this time with this latest response [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=916.8399999999999s)]
*  There's a bunch of reporting that says the u.s was told on thursday that israel planned to retaliate against iran in 20 to 48 hours [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=919.88s)]
*  So they had some sort of heads up [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=927.16s)]
*  the white house [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=928.92s)]
*  Uh has been today very conspicuous in terms of saying nothing [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=930.12s)]
*  Like I reached out to some folks who are like look at me responding to you by saying nothing [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=934.5200000000001s)]
*  Which I totally get right they're trying to like de-escalate kind of take the air out of this thing if they can [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=938.9200000000001s)]
*  But uh as a former press guy, you know [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=943.48s)]
*  What this will probably mostly do is get a bunch of reporters really mad as everyone else in the government leaks what happened? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=945.5600000000001s)]
*  But regardless ben, uh secretary of state tony blinking. He's in italy right now meeting with the g7 leaders to coordinate new sanctions on iran [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=950.76s)]
*  Uh, basically every leader in the g7 including president biden [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=958.0400000000001s)]
*  Asked netanyahu not to retaliate the biden line as you said earlier was take the win, but it seems like he refused to save face [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=961.88s)]
*  um ben [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=968.6800000000001s)]
*  How long does netanyahu get to tell every other western democracy to fuck off while supporting while expecting total support from them? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=970.44s)]
*  Uh, I mean literally a couple days ago the u.s and the uk were shooting down [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=978.2s)]
*  drones fired at israel then they asked him to take the win both rishi sunak and joe biden and he just [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=983.1600000000001s)]
*  Declined he said thanks. Thanks, but no, thanks. I'm good. I'm gonna do my own thing [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=990.0400000000001s)]
*  yeah, I mean it felt like he he tried to split the difference right because [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=994.36s)]
*  um on the one hand netanyahu [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=998.9200000000001s)]
*  Didn't take the win. He felt like he had to do something on the other hand [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1001.24s)]
*  What he did was kind of calibrated to you know, not have a massive escalation [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1004.2s)]
*  It's kind of like you used the schoolyard analogy last time tommy that like there's a big we're the big brother to israel [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1009.1600000000001s)]
*  And you know they kind of fight with us standing behind them. This is kind of like [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1015.56s)]
*  They were walking back towards our side of the schoolyard [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1019.9599999999999s)]
*  And we were like come come here come here and then they just kind of ran back and kicked around in the shins one more time [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1022.92s)]
*  And then you know like like but but to me like it it is just notable [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1027.0s)]
*  Sure, we had an influence I think uh in moderating this response [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1034.36s)]
*  And yet how many times can we read news cycles of the u.s? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1039.3999999999999s)]
*  Publicly saying don't do something and then nanyahu just does it. I mean there's still clearly this [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1043.5600000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's not normal, you know, and and at some point [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1049.8000000000002s)]
*  U.s. Policymakers are gonna have to absorb the reality that that nanyahu is not, you know [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1054.0400000000002s)]
*  Listening. Yeah, although I guess it's more normal than you think if you include like settlement construction [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1059.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean that's been going on for for a very long time. That's true. Yeah, so the the administration, uh, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1064.6000000000001s)]
*  The united states and the g7 I think have put forward a bunch of new sanctions on iran [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1069.8s)]
*  I don't know the specifics of them. I have zero confidence that they'll matter but it's happening [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1073.8s)]
*  Oh, that's going to be the thing that does it, you know, I mean there's something so performative and routinized about these sanctions announcements and [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1078.6s)]
*  uh, I there's no evidence that they work and and actually i'm going to say like [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1085.3999999999999s)]
*  There's a recent uh, just the last few days. I saw like a report out that iran has sold more oil [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1090.6s)]
*  To china in the last five years than ever before essentially [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1097.56s)]
*  um [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1103.08s)]
*  China is not participating in sanctions [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1104.1999999999998s)]
*  And the more we use sanctions and overuse sanctions the more other countries including china and india [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1106.6s)]
*  just start to ignore [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1113.96s)]
*  them because they're so overused and so [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1116.36s)]
*  Other than a political messaging strategy in washington to be able to say [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1120.12s)]
*  That's the way we put some new sanctions on iran. It has no impact in the real world that I can see [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  I do think tony blanket is about to go to beijing for meetings with his chinese counterpart. So [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1129.0s)]
*  Interesting that that's happening. Hopefully there's no fucking spy balloon incident that blows it up [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1134.12s)]
*  So ben, let's broaden this to gaza. Um over in the house of representatives speaker johnson [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1138.68s)]
*  Immediately put forward a resolution condemning iran for its strike on thursday 13 dems and one republican tom massey voted against it [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1142.98s)]
*  Johnson is also trying to pass [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1150.6s)]
*  Supplemental funding bills for israel and ukraine and a bunch of other priorities this weekend shockingly [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1152.6599999999999s)]
*  The house seems to be coming together in a bipartisan way to overcome objections from marjorie taylor green and a bunch of far-right morons [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1158.52s)]
*  So the israel aid bill is up to 26.38 billion dollars [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1165.96s)]
*  Some of that money will go towards paying for u.s military operations over the weekend last weekend [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1171.3999999999999s)]
*  To shoot down all those iranian drones and missiles that stuff costs a lot of money [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1176.36s)]
*  But according to the times of israel 5.2 billion goes towards israeli missile defense systems [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1180.04s)]
*  3.5 billion goes towards purchasing more advanced weapons systems [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1185.7s)]
*  And then there's 1 billion for weapons production more broadly and then a bunch of other stuff. It's not worth getting into so [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1189.8799999999999s)]
*  Key point is this is not just funding for missile defense systems or defensive only systems [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1196.28s)]
*  Switching gears to rafa the rafa invasion new york times reported that white house officials led by jake sullivan [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1204.04s)]
*  Had a virtual meeting with their israeli counterparts in israel over their rafa invasion plan [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1209.88s)]
*  Remember rafa is that city in in southern gaza where about a million people are are seeking shelter living in tents [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1215.3200000000002s)]
*  zero infrastructure [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1221.48s)]
*  The u.s side once again came away thinking that not enough planning was being done to protect civilians [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1223.48s)]
*  So we'll see how that plays out. Um, the cia director bill burns [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1229.24s)]
*  Publicly blamed tamas for rejecting the latest six-week ceasefire and hostage release proposal [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1233.64s)]
*  The very sad sticking point seems to be that hamas does not have 40 hostages in its control to release [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1239.16s)]
*  specifically women and civilians [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1246.82s)]
*  It's not clear if that means those hostages are being held by other militant groups [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1249.4s)]
*  Like palestinian islamic jihad or that just many of them have died, but very very grim [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1255.0s)]
*  Um, here's a clip of tony blinken talking about those ceasefire talks from earlier today [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1260.68s)]
*  the only thing [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1266.36s)]
*  The only thing standing between the gaza people and a ceasefire is hamas [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1267.96s)]
*  It's rejected [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1274.1200000000001s)]
*  Generous proposals from israel [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1275.72s)]
*  It seems more interested in a regional conflict [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1278.2s)]
*  Than it is in a ceasefire that would immediately improve the lives of the palestinian people [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1281.08s)]
*  It continues to move the goalposts [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1286.6000000000001s)]
*  And the world needs to know and needs to understand again [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1288.68s)]
*  That the only thing standing between a ceasefire [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1292.76s)]
*  Uh and uh, the gaza people is hamas [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1295.56s)]
*  Tony's really hammering the blame hamas messaging recently [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1298.92s)]
*  Um on friday the u.s announced more sanctions on far-right extremist settlers [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1301.96s)]
*  Which is a good thing including some close allies of itamar ben gavir [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1306.04s)]
*  And on thursday the u.s vetoed an effort at the united nations security council to recognize palestine as a full member state at the un [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1309.64s)]
*  So that's kind of the grab bag stuff ben of what's happening in washington and new york. Yeah, I mean a lot of different pieces this um [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1316.28s)]
*  On rafa, you know, you can sense the administration is [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1324.1200000000001s)]
*  Really alarmed as they should be about the potential humanitarian catastrophe if the rafa operation goes forward and frankly just the extent to which [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1328.1200000000001s)]
*  that would [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1336.3600000000001s)]
*  Extend this war, you know if they go into rafa, that's a potentially multiple multiple weeks months [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1337.96s)]
*  And and people have to start to realize that [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1344.3600000000001s)]
*  I think everyone kind of assumed at some point this will just get to a ceasefire and there'll be kind of return to normalcy [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1347.16s)]
*  And a lot of aid will get in [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1351.96s)]
*  There's a reality in which you know, we're talking in a couple months and it's much worse in terms of the humanitarian situation in gaza [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1353.64s)]
*  Tens of thousands of more people have been killed. It's still open-ended [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1360.5200000000002s)]
*  That's where like a maximalist rafa or perhaps even any kind of significant rafa operation could could land [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1364.6000000000001s)]
*  And you know, you saw the administration at the g7. They put out a statement, uh, uh together with the other g7 countries [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1371.72s)]
*  Reiterating their opposition to a full-scale military operation rafa and saying that it would have catastrophic consequences [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1378.52s)]
*  on the civilian population [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1385.0s)]
*  And so you can kind of sense the alarm now that brings me to the aid package [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1387.64s)]
*  it is [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1392.76s)]
*  I really worry about this package [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1394.6000000000001s)]
*  What message does it send to the world that we're simultaneously saying? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1397.8s)]
*  This will have a catastrophic consequence for the civilian population gaza that is already [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1402.44s)]
*  at the brink of famine [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1407.72s)]
*  And then we are shoveling out the door. What how what's the number 26 billion 26 billion dollars in military aid? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1409.4s)]
*  I would vote against this thing if I was in in the house [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1418.1200000000001s)]
*  You know unless you know, it was only defensive defensive weapons. Okay, well, we're going to restock the iron dome [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1422.2s)]
*  We're going to resupply air defense systems [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1427.8s)]
*  But there's offensive weapons in this package that are being used in gaza [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1430.3600000000001s)]
*  And and how can you simultaneously say [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1435.3999999999999s)]
*  That this raf operation shouldn't go forward be warning of you got sam power out there saying famine is here [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1439.24s)]
*  Like that's the usaia director [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1445.8799999999999s)]
*  saying that [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1447.8799999999999s)]
*  And then just give billions of dollars in offensive weapons [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1449.56s)]
*  Um, I I just think we haven't absorbed what message that sends the world and ben it gets worse [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1452.36s)]
*  It gets worse the wall street journal reported that separate and apart from those aid bills that the biden administration is considering sending more than a billion [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1457.72s)]
*  In weapons to israel. I imagine it's from like previous funding that [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1464.28s)]
*  Tronch includes 700 million dollars worth of tank ammo and 100 million dollars worth of mortar rounds [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1468.44s)]
*  Now i'm sure there's probably someone in the pentagon. That's like no no [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1475.08s)]
*  This is a long-term resupply that you know would be necessary to have in a stockpile in case there's a broader war [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1478.6s)]
*  With hesbullah or a broader war with iran, but like again that I don't know if that context is accurate [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1484.52s)]
*  But even if it is it doesn't matter the message it's sending not just to the world [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1490.84s)]
*  But also to people within the democratic party who desperately want a democratic president to end this war are just like [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1494.84s)]
*  Getting the finger left and right by these weapons transfer processes. That's right. And and [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1501.0s)]
*  And on the blame hamas part on the ceasefire. Absolutely. I mean if hamas is, you know [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1506.52s)]
*  Become intransigent and won't say yes to any ceasefire deal. That's terrible and that deserves to be called out [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1511.32s)]
*  however [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1518.36s)]
*  I don't see why the logic of that message is therefore that this roth operation has to go forward [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1519.96s)]
*  because [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1526.44s)]
*  number one [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1527.56s)]
*  The hostages aren't being rescued in the military operation, right? So they're dying in the military operation [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1528.92s)]
*  and [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1535.56s)]
*  And so if your logic is because hamas won't agree to a ceasefire [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1537.16s)]
*  It's somehow okay to have a famine in gaza [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1540.76s)]
*  It's somehow okay for this rafa like that's a dangerous logic [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1544.2800000000002s)]
*  There should be a ceasefire because there should be a ceasefire [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1549.24s)]
*  Because there's a famine in gaza because this military operation is not rescuing the hostages because this military operation [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1552.92s)]
*  has killed over 15 000 palestinian children, so [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1559.64s)]
*  Ideally, yes, there's a negotiated ceasefire that secures release of hostages, but we have to i'm [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1563.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm willing to stand behind the proposition that there should be a ceasefire in any case [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1570.1200000000001s)]
*  morally strategically [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1574.6s)]
*  For for all kinds of reasons including for israel because I just don't think going forward with this roth operation and killing another 10 000 palestinians [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1576.6s)]
*  Is gonna it's not going to destroy hamas. It's not going to cheat their military justice [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1584.76s)]
*  It's not going to secure the hostage's release. So I worry that the blame hamas message while totally necessary and right [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1588.2s)]
*  If that's what's happened in the ceasefire negotiation that it'll be used to suggest that therefore this kind of [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1595.24s)]
*  totally [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1602.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what to call this military operation anymore. Tommy like this [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1604.68s)]
*  It's not okay because you don't like hamas. Yeah, like it's catastrophic. It's like what are we doing here? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1609.48s)]
*  Yeah, look i'm with you hamas is a terrorist organization what they did on october 7th was evil and indefensible [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1616.04s)]
*  You cannot ever justify massacring civilians. I just I cannot ever think that's okay [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1622.0400000000002s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you're a freedom fighter or an israeli military, you know tanker [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1627.64s)]
*  Yeah, and just one other thing on this tommy if hamas is obstructing a ceasefire negotiation [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1631.8000000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's because they want this operation to go forward [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1636.2800000000002s)]
*  Maybe it's because they know that they're gaining support. Maybe it's because they know that israel is being isolated internationally [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1639.16s)]
*  These these terrorist organizations try to bait you into these actions is what al-qaeda wanted the united states to overreact [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1646.62s)]
*  To 9 11 like so stop and think use your heads [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1653.74s)]
*  Like the very fact that they are trying to be arsonist doesn't mean that you burn everything down [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1658.3s)]
*  Yeah, let's take some of these great discord questions because that'll also let us come back around to this u.n security council [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1663.1s)]
*  recognition question so deb w asks [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1668.84s)]
*  Iran has air defense systems like the iron dome or way less sophisticated [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1672.7s)]
*  To what extent do we have air defense systems that are not classified? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1677.5s)]
*  Are our cities protected by deterrence while irans are protected by active anti-ballistic missile systems? [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1681.5s)]
*  So deb rest assured [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1687.1s)]
*  We have lots of missile defense systems. We got interceptor sites in alaska. We have interceptor sites in california [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1689.74s)]
*  There are missile defense systems on navy ships [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1696.94s)]
*  There are forward deployed fad systems in guam south korea [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1700.3000000000002s)]
*  There's patriot missile batteries in all sorts of nato countries [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1704.7800000000002s)]
*  israel has [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1709.18s)]
*  Additive system additional systems like iron dome that are designed to intercept [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1711.1000000000001s)]
*  shorter range rocket fire [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1716.46s)]
*  Smaller projectiles we don't need those unless some real shit goes down in mexico and canada in which case [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1719.1000000000001s)]
*  You know we might have to rethink this one. I imagine then there's probably some like kind of iron dome like system [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1724.8600000000001s)]
*  Around the white house or something, you know, like really, you know strategic locations [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1729.9s)]
*  But we don't need blanket iron dome country coverage here in the united states. Thank god because of well oceans [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1733.9s)]
*  I know you're being pretty uh [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1739.98s)]
*  You kind of sleep at the switch on the canada [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1742.8600000000001s)]
*  Listen, I the one thing i'd say to kind of make deb freak out a little bit though [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1745.42s)]
*  Is that the the one exception to this is that there's never been? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1749.5s)]
*  A clear demonstration that when we're dealing with sophisticated [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1753.5800000000002s)]
*  Interna intercontinental ballistic missiles from say russia [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1757.66s)]
*  That we have assurance that we could shoot those down [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1761.68s)]
*  So this is the reagan it goes all the way back to star wars and but so we have the best missile defense systems in the world [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1764.16s)]
*  um [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1771.1200000000001s)]
*  But there there may be you know from our more sophisticated adversaries [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1771.92s)]
*  um, you know [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1776.3200000000002s)]
*  Capacity to evade them. We just we have not thankfully had to test that proposition but in training runs [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1778.3200000000002s)]
*  These things are not 100 percent, you know [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1784.16s)]
*  That's why nuclear war is not worth testing. That's not worth testing [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1786.72s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of the sort of modern nuclear missiles have something called a merv [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1789.8400000000001s)]
*  Which is basically they have separate payloads that can separate apart in separate reentry vehicles [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1794.72s)]
*  So one missile can hit a bunch of targets. So yeah to ben's point [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1800.96s)]
*  Uh, the more you learn about this stuff the less you ever want it to come to you know [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1804.16s)]
*  Test it let's just not just let's not mess around here spiffy asks [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1808.0s)]
*  When governments are considering their response to an attack like this do they tend to measure the proportionality against the damage done by the attack? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1812.0s)]
*  Or the scale of the damage it could have done [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1818.16s)]
*  Is there an active law for this obviously thinking about israel, but a u.s national security perspective would be interesting to hear too [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1820.96s)]
*  So great question spiffy. Um proportionality drives a lot of the rules and restrictions in the law of war [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1827.28s)]
*  So that is a key part of it [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1833.36s)]
*  But to your point earlier ben, I mean in this case [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  And frankly in iran's case, I think that politics was driving this is about saving face [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1838.32s)]
*  This is about showing tough. This is about appeasing the far right in in both countries. But what do you think? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1843.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. Uh to spiffy's like a specific question about law there there is a proportionality kind of doctrine in international law that [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1849.84s)]
*  Um that that allows for a certain kind of response [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1859.04s)]
*  Um that it's not disproportionate, but yeah, I agree with you tommy like if [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1862.6399999999999s)]
*  If like this was about politics iran felt [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1867.84s)]
*  angered embarrassed [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1872.46s)]
*  Exposed when their embassy got hit and their senior people got killed so they did something [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1874.48s)]
*  If they had killed a lot of people in israel [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1880.24s)]
*  If say some of those missile defense systems had failed, I think israel would have felt compelled to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1883.52s)]
*  Blow up more stuff and kill people in iran [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1888.96s)]
*  less because of the laws of war and more just because of like public attitudes and [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1891.92s)]
*  And again, that's you know [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1896.6399999999999s)]
*  nobody likes to act like politics comes into this in my experience politics is usually the [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1898.72s)]
*  number one factor in the decision making [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  By other countries and and in some cases by the u.s [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1907.84s)]
*  In terms of what you do. I think the question is how do the israeli people feel about this response? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1911.2s)]
*  Like our voices like it's mar ben gavir the ones kind of driving the narrative [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1917.12s)]
*  Um, because that's not good. Uh, or if they threaten to leave, you know, the netanyahu coalition [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1921.6799999999998s)]
*  If he doesn't know more that's frightening. I mean a lot of the coverage I saw this morning [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1926.8s)]
*  From sort of western correspondence, you know doing live shots at tel aviv or jerusalem was sort of like [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1931.12s)]
*  Look at how life is carrying on and no one sort of seems to care about this and everybody is unfazed. Hopefully that's [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1936.6399999999999s)]
*  a pervasive sentiment and and people are [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1943.1999999999998s)]
*  Uh not demanding their government do more to take out the iranian threat, but I don't know. I'm i'm i'm nervous about it [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1946.0s)]
*  Well, here's the problem too [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1952.72s)]
*  Is that I saw a poll that sounded like 52 percent of israelis did not think that there should be a strike on iran [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1954.0800000000002s)]
*  Which is good [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1960.4s)]
*  Except as in this country [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1962.0800000000002s)]
*  So this is not to single out israel the loudest voices are usually the most obnoxious in wanting a maximalist response, right? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1963.8400000000001s)]
*  and so we dealt with this constantly in the obama years where [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1970.64s)]
*  The media narrative was constantly dominated by people calling us weak, you know by lindsay graham by tom cotton by [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1974.24s)]
*  the kind of john bolton's of the world by the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1981.6s)]
*  Brett stevens's and and and and they weren't representative of public opinion [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1984.1599999999999s)]
*  But they could kind of drive they had a lot of political influence and they had a lot of uh megafone in the media [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1989.04s)]
*  And in israel right now [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1994.32s)]
*  Netanyahu's coalition depends upon the support of guys like ben gavir [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=1996.48s)]
*  And so even though ben gavir may not represent a majoritarian view [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2000.64s)]
*  You know, he kind of has to be listened to [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  And that's that's kind of the dangerous dynamic. Yeah, it is all very very frightening. Okay, great question spiffy [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2009.44s)]
*  Travis asks not that I want this but at what point do things escalate enough for biden to have no choice but to deploy troops [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2016.72s)]
*  Even if just in defensive operations, I got some bad news for you travis [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2023.44s)]
*  We got troops there. There's troops in the region. We got a base in barane. We got a big base in kutter [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2028.96s)]
*  There's us troops in kuwait the u.ie iraq [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2034.72s)]
*  Syria jordan remember that small base. We got a lot of troops on top of that [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2038.8s)]
*  Uh, there's additional aircraft carriers and naval assets constantly being sent to the region [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2044.32s)]
*  There's all these reports, uh, the u.s air force flying additional sort of over flights over, you know [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2050.0s)]
*  The middle east more broadly so there are tons of u.s military assets and people [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2055.76s)]
*  In the middle east that are in firing range of iran if they wanted if they decided that you know [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2061.84s)]
*  What like we're going all in and we're not just hitting the israelis [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2067.44s)]
*  But we're going to hit the americans because they're supporting the israelis. So the risk is already there [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2070.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and one of the reasons why you mentioned before that the israelis notified the u.s in advance [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2075.1200000000003s)]
*  That's a big reason why I mean part of it is to deconflict, right? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2080.7200000000003s)]
*  And so if we're doing something they don't want to you know us to see [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2084.48s)]
*  Something that looks unusual in the sky and shoot it down or something. But I think also [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2088.72s)]
*  The u.s probably takes what's called force protection measures, uh after an israeli strike on iran [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2094.8s)]
*  In other words, they may need to kind of alert their own air defense systems just in case iran decided to say [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2100.56s)]
*  You know what? You know, this crosses the line now. We're going to take a shot at u.s. Uh, uh personnel or facilities in the region. So [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2106.4s)]
*  Um, there's there's not only their troops there, but I think they're probably on relatively high alert [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2113.8399999999997s)]
*  um, and you know the challenge is one of the reasons that biden has tried to kind of [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2119.3599999999997s)]
*  De-escalate the circumstances he doesn't want them to get drawn in to a conflict, but but they're they're there [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2124.22s)]
*  Yeah, and one thing I think we all should be watching is um, remember when these iranian proxy groups [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2130.72s)]
*  Uh took a strike at that drone strike at the base in jordan and killed a couple two u.s service members [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2136.56s)]
*  Uh, the u.s responded pretty heavily, but also it seemed like the iranians, you know [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2142.0s)]
*  Called their buddies in these proxy groups and were like, please chill out like stop doing this. Don't go the americans into [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2147.28s)]
*  Uh getting more aggressive you have to wonder ben [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2153.36s)]
*  Will they maintain that posture like what will the proxy groups? I mean the houthi rebels in yemen [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2156.64s)]
*  Those guys yeah, they're firing off shit like a drunk guy on july 4th [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2162.88s)]
*  They're just firing missiles into the red sea all day every day [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2166.88s)]
*  But you know these proxy forces in in syria and iraq and then as you mentioned many times like the hezbollah is an arsenal [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2169.44s)]
*  If they all decide to be like, okay, we're gonna go after american bases now [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2175.6800000000003s)]
*  That would be very bad and that would create enormous pressure on president biden or the american, uh, say embassy in baghdad [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2179.44s)]
*  You know like in the past when there have been ratcheted tensions between the u.s and iran, you know, they [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2185.6800000000003s)]
*  To those old enough to remember there's still a green zone. There's still a kind of security perimeter around [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2192.0s)]
*  Where the u.s embassy is and and that could be vulnerable too. So it's not just troops in some cases [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2197.04s)]
*  What's more vulnerable at times is these u.s diplomatic facilities because they're not as hardened [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2202.8s)]
*  As say a bases and so that that enters into the equation too. Yeah, that was something. Uh, we all learned the hard way [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2207.52s)]
*  During the arab spring and after the banghazi attacks [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2214.88s)]
*  There's a lot of a lot of americans serving in dangerous places for deployed and it's [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2218.1600000000003s)]
*  Very hard to have eyes on all of them at all times [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2222.96s)]
*  Then uh, why salami one asks why would the u.s veto the resolution for palestinian un membership? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2225.68s)]
*  It seems to be in complete opposite to recent calls from the u.s for a two state solution [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2232.16s)]
*  Great question great observation. You want to start with this one? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2238.08s)]
*  Yeah before I do though not to undermine the seriousness of the question. Is it is it why salami? It's why the letter capital s [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2241.84s)]
*  Alami the number one. I see so it's not like someone questioning whether you would eat. Oh, no [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2249.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, good good [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2256.0s)]
*  Wither salami. No, I just want to get this clear because I I like salami so I could have answered that question. I'm with you [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2257.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, so this is a perennial question [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2263.68s)]
*  In the obama years for instance [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2267.3599999999997s)]
*  We were quite outspoken against settlement construction [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2270.96s)]
*  And multiple times I remember pretty clever countries at the un [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2274.08s)]
*  taking direct language from barack obama's statements and making them un resolutions and then [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2278.72s)]
*  Forcing us, you know to make a choice and we [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2284.0s)]
*  over my objections [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2287.36s)]
*  Vetoed those resolutions. We finally let we finally abstained at the end of the obama administration and had one of those resolutions go forward [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2289.52s)]
*  I think that this is an important question because there's this kind of knee-jerk [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2297.2799999999997s)]
*  view in washington that we can't [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2301.7599999999998s)]
*  Um [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2304.5600000000004s)]
*  Pursue any recognition of a palestinian state at the un [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2305.6800000000003s)]
*  In the the constant refrain you'll hear i'm sure it'll be in the talking points [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2309.36s)]
*  I'm sure it's in the talking points that they use to justify this veto [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2312.7200000000003s)]
*  We believe that any resolution should be negotiated between the parties [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2316.96s)]
*  It's clearly not happening [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2321.0400000000004s)]
*  There is no negotiation happening between the parties [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2323.5200000000004s)]
*  The israeli government as currently constituted is outwardly against the establishment of palestinian state [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2326.5600000000004s)]
*  And so I believe that recognition of a palestinian state in international forums like the un [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2332.88s)]
*  Should be on the table for the united states. There should not be [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2338.64s)]
*  a de facto veto [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2341.84s)]
*  and at a minimum [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2343.84s)]
*  Why it's not unlike what we've been saying about uh military assistance [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2346.48s)]
*  Why would you give away all of your leverage israel clearly doesn't want the united states to pursue any recognition? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2351.2000000000003s)]
*  It could be through a general assembly resolution [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2356.08s)]
*  That is less kind of binding or could be through a security council resolution like this [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2359.04s)]
*  but if the u.s. Indicated that it was open to [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2363.12s)]
*  You know some form of international recognition of a palestinian state [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2366.4s)]
*  Unless israel, you know did x and y [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2370.96s)]
*  I think israel will be far more likely to do x and y in terms of so [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2373.92s)]
*  Like this is one of those things where like it's somehow ingrained in u.s. Policy [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2378.56s)]
*  To remove any of our leverage [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2382.96s)]
*  And I think that doesn't make any sense if you believe there should be a palestinian state [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2385.36s)]
*  You should be willing to stand behind that position international for like the un [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2389.28s)]
*  and if you [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2393.52s)]
*  Believe that you want it to be negotiated. You should at a minimum [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2395.04s)]
*  Use that as leverage to try to get israel into a real negotiation. Look it is it's at best an incoherent [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2398.8s)]
*  Uh us at best and that's not a criticism of president biden. That's a criticism of us and everybody else too everybody [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2405.12s)]
*  I thought this was illogical when we were in government tommy like to take their argument a good faith it is [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2411.04s)]
*  quite clear that the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2417.84s)]
*  Biden administration thinks that the best path to achieving a two-state solution to creation of a palestinian state will come through this [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2420.32s)]
*  Process of trying to get the saudi government and the israelis to normalize relations [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2428.46s)]
*  I think the idea is that [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2433.04s)]
*  In cutting this deal where the u.s [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2435.12s)]
*  Would basically have to give the sati some sort of security guarantee kind of a nato like article 5 like guarantee [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2437.2s)]
*  It sounds like maybe even a civilian nuclear infrastructure imagine muhammad bin salman with nuclear infrastructure [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2442.4s)]
*  If that sounds like a good idea to you, I we we disagree [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2449.2s)]
*  Some sort of weapons shipments probably and the israelis they would have to give [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2452.7999999999997s)]
*  Some sort of meaningful steps towards the creation of the palestinian state now [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2457.92s)]
*  I'm much less hopeful than biden's team is [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2461.6s)]
*  That that could happen or that netanyahu like has the flexibility [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2464.56s)]
*  To take whatever steps would be required to get this normalization deal done, but that seemed to be what they think is the best path [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2468.64s)]
*  And then talks between the two parties israelis and the palestinians [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2475.2799999999997s)]
*  I agree with you been that the normalization at the u.n should be on the table [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2479.12s)]
*  The question i've always had though is kind of okay. Let's say either the united nations general assembly or the u.n security council [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2482.72s)]
*  Uh gives the palestinian state recognizes the palestinian state [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2490.08s)]
*  Then what right it's not like something like you snap a finger and it magically creates a palestinian state with a government and infrastructure and territory [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2495.44s)]
*  Like there would then have to be a process of what? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2502.64s)]
*  expelling [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2505.98s)]
*  uh all israelis from certain parts [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2507.04s)]
*  Uh of the west bank or jerusalem like right so like it's for people who think this is a clean option [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2509.92s)]
*  It is it is far from that it's not and and and you're right to flag that and and [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2515.92s)]
*  but look the reality is these resolutions do matter the reason that [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2521.52s)]
*  The west bank and gaza are treated as uh and viewed as occupied territories is because of you know [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2525.6800000000003s)]
*  Existing u.n resolutions right it creates a basis [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2531.6000000000004s)]
*  International law creates a home base a place to come back to [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2534.6400000000003s)]
*  Now to your point like it's not like the u.s would just like wake up yesterday and decide you know what we're gonna like [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2537.84s)]
*  Now all of a sudden support this resolution that is legally binding [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2544.2400000000002s)]
*  on the creation of palestinian state [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2548.2400000000002s)]
*  the question is is [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2550.2400000000002s)]
*  Twofold in my mind one is again. Why not introduce this into the process? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2552.32s)]
*  let's just take the obama years like if when john carrey was trying to [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2556.88s)]
*  Negotiate a two-state solution and bb. Netanyahu is clearly you know in my view never that serious about that [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2561.28s)]
*  Why didn't we give john carrey the leverage to say you know what? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2568.32s)]
*  We're open to recognizing [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2572.0s)]
*  You know a u.n resolution that has recognition of palestinian state and takes positions on final status issues like [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2574.32s)]
*  borders of an israeli and palestinian state [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2580.32s)]
*  All of a sudden that's a lot more leverage for the u.s. You know mediator in that negotiation [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2583.1200000000003s)]
*  That's so the first point is again like bring this into the conversation around saudi normalization like try to design a whole package [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2588.6400000000003s)]
*  That has as a part of it some kind of u.n recognition [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2596.48s)]
*  By the way that also allows you to to shape the u.n resolution so that it takes into account [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2600.26s)]
*  some of israel's concerns [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2606.1800000000003s)]
*  and then the second thing is [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2608.34s)]
*  This would have this seemed very dramatic because we did debate this option in the obama years and it seemed incredibly dramatic to [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2609.94s)]
*  To shift positions on u.n recognition [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2616.6600000000003s)]
*  however, that's because we were closer in time [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2619.46s)]
*  to [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2622.5s)]
*  Peace efforts that almost got there, you know camp david in 2000 [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2623.78s)]
*  Annapolis in 2006 we had a couple rounds as this israeli government [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2627.54s)]
*  drifts further and further and further away [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2632.9s)]
*  from a negotiated settlement and as [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2635.46s)]
*  Israeli settlement construction just eats away at what might be a palestinian state. I think things like this at once seemed [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2638.0s)]
*  Like you know far out options have to kind of become more and more normalized as wait a second [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2645.14s)]
*  Unless we're willing to abandon a two-state solution forever [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2651.06s)]
*  This has to be on the table is kind of one way to short circuit the process and get [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2654.1800000000003s)]
*  Some oxygen back into the concept of palestinian state otherwise, by the way [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2658.5s)]
*  What are we doing? We're looking at we're looking at a one-state solution, you know, and and [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2663.2200000000003s)]
*  And everybody says that they don't want that because because that either [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2667.5400000000004s)]
*  Has the demographics of israel being potentially majority palestinian [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2671.86s)]
*  With you know second-class citizenship or kind of mass expulsions of palestinians. There's not another way here. There's not a better path [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2676.1000000000004s)]
*  Real quick. I was looking at harats. Apparently abc news is reporting that israeli aircraft fired three missiles at iranian air defense radars [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2683.46s)]
*  near one of their nuclear facilities [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2692.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh near natanz near the natanz nuclear facility, which is their main facility [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2694.34s)]
*  So I don't obviously we can't verify that report, but maybe that's why [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2698.9s)]
*  This u.s. Government person was saying to me. No, it wasn't just these quadcopter drones. There was there were more elements of this strike. So [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2702.26s)]
*  Worth noting but also good that despite that reality it sounds like the iranians are downplaying it [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2710.1s)]
*  Before we go, we should just give [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2715.54s)]
*  President biden some credit. They did put forward more sanctions on these prominent far-right [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2717.54s)]
*  israeli settler extremists [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2724.08s)]
*  This is based on you know, executive order that president biden put together. He seems to be slowly ratcheting up the pressure [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2727.06s)]
*  Um, i'm with you ben that you know, I would love for that pressure to get to senior israeli elected officials like itamar ben gavir [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2733.46s)]
*  Or smotrich who are really the problem here, but it seems like they are sanctioning people closer and closer to the top. So that's [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2742.02s)]
*  Good. Yeah to give them credit on a few. I mean, I I think biden [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2748.7400000000002s)]
*  Had an influence on this strike, you know, like we said earlier like I think it was more minimalist and it probably started [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2752.9s)]
*  I think that this [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2760.58s)]
*  This is an innovative new tool of the u.s at going after kind of extremist settlers. I agree with you [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2762.1s)]
*  The leadership, I mean smotrich is literally the leader of the west bank settlers and he's in the government, right? So [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2767.46s)]
*  You know ultimately I think it he needs to be a part of this. Um [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2773.22s)]
*  But again, you see them turning the dial. The question is [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2777.2999999999997s)]
*  like raf is the key point this is what people should be watching is [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2780.3399999999997s)]
*  Well two things does is aid getting in? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2784.8199999999997s)]
*  Um, and it seems like it's kind of not really getting in like it should but whether if rafa goes forward [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2786.98s)]
*  There's a real question on the table for uh, I mean, I just don't know how you can continue [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2793.7000000000003s)]
*  In the status quo in that scenario, but but but again [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2798.5800000000004s)]
*  You know saying you're against it and giving 24 billion dollars in assistance. It's a bit a bit challenging tough messaging square to circle [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2802.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, uh, that's the main issue is will our actions be aligned with our words? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2809.38s)]
*  Yeah, always the always a challenge in this issue, uh, okay. Well, that's it for us today unless you know ben [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2813.86s)]

*  Didn't know if you want to do a 30 second review for the people or we just you know, we're not ready yet [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2823.46s)]

*  Uh eastern time so that's one of the good things about being west coast when you get a midnight album drop [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2831.62s)]
*  I could I could scout the album out for my daughter [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2836.82s)]
*  Uh, there's some f bombs in there [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2840.98s)]
*  I made that's fine. Uh taylor can get away with that. She hears them on this show [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2844.1000000000004s)]

*  This is like closer to the dad rock of folklore [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2854.82s)]
*  The national is deeply involved. Uh [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2858.02s)]
*  the the writing I just gotta say like taylor swift is [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2860.5s)]
*  is is [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2864.6600000000003s)]

*  She's she's uh, she's a good writer. I I have to say, uh, so people should check it out. It's good [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2874.02s)]
*  Yeah, the diss tracks are coming. It's uh, it's very uh drake. Uh jay cole, etc, etc [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2879.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay, that's it for us for this week. Uh, pray to god. There's no other bonuses this weekend [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2884.5s)]
*  Because let's not have bonuses done with this bonus nonsense [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2889.14s)]
*  Last thing we should say tommy is a good thing if the ukraine aid gets out there because [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2892.1800000000003s)]

*  So and it's like the stat you always read is if the russians have a 10 to 1 fires advantage meaning they're firing [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2902.26s)]
*  10 mortar shells for every one that comes back to them [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2908.5800000000004s)]
*  They will be able to take all this territory back and it will be um, very very bad [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2911.0600000000004s)]
*  So keep an eye on that. I'm sure we'll talk about that for the show coming next wednesday [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9pgY0U51qU&t=2915.3s)]
