Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes tackle the big question: will Trump be stupid enough to drag the United States into another war in the Middle East? They dig into the various right-wing forces arguing for and against US involvement, discuss why following Benjamin Netanyahu into yet another regime change war in the region is insane, and how this conflict has ballooned from strikes on nuclear infrastructure to a full-on push for regime change. They also talk about the DC blob and media’s cheerleading for these disastrous wars, the eerie similarities between the current moment and the runup to the war in Iraq, and Trump’s willful disregard of our own intelligence. Finally, they cover the efforts in Congress to try to prevent the US from wading into the conflict and why Democrats need to stand firmly against it. Then, Tommy is joined by Congressman Greg Landsman. Landsman supports the US joining the fight against Iran and has been a vocal defender of the war in Gaza, so they debate each policy. Landsman also discusses the terrifying news that he was on the so-called “hit list” found in the Minnesota shooter’s car.

# Will Trump Drag the U.S. Into Israel’s War with Iran?
**Pod Save the World:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, how's New York doing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=0.0s)]
*  We got a little politics here, Tommy. A little lively mayor's race going on. Yeah. Yeah. What is that? Is that today? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  It's early voting already. So for people who haven't been following this, this couldn't be like more of a stark choice. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=11.0s)]
*  You've got like, you know, Andrew Cuomo [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=16.64s)]
*  representing the kind of restoration of like hard-ass centrist politics and some other things obviously. And then Zeran Mamdani, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  you know, 33 year old on the other direction. It's never dull in New York. Actually, Brad Lander got arrested today. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=27.28s)]
*  Yeah, that was crazy. Another candidate. So yeah, early voting numbers are way, way up. And [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=32.84s)]
*  for some reason, Mamdani is treated like he is becoming ambassador of the UN. It only gets questions about when he's gonna visit. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=37.88s)]
*  Mamdani, yeah, like it's actually I've been trying to, you know, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=44.32s)]
*  I'm always being Yorker and like I want to know about his like plans to like make bus free and you know, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  keep the rents down and but all people want to ask about Israel. It's weird. That's crazy. Well, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=53.8s)]
*  we're gonna meet a similar boat today, Ben. We're gonna focus basically the whole show today on the war between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=60.28s)]
*  So we're gonna update you guys on what happened since Friday when we recorded that bonus episode. How this war is quickly ballooned from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=66.24s)]
*  being about weapons of mass destruction to regime change. Sounds familiar. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=74.36s)]
*  We'll talk about the voices pushing Trump to get involved in bombing Iran directly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=78.24s)]
*  and we'll talk about some of the voices urging caution and the media coverage around all of it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=83.12s)]
*  We're also going to talk about some political considerations for Democrats [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  and then why we think no one should trust Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu when it comes to intelligence about [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=90.04s)]
*  WMDs or regime change wars generally. Then you're gonna hear my conversation with Congressman Greg Landsman from Ohio. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  So Greg is somebody I've known for a few years now. I consider him a friend. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=105.12s)]
*  We profoundly disagree both about the war in Gaza and also about this new war in Iran and we argue about it all the time on [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=109.4s)]
*  text until we figured why not take that to the podcast? So let us know what you think. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=118.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that Tommy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=123.08s)]
*  I mean we you know, we occasionally air all views here on Podsay the World. Doing our best. Doing our best to air all the views. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=125.04s)]
*  Alright Ben, let's just jump right into it. So last Friday [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=131.44s)]
*  we did an episode about this surprise Israeli attack on Iran. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=134.28s)]
*  If you want more of the backstory into how that all went down listen to that episode [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  but this is going to be more of an update for on what things have happened since that time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=141.12s)]
*  So as of Sunday the IDF confirmed that they had hit over [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  170 Iranian targets in more than 720 military infrastructure components. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  Bloomberg reported that Iran has launched around [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=153.88s)]
*  370 ballistic missiles towards Israel with around 30 hitting targets. As of this recording [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=156.84s)]
*  Iran has taken about 224 casualties in Israel. 24 casualties. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=162.24s)]
*  So some real damage happening so far. Much of Israel's nuclear infrastructure [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=167.84s)]
*  has taken a beating like the Natanz enrichment site, the Isfahan site. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  There's lots of missile and military infrastructure that's gotten hit and Israel has killed a number of additional Iranian military and intelligence leaders. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=176.72s)]
*  Trump and Israeli officials now say they have taken out all of Iran's air defense systems and they can fly over the country at will. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=184.84s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reported the US intelligence thinks Israel has set Iran's nuclear work back by about five to six months. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=191.72s)]
*  And while you know US and Israeli missile defense systems have intercepted the majority of Iran's missiles [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=198.56s)]
*  dozens have gotten through and they've hit in major population centers like Tel Aviv. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=203.96s)]
*  And so Ben as of 2 p.m. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=207.84s)]
*  Tuesday Pacific time when we're recording this this is not just an active war [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=210.32s)]
*  but one that is growing and one that is clearly now a regime change operation not just a limited strike on nuclear infrastructure. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  We know this because there are all these reports that Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill the supreme leader of Iran's. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=220.88000000000002s)]
*  You don't get more regime change either than that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=226.8s)]
*  And a big question now is whether the United States is going to get directly involved in offensive military operations. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=228.84s)]
*  Meaning are we going to bomb Iran ourselves? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=235.88000000000002s)]
*  So on Monday night Trump left the G7 meetings in Canada early to head back to Washington for meetings about Iran. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=239.08s)]
*  Earlier today Axios reported that quote Trump is seriously considering joining the war and launching a US strike against Iran's nuclear facilities [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=245.48s)]
*  especially its underground enrichment facility in Fordow. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=252.84s)]
*  That is the facility we talked about on Friday that's buried deep into the side of a mountain. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=255.6s)]
*  When military experts think can only be destroyed by a series of bombing raids with America's massive [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=259.56s)]
*  30,000 pound bunker buster bombs which can only be carried by US bombers. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=265.76s)]
*  Israeli officials tell Axios they believe Trump is going to join the fight. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=271.44s)]
*  We'll see. That could be a wish casting. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=274.56s)]
*  But if Trump does get more involved it will likely because of the inexorable push towards war that presidents the United States feel because of voices like this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  Diplomacy is not successful and we live with the option of force. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=287.76s)]
*  I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=293.0s)]
*  Well as President Trump said on Friday morning that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  And he scheduled talks on day 63. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=308.76000000000005s)]
*  You know that. I mean this was a this wasn't really a hard deadline. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=311.32000000000005s)]
*  He gave them 60 days on day 61 the strikes began. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  You know sometimes when you see evil it's actually evil. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Wouldn't Israel be doing the United States and the West a favor by taking them out. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=322.36s)]
*  And if we had a ally country that's trying to destroy the regime. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=328.35999999999996s)]
*  Or at least their nuclear weapons. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=333.96s)]
*  I think we'd be appreciative of that don't you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  I think so. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=340.12s)]
*  So that was Senator Lindsey Graham Senator Tom Cotton and then radio host Fox News personality Mark Levin. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=341.35999999999996s)]
*  Boy Tucker Carlson is right. He is a horrible voice. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=347.35999999999996s)]
*  So Ben we're going to dig into lots of different pieces of all of this. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=350.2s)]
*  But I just want to start by asking you about any of the kind of big picture takeaways from you since we talked on Friday and then kind of where you are and whether you think Trump is going to get us directly involved in this war offensively or not. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=354.12s)]
*  Yeah a couple big picture things. I mean first I think it's really important to say that there's no reason that this war had to happen now. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=366.48s)]
*  I'm struck Tommy that since Israel launched what it called a preemptive strike they didn't even go through the exercise of putting out cooked up intelligence suggesting that the Iranians were just about to weaponize a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=375.16s)]
*  Iran has had for people who don't follow this closely Iran has had a nuclear program for decades. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=391.48s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu has been warning about them being on the precipice of having a nuclear weapon for as long as I can remember. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=397.08000000000004s)]
*  And nothing changed between the day before this strike happened the day after. So there was no reason for this to happen now. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=404.04s)]
*  Israel was not any less secure you know the day that they took the strike than they were the last 10 years. Right. So this is entirely a war of choice launched by Israel. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=411.8s)]
*  Ostensibly it's a nuclear program. Second thing is this is very much feeling like a regime change operation and we have to emphasize that too. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=423.28s)]
*  Because if they were just hitting nuclear facilities just even hitting nuclear and ballistic missile facilities you know that would be one thing I still wouldn't think that was a good idea. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=432.35999999999996s)]
*  And you know frankly that would only at this point have set the Iranian nuclear program back a few months. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  They're not hitting just those targets. They hit the television station. What does the television station have to do with the nuclear program. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=447.44000000000005s)]
*  They are just killing generals and scientists including generals that are not involved in the nuclear program. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=456.36s)]
*  What does that have to do with setting back the nuclear program. They were they were hitting oil facilities. Right. So this feels very much like Israel has like a target list that includes people [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  and infrastructure and you know aspects of the regime including media and they're just hitting it all. And the fact that they want to kill the supreme leader. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=474.12s)]
*  I mean we are in a new world here. I mean whatever you think of the supreme leader and no no not a fan of his. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=484.32s)]
*  We were now just in the place where we assassinate the leaders of other governments we just decapitate regimes and preemptive wars. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=493.52s)]
*  That is a wholly new place to be here. It seems like Israel is getting treating the Iranian regime like it's Hezbollah. Right. Like they're just going through it like it's a series of personality based assassinations. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=502.16s)]
*  But the problem is this regime runs a very large and important state. Right. With with huge resources with tens of millions of people. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=517.04s)]
*  And so this what you've not heard from Israel is any description of where this ends where this goes. I mean the things that are the most eerie to me because there's a lot of echoes of the Iraq war here Tommy and we're going to unpack some of those. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=527.04s)]
*  But you see some people you know I said Newt Gingrich or tweeting something like oh my god now is the time for there to be like a secular moderate inclusive government. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=541.4s)]
*  Like that. Where is that government going to come from. Right. So to me it's very alarming. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  We're a week into this thing and it's just on a rapid escalatory cycle. And it feels to me like Donald Trump is getting pulled into this thing. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=556.52s)]
*  That you know the comment he couldn't stand up to be BNN now he's afraid to do that he was too weak to stand up to be BNN now his own diplomacy got derailed that's bullshit. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=564.24s)]
*  That we gave diplomacy a chance we didn't the Iranians are trying to make a deal. Then Israel killed the guy who was trying to negotiate the deal. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=573.5200000000001s)]
*  And he's afraid he's more afraid of you know Fox News and Lindsey Graham and BNN now then he is of his own base who he promised that he wouldn't do this. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=580.2800000000001s)]
*  And it's a scary place for us to be. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=593.0s)]
*  Yeah. So the Wall Street Journal just had a piece that posted a couple hours ago about kind of where the U.S. and Israel differ on the intelligence case. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  And it said before launching its attack on Iran last week Israel provided the U.S. with intelligence it deemed alarming. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=604.5999999999999s)]
*  Tehran was conducting renewed research useful for a nuclear weapon including an explosive triggering system. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=610.0s)]
*  But U.S. officials briefed by the Israelis weren't convinced that the information pointed to a decision by Tehran to build a bomb. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=615.48s)]
*  It sounded like they were doing research. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=622.4s)]
*  The Times New York Times had sort of similar reporting like the U.S. is not aware of new intelligence showing Iran is rushing to get a bomb. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=624.64s)]
*  And I think that's very important because one I mean obviously it's the entire pretext for the war. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=633.6s)]
*  But to Netanyahu was on Fox News over the weekend and on countless news channels just lying in saying that that they Israel had to act now because Iran was rushing to get a bomb when you know the U.S. intelligence timeline is still like yeah it'll take one to two weeks to produce enough weapons grade uranium for a nuke. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=637.64s)]
*  And then you but then you would have to go through the weaponization process. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=659.44s)]
*  It could take much much longer to get it on a warhead and then to get it on a missile that could hit targets. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=663.52s)]
*  So we're talking about a process that would take you know like six months to up to three years according to like whichever intelligence assessment you believe. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=668.16s)]
*  But Netanyahu is just kind of like yada yada yada in those details and claiming there was some sort of imminent threat he had to neutralize. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=677.24s)]
*  The Times also reported then that U.S. intelligence like late last month figured out that Israel was planning an imminent attack with or without us. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=685.08s)]
*  And they say Trump warned Netanyahu not to do anything and not to screw up his diplomatic efforts. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=695.52s)]
*  But basically like BB just didn't care and Trump was too weak to make him listen. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=700.4399999999999s)]
*  So like all of that bullshit we were talking about last week about how you know there was this elaborate ruse between the U.S. and the Israelis where they were just it was like designed to fool the Iranians. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=705.04s)]
*  That was total bullshit like the Times reported that Mr. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=716.96s)]
*  Trump was still stressing the importance of giving diplomacy a chance and while doing so was not intended to deceive the Iranians about the immediacy of a potential attack. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=720.92s)]
*  But the possibility that it might deceive them was like a welcome side effect. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=728.68s)]
*  So in other words Trump sincerely wanted diplomacy. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  The fact that he kept talking about it certainly does seem to have convinced some of these Iranian generals and scientists and people that they were safe sleeping at their homes rather than going to a bunker. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=735.3199999999999s)]
*  But this was not 5D chess as we expected. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=745.92s)]
*  Yeah. And just to put a point on the intelligence because it really is important. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=749.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean it's amazing to me that we know nobody even feels compelled to have to make this case anymore. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=752.92s)]
*  You need to go through several steps to acquire a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=759.08s)]
*  You need to acquire enough nuclear fuel and that requires its own breakout. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=763.44s)]
*  You know that you're you're rushing to enrich uranium at a high percentile so that you can have enough fuel for a bomb. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=767.32s)]
*  You need to know how to weaponize that nuclear material which we you know we don't know that the Iranians I mean in the past the assessment has been that they didn't have the capacity to weaponize. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=774.28s)]
*  But then you have as you said go through this process which takes months to miniaturize the fuel put it on a warhead all this stuff right. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=786.3199999999999s)]
*  The reason that's important is that Israel had plenty of time plenty of decision space to do this and instead they did it to derail Donald Trump's diplomacy. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=793.64s)]
*  And like every now and then we give ourselves this allowance like imagine if a Democratic president got humiliated like that. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=803.52s)]
*  Well I guess Joe Biden did so we can imagine it because it just happened. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=810.52s)]
*  You know Bibi Netanyahu did to Trump an even worse version of what he did to Biden because with Biden it was just like I'm just going to ignore what you say about Gaza and take all your weapons and bomb people there. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=814.24s)]
*  But here he wants the U.S. to come in the war that he started over the objections of Donald Trump. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=826.76s)]
*  And Donald Trump it feels like he's getting pushed that way that that story was amazing because basically the reporting was that Donald Trump thought that the war looked good on Fox News. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=833.16s)]
*  And that he was watching Fox News and you know why because Fox News doesn't tell you the full story. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=842.6s)]
*  Fox News gives you this completely airbrushed version where Israel looks like they're in the most ingenious military operation ever and Donald Trump's like well I want to be a part of that you know. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=848.2800000000001s)]
*  And this is a crazy crazy way to make decisions about war and peace. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=856.36s)]
*  The American people where are they in this. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=861.2800000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump has not really spoken at length to us about you know we usually would expect presidents to give speeches about what would be our objectives here. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=863.24s)]
*  You know what would be the legal basis for launching this military strike. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=871.2s)]
*  What's the end game. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=874.44s)]
*  What's the risk preparing people for you know oral prices to go up and for our service members in the region to be a risk. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=875.96s)]
*  They're not even communicating any of this. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=882.52s)]
*  The only communication that comes from them are in these kind of random you know comments to the press that Trump's make makes in between meetings or on social media posts where they're like navigating their own internal MAGA. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=884.2800000000001s)]
*  Fight about this thing. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=896.7199999999999s)]
*  It's a crazy crazy crazy way to launch what could become not guaranteed but could become a really long and difficult war because of the regime change component of it. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=897.92s)]
*  Yeah it really does seem like Netanyahu played Trump perfectly here. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=910.24s)]
*  Or at least had a trap by bombing unilaterally because Netanyahu knows that the bar for this operation being judged a success will be whether the Fordo facility is operational at the end of it. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=914.7199999999999s)]
*  And he knows that only the US can take out Fordo with these massive ordinance penetrator like massive bunker buster bombs. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=925.68s)]
*  So either the US does his dirty work for him and eventually joins this war or he can blame Trump for not being fully successful. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. So like Trump's like you know feels trapped by the Fox News coverage that I want to talk about in a second. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=939.88s)]
*  And just in terms of the implications like again the early days of this war it feels like the Israelis are being incredibly successful because they are. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=947.04s)]
*  I mean the Mossad has obviously done an unbelievable job penetrating Iran's military and security establishment and a nuclear program. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=956.4399999999999s)]
*  Right. Like the fact that they knew where all these generals and these scientists lived and you know were able to target them on that first night is like an incredibly impressive intelligence operation. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=965.8399999999999s)]
*  But now Iran has recovered. They've been able to launch hundreds of ballistic missiles back at Israel. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=975.12s)]
*  And the New York Times just reported that Iran is preparing missiles for a possible retaliatory strike on US bases in the Middle East. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=981.04s)]
*  So we have about 40000 troops deployed in the Middle East. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  And the first people to get attacked would probably be US you know service members and diplomats serving in Iraq. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=992.52s)]
*  And then you know last night I saw one of the guys who got fired by Pete Hegseth tweeted out a long assessment of sort of what he knows about Iran's ballistic missile program. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=999.8s)]
*  He said it's about you know 2000 ballistic missiles. The choke point is they have more missiles than they have launchers and it takes time to fuel them and launch them and fire them. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1008.68s)]
*  But he said as far as he can tell Iran seems to have held back using some of its most advanced hypersonic missiles with the biggest payloads possibly because they wanted to keep them in reserve to target [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1016.84s)]
*  US interests if we get involved as some sort of deterrent. So that is some very ominous reporting from the New York Times right before we started recording. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1029.72s)]
*  Yeah and we talked about some of this a few days ago but there's what Iran could do in response right. The ballistic missile strikes that have already taken lives in Israel. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1039.08s)]
*  The strikes that they could do against US bases and facilities that could endanger our personnel. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1050.84s)]
*  Strikes that they could launch. I mean one of the reasons why the Arab states have come out vociferously against what Israel is doing. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1057.72s)]
*  I think that's in part because they know that Iran could just bomb Saudi oil fields as they've done in the past to try to just completely disrupt the global economy. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1063.52s)]
*  Because if they're going down they're going to take everybody down with them. That's still a possibility. They could obviously launch terrorist attacks in different places. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1072.32s)]
*  They could attack you know they could look even though their proxies are weakened they could do things in Iraq. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1080.16s)]
*  But even beyond that I think the important point is. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1086.04s)]
*  You could mine the street of Hormuz too. I mean there's a lot of things right. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1088.0s)]
*  Yes. Just just fuck up the global economy. Exactly right. But the other thing is the regime change part is what's so important here because in a way the more robust this Israeli war and maybe US Israeli war is the bigger the danger. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1089.72s)]
*  Because what if you do take out the regime. What if they do kill the supreme leader. Well who's going to be in charge of Iran. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1105.36s)]
*  You know and what we've seen in the past I mean Trump says that the skies we totally own the skies over Iran. Guess what. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1113.16s)]
*  We totally own the skies over Iraq. We totally own the skies over Afghanistan. We totally own the skies over Libya. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  And how did that turn out. This stuff always looks like you know when it looks like a video game in the first few days the same fucking people. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1126.8s)]
*  And it's the same people. It's like Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton and all these people that supported the Iraq war that every problem Middle East is a nail and they reach for the hammer. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1134.28s)]
*  You know the messier it gets the more unpredictable it gets and you more unforeseen the consequences and the more you get dragged in because there's a cycle of logic. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1144.52s)]
*  Well we bombed the Fordo thing and then they let's say they take out the Iranian regime and then it's like well we you know we need the US to go in there and and help stabilize you know make sure that the oil fields are secure and then we. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1153.36s)]
*  Are there going to be US troops in Iran right. I mean these are going to be questions that could be on us soon. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1165.24s)]
*  And again like nobody's explaining what the end state of this military action is that by the way the Iranian nuclear program would be set back about a year. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1170.12s)]
*  They blow up for though they still know how to do all this stuff they could take that underground and then what we're just we're just going to keep bombing and we're just kind of being this open ended state of war in Iran. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1179.32s)]
*  Never mind how that looks internationally never mind all the humanitarian issues. So this there's just so many questions and nobody's answering. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1190.0s)]
*  And again we've talked about how Trump shifted the Republican base the MAGA base into more of an anti war direction because he correctly I think identified and channeled anger at the post 9 11 regime change wars. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1196.48s)]
*  But the legacy Republican media has not adjusted at all like Fox News watching Fox this past week and I watch it most days all day. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1209.4399999999998s)]
*  It's given me flashbacks to like 2003 and the run up to the Iraq war. So like if you watch it Fox it's it's nonstop IDF you know handed out propaganda B roll of airstrikes. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1217.1999999999998s)]
*  It's interviews with hawkish voices and neo cons and like the Israeli ambassador to the US. You got Brett Baer doing softball interviews with Netanyahu where Netanyahu is like. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1229.48s)]
*  Spewing lies about the Iranian nuclear program in the timeline and getting no pushback and then then what was fascinating to me though was. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1241.36s)]
*  I caught an interview by Steve Bannon of Tucker Carlson will play some of more of it in a minute, but they were talking about Fox's coverage and this from Tucker Carlson about Fox's coverage jumped out of me. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1249.6799999999998s)]
*  Some of the same voices that the Fox platform. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1261.28s)]
*  You know the Fox platform is just it's so disgraceful what's you know there's so many good people at Fox. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  I work for the Murdochs for you know all in over 20 years I always like them I like them now not attacking them personally and tons of people at Fox are my friends. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1269.2800000000002s)]
*  But the one theme that runs longitudinally through the history of Fox is the promotion of wars that don't help the United States. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1278.24s)]
*  And I know is why is that it's the owners are committed to that vision. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1286.8000000000002s)]
*  But when it really comes down to when it's a question of whether. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1290.76s)]
*  US military power will be exerted on behalf of a foreign country thousands of miles from here they are all in and anyone who stands in the way will be destroyed I don't think it's personal by the way. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1294.48s)]
*  So that that was spot on from Tucker Carlson someone who would know but it's not just Fox been. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1303.68s)]
*  But it's not just Fox been. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1307.84s)]
*  Mathias Doppner is the CEO of Axel Springer which is like the big sort of media conglomerate that owns Politico. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1310.76s)]
*  He wrote this op ed they linked to it in Politico playbook. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1318.32s)]
*  So I read it. Here's a graph from it. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1321.12s)]
*  It is therefore surprising that Israel is not being celebrated worldwide for its historic extremely precise and necessary strike against Iranian nuclear weapons facilities. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1323.72s)]
*  And for the targeted killing of leading terrorists but that the public response is dominated by anti-Israel propaganda. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1332.64s)]
*  Now this is a CEO. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1339.16s)]
*  I don't I don't think he's like editing you know a news copy when it comes in or anything. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1340.56s)]
*  But like I don't know if you work at one of his publications you know damn well that critical coverage of this war is not going to be welcome. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1344.64s)]
*  Yeah. And this has been part of I mean the way in which we got into the Iraq war which again was not about Israel. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1352.48s)]
*  Right. That was just the US doing something really fucking stupid on its own. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1357.96s)]
*  Was in part having advisors who didn't understand you know these countries that they were going to invade and you know reconstruct you know what Donald Trump said right. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1362.48s)]
*  Like we said the nation builders over there we thought we could build a government in the Middle East and a culture we didn't understand. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1371.28s)]
*  But it was also this kind of xenophobic cheerleading media that you know made you know was just 100 percent behind taking us into war. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1376.88s)]
*  And it's extraordinary that like the exact same people in the exact same platforms are cranking up the exact same play all over again. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1388.1200000000001s)]
*  And you know what's interesting with Trump in the America first stuff is we'll sell Ukraine out you know we'll sell every ally in the world out you know the Europeans are now not our friends. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1397.6s)]
*  The Ukrainians are like leeches. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1409.04s)]
*  But if Israel wants to bomb you know in decapitating government in the Middle East it's like well how could we not be there. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1411.16s)]
*  And it's almost as if like you know the US is already a war because they make no distinction between what Netanyahu is doing. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1420.44s)]
*  It just gives him the authority to take us to war in Iran which is what he's trying to do and he's using Fox to talk to Trump. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1428.88s)]
*  I mean that's what he's doing in those interviews. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1438.32s)]
*  He's literally good they're going on all and not just him but all these idea people are going Fox are literally going on that for an audience of one. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1440.96s)]
*  You know I mean it helps that they get to talk to some right wing Americans too. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1447.48s)]
*  And it's a really strange thing to see. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1451.92s)]
*  And again to be very clear here this is that you can hate the Iranian regime. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1454.88s)]
*  I have I know plenty of Iranians who despise the Iranian regime and would love to see you know people who are involved in in the women's movement there would love to see a new government in Iran who are like deeply disturbed by what's happening in part because some people have family members in Iran who are endangered. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1460.48s)]
*  But in part because they know that this is not the Iranian people kind of removing their own government themselves. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1478.96s)]
*  That if you have Israel in the United States killing thousands of Iranians and decapitating their government you're likely to get like really hardcore reactionary IRGC types like running parts of that state whatever remains or like just a total failed state or some kind of civil war. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1485.36s)]
*  Because you do have different factions that would want to be competing for power and that's scary and nobody's talking about that. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1508.84s)]
*  There's nobody talking about that on Fox and all these people that love to spike the football now you know they're the people that you kind of can't find to do a Fox hit 10 years from now when you know things are a mess in that part of the world. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1515.08s)]
*  And so it's just we've seen this movie before. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1527.8s)]
*  Yeah man and the Atlantic to their credit had a great piece that quoted a bunch of members of the Iranian opposition some on the record who are really brave and someone background saying we don't want this this is not helping us. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1530.6399999999999s)]
*  We want to take down this regime but we don't want it this way not just because of the political change it could lead to but also because it's going to kill a bunch of innocent people and it's going to lead to shortages of food and medicine and fuel and immense suffering. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1541.8799999999999s)]
*  And then just even stepping further back out on sort of the coverage there's a lot of understandable coverage on sort of the impact on Israeli civilians in Tel Aviv and the horrific images of these like crushed civilian apartment buildings and things and people trapped in rubble. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1554.68s)]
*  And that's like totally appropriate and understandable and your heart breaks for those people. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1571.72s)]
*  But there is almost no coverage of that kind about the of the civilian toll happening in Iran. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1577.16s)]
*  Now part of that is because of a lack of media access. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1584.04s)]
*  Part of it is you know just because there's censorship laws etc. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1587.8s)]
*  But I do think it leads to a sense that people in Iran are somehow complicit in this or you know sort of like everyone is a combatant when it's just not the case like both sides. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1592.28s)]
*  There is immense suffering among civilian populations just as there is in Gaza. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1603.8799999999999s)]
*  And but I think that kind of like yeah there's a lack of coverage and I do think it's like genuinely damaging. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1610.04s)]
*  Yeah no I think that's right. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1616.44s)]
*  And I think in a strange and dark way Gaza kind of plowed some ground for this because that was been the experience of Gaza right. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1617.72s)]
*  That that like a single Israeli casualty gets an enormous amount of tension relative to like thousands of Palestinian casualties. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1625.64s)]
*  And there's a valuation of life human life and how these wars are covered. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1635.3600000000001s)]
*  And you look at it and by the way Iran is there are challenges you're right. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1640.8000000000002s)]
*  But it's not Gaza. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1644.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean there there are journalists there. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1645.0400000000002s)]
*  There's a capacity to report on this. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1647.0800000000002s)]
*  There are already hundreds of people if not thousands who've been killed in Iran. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1649.2800000000002s)]
*  There's like apartment buildings that have been destroyed or damaged. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1654.08s)]
*  You have Donald Trump tweeting that the city of Tehran needs to evacuate. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1658.84s)]
*  Terrifying 10 million people. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1662.84s)]
*  There are 10 million people in an incredibly densely populated city and they're Iranians who now are trying to get out their gas shortages. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1664.9199999999998s)]
*  People can't get out. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1671.4399999999998s)]
*  Life is disrupted. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1672.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean the casual way in which we you know what's interesting is the American people I thought had come to put a higher bar on going to war. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1674.48s)]
*  That we went we saw the failures of the post 9-11 wars. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1686.76s)]
*  And again I think Gaza has weirdly rolled back the tape and it feels cost free to kill people and to assassinate the leaders of countries or you know or to treat it again like a video game. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1692.6000000000001s)]
*  And again let's just name it too Tommy like these are brown people in Iran and Gaza and it's like they're all the same. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1707.4s)]
*  And like let's just you know it's not you know let's read like a heart wrenching story about Israelis in you know shelters in Tel Aviv. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1713.48s)]
*  And we don't really look at the Iranians who got killed in a war that the Israelis started. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1722.32s)]
*  Like so I don't know I find the lack of any that the default position isn't that war is bad. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1728.48s)]
*  You know like to be pretty pretty you know disgusting frankly. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1735.96s)]
*  Yep I totally agree with you. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1740.32s)]

*  All right. So back in March Ben Tulsi Gabbard the director of national intelligence testified before Congress about the U.S. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1929.04s)]
*  intelligence community's assessment of Iran's nuclear program. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1934.8s)]
*  She said the following quote the IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1938.4799999999998s)]

*  So end of quote. So Trump was asked about Tulsi Gabbard's testimony by the press during his flight back from the G7. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1951.2s)]
*  Here's his response. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1959.5600000000002s)]
*  Mr. President you've always said that you don't believe Iran should be able to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1960.56s)]
*  But how close do you personally think that they were to getting one? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1964.9199999999998s)]
*  Because Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that the intelligence community said Iran wasn't building a nuclear weapon. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1968.36s)]
*  I don't care what she said. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1975.32s)]
*  I think they were very close to having one. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1976.32s)]
*  So for those of you who couldn't hear that he said I don't care what she said. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1978.76s)]
*  So glad to see our president cares about the facts. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1981.84s)]
*  I was notable Ben that Trump had this big Camp David meeting about Iran earlier this month. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1984.96s)]
*  He didn't include Tulsi in that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1989.6399999999999s)]
*  In fact the CNN reported that U.S. intelligence believes that Iran was up to three years away as we mentioned earlier from being able to produce and deliver a nuclear weapon on target. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=1991.56s)]
*  However again so Trump he says to the press there he doesn't care what the intelligence assessment is. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2003.12s)]
*  There's this big debate about whether or not he's going to get involved. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2009.9599999999998s)]
*  We don't have many data points because as you mentioned earlier Trump has not addressed the country. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2013.8s)]
*  But he did truth the following things on Tuesday. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2017.8s)]
*  This all happened today. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2022.0s)]
*  These are verbatim quotes. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2023.6399999999999s)]
*  Unconditional surrender all caps exclamation point. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2025.24s)]
*  We know exactly where the so-called supreme leader is hiding. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2028.3999999999999s)]
*  He's an easy target. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2030.8s)]
*  But is safe there. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2032.56s)]
*  We're not going to take him out parentheses kill at least not for now. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2033.76s)]
*  But we don't want missile shot at civilians or American soldiers. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2037.72s)]
*  Our patience is wearing thin. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2040.36s)]
*  Thank you for attention to this matter. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2041.6s)]
*  And any truth. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2043.72s)]
*  We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2045.08s)]
*  Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment and plenty of it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2048.24s)]
*  But it doesn't compare to American made conceived and manufactured stuff. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2051.72s)]
*  Nobody does it better than the good old USA. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2055.48s)]
*  So he managed to I guess fit an ad for Raytheon into that last one. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2058.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2062.7599999999998s)]
*  So Ben that feels ominous. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2063.36s)]
*  It could be that our last best hope for kind of the anti-war coalition that's out [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2066.2s)]
*  there is Trump listening to parts of the MAGA coalition that has consistently said [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2071.16s)]
*  they want no part of this war. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2076.72s)]
*  Here are some examples of people who might make that case. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2078.7999999999997s)]
*  President Trump knows that the Bush era doctrine of regime change wars in the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2083.16s)]
*  Middle East is foolish. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2087.4399999999996s)]
*  It's costly and it is counterproductive as an anti-terrorism strategy. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2089.72s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember the last time Israel coaxed the United States into a [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2094.8s)]
*  regime change war in the Middle East. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2099.1600000000003s)]
*  And you imagine what happens in Iran now. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2100.76s)]
*  And you would think that they would probably be less likely to want to [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2103.1200000000003s)]
*  negotiate at this time, particularly when they may feel that negotiations were [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2105.4s)]
*  a ruse. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2109.32s)]
*  I'll call out Fox News and the New York Post. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2110.1600000000003s)]
*  They're known to be the neocon network news. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2112.7200000000003s)]
*  We have propaganda news on our side just like the left does. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2116.0s)]
*  Of course we don't want to see the people in Israel bombed, but they're only being [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2119.28s)]
*  bombed because Israel attacked Iran first. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2123.96s)]
*  You think that you think we're enjoying the combat offensive combat? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2128.2s)]
*  Well, we have to we have to we can't. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2132.2400000000002s)]
*  These things are never the product of like we have to stop. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2134.88s)]
*  We have to tell the police got hit. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2137.8s)]
*  Tehran's got hit. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2139.0s)]
*  Civilians are dead in both places. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2139.88s)]
*  And if we don't think that that's sad, then we're not fully human. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2142.16s)]
*  Like you have to believe that said and you have to really mean it. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2147.0s)]
*  So that was Matt Gates, Senator Rand Paul, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2149.7999999999997s)]
*  Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2155.2s)]
*  Again, it's weird to hear those guys, that group of people like sounding the most [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2157.24s)]
*  reasonable, making the most sense, being the most empathetic out of all the [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2162.88s)]
*  Republicans you hear talking about us about this war. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2167.48s)]
*  But like it is what it is, I guess. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2170.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's always been an internal inconsistency because Trump [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2173.24s)]
*  always campaigns as this anti-war guy, this America first guy. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2176.8s)]
*  But he also tries to be like this tough guy, you know, who's like the biggest [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2179.5600000000004s)]
*  Israel supporter, you know, he used to brag in the first term about, you know, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2184.6000000000004s)]
*  getting rid of civilian casualty restrictions on ISIS or dropping the [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2188.76s)]
*  mother of all bombs on Afghanistan. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2192.2000000000003s)]
*  So he's kind of he's never really been one or the other. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2194.8s)]
*  And and this is a real substantive divide, as you hear there. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2197.6000000000004s)]
*  I would say to people who are listening to this podcast, you know, if you made it [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2201.7200000000003s)]
*  this far and you're like, you know, these guys, you know, why don't these guys [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2205.36s)]
*  care about Israel and Israel should have to live with this threat? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2210.04s)]
*  Again, I think the substantive point I would make to you is that Israel did not [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2213.08s)]
*  have to do this at this point, that they could have seen how the Trump diplomacy [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2217.48s)]
*  went, it seemed like Iran wanted to deal. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2221.0s)]
*  Even if that didn't go well, they had, you know, potentially years before they [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2223.4s)]
*  needed to make this decision. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2227.36s)]
*  You should not launch a war unless you have to. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2228.36s)]
*  But I want to raise another point, which is that let's say this doesn't go that [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2231.04s)]
*  well, let's say that the U.S. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2236.2000000000003s)]
*  gets into this thing and it's clear this time that Israel started it and kind of [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2239.2000000000003s)]
*  pulled the U.S. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2244.48s)]
*  into it. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2245.2400000000002s)]
*  This could be dangerous for Israel, right? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2246.48s)]
*  Because I'm telling you where some of those people are going to go, right? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2249.32s)]
*  They sound reasonable now, but like a Marjorie Taylor Greene will suddenly like, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2252.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, be turning against Israel. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2257.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2258.88s)]
*  And so this kind of normalization of Israel just, you know, they went to war in [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2259.56s)]
*  Gaza or the West Bank or Lebanon or Syria or they're bombing Iraq or they're bombing [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2266.9599999999996s)]
*  Yemen and now they're going to war in Iran. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2271.9199999999996s)]
*  Like, and then the U.S. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2273.72s)]
*  gets dragged into it. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2274.72s)]
*  That could be really bad in the long run for not just Israel standing in the world, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2276.04s)]
*  because the rest of the world is looking at this and being like, this is some some [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2281.12s)]
*  fucked up shit that's happening here. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2284.52s)]
*  You know, there's no international law that says that this could happen. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2286.16s)]
*  But also, if it goes poorly, that's a huge risk in terms of this kind of right wing of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2291.44s)]
*  the United States like turning hard against Israel. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2296.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2299.84s)]
*  And, you know, Ben, there's you keep the thing they're kind of hanging their hat on [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2300.12s)]
*  now is Trump suggesting that, you know, he had given Iran 60 days to negotiate and [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2302.84s)]
*  then they didn't do it. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2309.2400000000002s)]
*  But we know from all the public reporting that the Trump administration couldn't get [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2310.64s)]
*  its own position straight for part of those 60 days. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2316.52s)]
*  Remember, there was a big sort of fight between Steve Wicoff and Marco Rubio and other [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2319.72s)]
*  hawks within the administration about whether Trump's position was whether Iran would [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2323.68s)]
*  be allowed to have like a low level enrichment program or no enrichment. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2328.2s)]
*  Right. So, you know, the idea that like there was some clear set of talks happening in [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2331.64s)]
*  Iran just wasn't being a constructive participant seems kind of unfair. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2337.7999999999997s)]
*  Also, you know, Trump had Steve Wicoff do it, someone with no experience for like a [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2342.16s)]
*  very highly technical set of talks. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2347.3599999999997s)]
*  So, again, I mean, like the idea that day 61 we had to bomb seems crazy to me. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2349.3599999999997s)]
*  The thing that I have been thinking about and worried about. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2353.9599999999996s)]
*  You're right. I agree with you that the political ramifications of this going south [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2356.6s)]
*  for Israel within the Republican Party could be very consequential. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2362.88s)]
*  I'm worried that we here in the West and in our media, they're going to kind of assess [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2368.56s)]
*  this thing on a day by day, week by week basis. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2374.04s)]
*  And the war could look good for a month or three months or six months or even a year. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2377.76s)]
*  But then three years from now, a bus full of American or Israeli tourists in South [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2382.48s)]
*  America blows up and it's Hezbollah or, you know, some sort of IRGC [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2388.2s)]
*  backed something or other. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2394.48s)]
*  Right. And it's like the time frame over which this could play out. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2396.12s)]
*  And the fact that, you know, U.S. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2401.6s)]
*  civilians could be a direct target because we are now perceived as being a party to [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2404.08s)]
*  this war is something that is just not it's not even being discussed in the coverage. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2408.04s)]
*  That's right. You know, one thing I think about, Tommy, is because look, there is [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2413.16s)]
*  here's the best case scenario. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2418.2s)]
*  Even the best case scenario is, you know, if Trump bombs Fordo, the best case [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2419.3599999999997s)]
*  scenario is the Iranian regime is just just kind of wants us to end and they kind of [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2425.2s)]
*  capitulate and and that somehow stops. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2430.0s)]
*  Somehow the Israelis accept not going full regime change and you've set the Iran [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2433.3999999999996s)]
*  nuclear program back. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2438.8799999999997s)]
*  And yes, there's been some war, but, you know, that that could happen even in that [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2440.3599999999997s)]
*  scenario, though. I think you could still see the kind of consequences you're talking [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2446.56s)]
*  about. And here's the example I give. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2450.6s)]
*  Do you remember in the first Trump administration when they moved the U.S. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2451.7999999999997s)]
*  embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and me and I think you and a bunch of people [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2454.04s)]
*  were like, well, this could be dangerous. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2460.36s)]
*  You know, this could kill the two state solution. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2462.52s)]
*  This could lead to violence. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2464.88s)]
*  And I remember that when they did that, there was some violence. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2466.44s)]
*  A bunch of Palestinians got killed because they charged the fence in Gaza. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2469.56s)]
*  And I think several dozen Palestinians got killed. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2473.04s)]
*  But there weren't like these huge terrorist attacks, you know. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2475.12s)]
*  And I remember all these people dunking on me online like, oh, you know, like you [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2477.88s)]
*  warned that this is going to be terrible. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2481.96s)]
*  And look, it turned out fine. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2484.28s)]
*  Well, you got October 7th a few years later. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2486.08s)]
*  Right. And I honestly think that, you know, killing the two state solution, moving the [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2489.44s)]
*  embassy, doing the Abraham Accords, cutting the Palestinians out of everything, you [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2494.64s)]
*  know, led to October 7th. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2498.52s)]
*  And these people don't understand that when we're warning of consequences, we're not [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2500.04s)]
*  saying that like next week the world is going to end. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2505.72s)]
*  And so then what they do is they hold you accountable to next week. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2508.7999999999997s)]
*  They're like, these guys said that this is going to go poorly, but look, they're [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2511.48s)]
*  bombing everything and it looks great on Fox News. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2515.12s)]
*  And then two years later, something horrible happens, like you said, and they [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2517.68s)]
*  it's like time starts then and it's like, well, we have to go bomb them because this [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2522.2s)]
*  horrible thing happened and we never take responsibility for being the ones who [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2525.92s)]
*  contributed to this chain of events. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2530.76s)]
*  You know? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2532.6s)]
*  A couple of important sort of political considerations, banner of political points. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2535.32s)]
*  There's a movement in Congress to try to prevent this war. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2540.32s)]
*  So Congressman Thomas Massey, conservative Republican and Democrat Ro Khanna have put [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2542.8s)]
*  forward a resolution that would prohibit the United States from getting involved in [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2547.88s)]
*  the war. I think AOC is now a co-sponsor. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2551.8s)]
*  They correctly argue that a war with Iran would have to be authorized by Congress. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2554.7200000000003s)]
*  We sort of that that's also gone from the debate. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2560.0s)]
*  Tim Kaine has a similar resolution on the Senate side. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2562.8s)]
*  Bernie Sanders has a no war against Iran act that he's introduced. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2565.52s)]
*  So good folks are doing some good work there. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2569.56s)]
*  But, you know, I don't have a lot of hope that the Republican led Congress will pick [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2571.48s)]
*  up those pieces of legislation. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2575.52s)]
*  But then more broadly, just on the politics of this, I mean, you and I were talking [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2578.1600000000003s)]
*  about how you can kind of feel some Democrats who you know are opposed to the war on [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2581.44s)]
*  Iran, who have been warning against it for years, starting to get a little squishy [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2586.2000000000003s)]
*  because the early results look favorable for the Israelis. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2591.56s)]
*  And like to them, I would just say, first of all, stand up for what you believe in, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2595.92s)]
*  for God's sake, or what's what's the point of being in politics. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2599.64s)]
*  And then to, again, remember how shock and how looked in the first few weeks and then [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2602.16s)]
*  how it morphed into something very different. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2607.2400000000002s)]
*  Like this war has not even been going on for a week. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2609.2799999999997s)]
*  The idea that we know the outcome and should just like capitulate and follow Bibi Netanyahu's [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2612.16s)]
*  lead is crazy. And there was some polling out today. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2617.2799999999997s)]
*  The economist YouGov had a new poll. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2619.6s)]
*  They asked, do you think the U.S. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2621.56s)]
*  military should get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2623.4399999999996s)]
*  Sixteen percent said yes. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2627.08s)]
*  Sixty six zero percent said no. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2629.2s)]
*  And only 19 percent of Trump 2024 voters support U.S. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2631.8399999999997s)]
*  military involvement. Fifty three percent are opposed. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2635.8399999999997s)]
*  So like the polling is just crystal clear that no one in this country wants to be [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2638.84s)]
*  involved in another regime change war in the Middle East. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2643.4s)]
*  I'm really glad you framed it this way, because first of all, a lot of these people, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2646.6400000000003s)]
*  they're just kind of looking out the window. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2651.6800000000003s)]
*  And what they're forgetting is that the very things they warned about, you know, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2653.44s)]
*  Iran could go underground to try to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2658.52s)]
*  The regime could collapse and you could get a failed state in Iran. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2661.52s)]
*  Like there could be terrorist attacks. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2664.7200000000003s)]
*  There were never things that were going to happen in the first week or two. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2666.2s)]
*  You know, like so it's not like objectively the military operation isn't going, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2669.0s)]
*  quote unquote, better than was anticipated when people had that sense. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2674.2400000000002s)]
*  All that's happening is you have the normal juggernaut of political and media [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2678.48s)]
*  momentum towards this is great and we have to support this and look at this war. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2683.12s)]
*  The things are blowing up and let's watch on television and you're weak if you [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2687.52s)]
*  don't support it. And I would say to Democrats, there are a lot of people who [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2690.96s)]
*  spent the rest of their political careers regretting their position. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2695.52s)]
*  They took on the Iraq war. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2698.36s)]
*  You and I worked in the White House, Tommy, and probably have this podcast [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2699.68s)]
*  because Hillary Clinton voted for the Iraq war, you know, which probably seemed [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2702.92s)]
*  like the safe thing to do in 2003. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2706.4s)]
*  And that's how Barack Obama was able to beat her in 2008. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2708.4s)]
*  So there's a whole host of ways in this, in which this could go wrong in the [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2711.16s)]
*  medium term and by the time Democrats are thinking about who they're going to [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2715.52s)]
*  support as the party's center bearer next time, those consequences are probably [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2718.84s)]
*  going to be happening. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2722.36s)]
*  But even if they don't, right, and this is a really important thing, and I hope [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2723.4s)]
*  any Democrats listening like at least hears me out on this, even if they don't [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2727.6s)]
*  happen, even if somehow, you know, they destroy Fordo and, you know, there's [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2732.08s)]
*  some kind of messy de-escalation and everything kind of settles down, you [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2739.44s)]
*  should still be against this. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2744.36s)]
*  We're Democrats. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2746.0s)]
*  Do we really support preemptive wars in which you try to kill the leadership of [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2747.44s)]
*  other countries, no matter how odious those countries, governments are? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2752.96s)]
*  Regime change authorizations by fascist Israeli right-wing leaders based on [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2756.36s)]
*  intelligence no one has seen? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2762.36s)]
*  No legal basis for the United States to be doing this. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2763.84s)]
*  No basis in national law for this to be happening. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2766.68s)]
*  Civilians getting killed in Tehran and civilians getting put at risk in Israel. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2769.12s)]
*  You are so afraid of getting called weak that you're going to go along with [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2773.04s)]
*  something that is that immoral and unethical and against every principle [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2778.56s)]
*  that the Democratic Party as people that are supposed to value the equality of [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2782.7999999999997s)]
*  human beings cares about? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2786.04s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2788.52s)]
*  I would not support any Democrat like who, for president, who, who, who [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2789.24s)]
*  capitulates to that kind of thinking. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2794.3599999999997s)]
*  We've been there before. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2796.48s)]
*  We're better than that. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2797.52s)]
*  And we should stand for something and not be afraid to be like dunked on by the [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2798.64s)]
*  same group of Lindsey Grims that are going to dunk on us anyway. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2804.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2807.52s)]
*  So get some backbone Democrats. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2807.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2810.12s)]
*  And look on the merits, what is happening in Gaza is deplorable and evil and [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2810.24s)]
*  immoral and just wrong on every level. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2816.52s)]
*  But there was also part of my frustration with Joe Biden's policy towards Gaza and [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2818.84s)]
*  in dealing with Netanyahu was that he allowed the United States to be pushed [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2824.36s)]
*  around by Bibi Netanyahu and the listeners of the show know that we are not big fans [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2829.2799999999997s)]
*  of Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2834.32s)]
*  He's corrupt. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2835.32s)]
*  He's a liar. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2836.04s)]
*  He puts his own political considerations ahead of the security of his country. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2837.04s)]
*  But on top of that, despite calling himself like Mr. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2841.6400000000003s)]
*  Security, he was catastrophically wrong about the most consequential foreign [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2845.5600000000004s)]
*  policy decision of our lifetime. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2850.7200000000003s)]
*  This is a clip of Netanyahu giving quote unquote expert testimony to Congress [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2853.1600000000003s)]
*  about Iraq before the invasion. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2858.52s)]
*  This is from 2002. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2860.52s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2861.6000000000004s)]
*  And this is a tyrant who is feverishly trying to acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2862.4s)]
*  And today the United States must destroy the same regime because a nuclear armed [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2867.48s)]
*  Saddam will place the security of our entire world at risk. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2872.32s)]
*  He is simply not reflecting the reality to assume that Saddam isn't feverishly [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2877.6800000000003s)]
*  working to develop nuclear weapons. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2888.88s)]
*  If you take out Saddam, Saddam's regime, I guarantee you that it will have [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2891.32s)]

*  The more victories you amass, the easier the next victory becomes. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2900.04s)]
*  The first victory in Afghanistan makes a second victory in Iraq that much easier. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2903.7200000000003s)]
*  Catastrophically wrong about fucking everything. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2910.32s)]
*  Every single point he made there was catastrophic. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2913.96s)]
*  And we weren't cherry picking from that. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2916.28s)]
*  He was fucking wrong about everything. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2917.8s)]
*  And now he's making the exact same arguments for a regime change war based on some real, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2920.16s)]
*  at least for now, secret intelligence about WMD and Iran. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2926.88s)]
*  The fact that anyone would follow this fucking guy into another regime change war [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2930.7599999999998s)]
*  is insane to me. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2934.4s)]
*  Is that who you all want to follow? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2935.64s)]
*  I mean, he guaranteed it, right? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2937.64s)]
*  It'd work out so great. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2939.0s)]
*  And the only thing I have to add to that, Tommy, because it's so clear, is the third [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2940.12s)]
*  victory, he clearly had Iran in mind back then. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2945.36s)]
*  Of course he did. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2948.48s)]
*  He didn't stop at the second victory. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2949.84s)]
*  He said that victory in Afghanistan, which didn't turn out to be victory, leaded the [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2952.0s)]
*  second victory in Iraq and then make the third victory easier. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2955.36s)]
*  He was thinking about Iran in that testimony, right? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2958.52s)]
*  And this is someone you're going to follow into a war? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2961.48s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2963.88s)]
*  Like when Donald Trump was elected, I was despondent on every single level. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2964.84s)]
*  The one possible silver lining was I thought there was a chance he would have the fucking [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2969.28s)]
*  balls in the political leverage to stand up to Bibi Netanyahu, but to watch him get [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2973.6s)]
*  led around like this and just become Bibi's little lapdog in the face of a [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2978.72s)]
*  catastrophic regime change war in Iran, it's just so unbelievably pathetic and [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2983.56s)]
*  disappointing. He looks so goddamn weak. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2988.72s)]
*  Yeah. And look, we should keep repeating it. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2991.0s)]
*  I mean, I hear you guys on Positive America sometimes talking about the need to repeat [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2995.2s)]
*  the tax cuts, the billionaires. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=2998.8399999999997s)]
*  He said he'd end the war in Ukraine on day one. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3001.56s)]
*  That war has escalated. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3003.3599999999997s)]
*  He said he'd end the war in Gaza. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3004.52s)]
*  That war has gotten worse. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3005.72s)]
*  He said he would stop this war to make a deal. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3007.12s)]
*  And now we've got a war here like this. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3009.2s)]
*  This is just more chaos. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3011.64s)]
*  And it's its weakness in this case. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3013.2s)]
*  It is weakness. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3015.08s)]
*  He's afraid to stand up to Putin in Ukraine. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3016.24s)]
*  He's afraid to stand up to Netanyahu in the Middle East. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3018.3999999999996s)]
*  And that's ultimately potentially going to put us at risk. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3020.3999999999996s)]
*  It's just it's just terrible. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3024.72s)]
*  It's completely demoralizing. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3028.3599999999997s)]
*  All right, Ben, that's all I got. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3029.8799999999997s)]
*  Anything else you want to get off your chest about this war, Netanyahu, anything else [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3030.9599999999996s)]
*  going on? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3034.3599999999997s)]
*  No, no. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3034.9599999999996s)]
*  I mean, you know, we definitely covered the waterfront on this one. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3035.52s)]
*  It is it is like the only thing I will say, Tommy, is that as people who are old [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3039.12s)]
*  enough to remember the Iraq War debates, it's kind of interesting to watch like [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3043.28s)]
*  what it would have been like if Twitter existed in 2003. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3046.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3049.88s)]
*  Because I saw like John Pothertz or whatever his name is like dunking on you. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3050.6s)]
*  I was like, I haven't thought about that guy since the Iraq War when he was like [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3054.6s)]
*  the biggest cheerleader for that. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3058.24s)]
*  John Pothertz tweeted out an article his father had written 15 years ago about [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3059.96s)]
*  how he needed to bomb Iran. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3063.96s)]
*  He was like, thank God my 90 year old dad is still alive to see this. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3065.2s)]
*  I was like, oh, intergenerational bloodlust. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3068.24s)]
*  What a what a beautiful thing. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3070.0s)]
*  It bet it's been fascinating. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3071.64s)]
*  Like the media changes are fascinating in that. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3072.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes, social media exists. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3074.52s)]
*  Fox News is exactly the same, but it's like the far right networks like the OANs [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3076.68s)]
*  were like Matt Gaetz is a host suddenly are antiwar. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3081.24s)]
*  There are these interesting new dynamics. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3084.16s)]
*  Unfortunately, none of them are strong enough to push back of the like kind of [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3085.72s)]
*  Tom Cotton to the world and the Netanyahu's and the inertia of Washington just being a [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3088.72s)]
*  city that is just has bloodlust and is just horny for war at all times. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3093.6s)]
*  And that is a bipartisan criticism. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3098.04s)]
*  Yeah, I told you I've been going down this kind of Vietnam book rabbit hole in its [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3100.88s)]
*  ear. It was like that decades ago. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3104.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, the one last thing I'd say is it's interesting, like for all the talk of [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3105.8399999999997s)]
*  Trump, you know, completely transforming the Republican Party and in many ways he [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3109.56s)]
*  has. He is not. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3112.68s)]
*  It's interesting on this stuff. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3115.6s)]
*  These are the same cleavages that have been in the Republican Party for decades. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3116.64s)]
*  There's always been these isolationist America first years and they've always been [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3121.3599999999997s)]
*  these kind of neocon hawks. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3124.7599999999998s)]
*  And Trump turns out didn't resolve that. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3126.52s)]
*  Yeah, he stitched them all together to win a couple of elections. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3129.6s)]
*  The question is whether this could rip it apart. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3132.52s)]
*  I don't know. We'll we'll find out, I guess. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3135.3599999999997s)]
*  OK, we're going to take a quick break. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3137.92s)]
*  We come back here and hear my debate with Congressman Greg Landsman about the wars [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3139.04s)]
*  in Iran and Gaza. He is a supporter of the Israeli effort in Iran. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3144.72s)]
*  He has been someone who's been a pretty strong backer of the war in Gaza. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3149.28s)]
*  So we debate it all. And let me know what you think. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3153.44s)]

*  My guest today represents Ohio's first congressional district. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3369.16s)]
*  Congressman Greg Landsman, how are you doing? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3372.48s)]
*  I'm OK. How are you doing? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3374.52s)]
*  Good. A little background for listeners. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3375.88s)]
*  So Greg and I met I think in D.C. a while back and we hung out in L.A. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3377.56s)]
*  I can't remember which was first. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3381.4s)]
*  But we've been friends for several years now. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3383.68s)]
*  You're someone I consider a friend. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3385.44s)]
*  It's weird to be friends with elected officials. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3386.56s)]
*  I still feel like a little teen staffer at the back of the room, like intimidated by the [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3388.6s)]
*  title. But often our friendship has entailed intense, passionate debates about the war in [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3393.04s)]
*  Gaza. We've had some pretty profound disagreements. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3400.72s)]
*  But what I always really, truly respect and appreciate about you is how thoughtful you [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3403.2s)]
*  are in those conversations and how decent you are. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3410.08s)]
*  And so I think we both figured like, I don't know, let's let's take this thing live. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3413.0s)]
*  Right. So let's let's talk about not just Gaza, but also this brand new war with Iran. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3416.52s)]
*  Sound good? Yeah, of course. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3423.12s)]
*  And I have the feelings mutual. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3425.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know, this is one of the most complicated, if not the most complicated issues [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3426.6s)]
*  in the world. And to have legitimate debate is really important to be able to talk about [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3433.16s)]
*  this with people that you trust, who I think ultimately have the same, you know, goal, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3442.48s)]
*  right, or goals, which is you want security and peace and something that's sustainable [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3451.4s)]
*  in the region for Palestinians, for Israelis, for the Lebanese, for Syrians, for everyone [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3458.52s)]
*  and for Iranians. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3464.6400000000003s)]
*  And how you get there is not at all clear. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3468.28s)]
*  Or it's not simple. It's not simple at all. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3474.84s)]
*  And I think just having a conversation that both of us know is in good faith and coming [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3476.52s)]
*  from a good place, I think sort of the best we can do. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3480.56s)]
*  But first, I know that on Sunday you were told by law enforcement, by the Capitol Police, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3483.88s)]
*  I believe, that your name was included on a list being carried by that lunatic guy in [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3489.7999999999997s)]
*  Minnesota who murdered Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3495.88s)]
*  who wounded two others. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3500.3599999999997s)]
*  I just I can't imagine how scary that was. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3502.0s)]
*  Learning that, knowing, you know, at the time, the suspect was still at large. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3505.3199999999997s)]
*  So just, you know, how you doing? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3508.88s)]
*  And like, do we know anything more about this guy's motives or what the hell he was doing? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3510.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm good. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3515.0s)]
*  I know what you know. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3516.64s)]
*  And, you know, this is clearly an unwell person, you know, who targeted Democratic [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3519.0s)]
*  lawmakers. He had a list, multiple lists. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3524.84s)]
*  And for whatever reason, I was on one of the lists, the list in his car, the, quote, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3528.52s)]
*  unquote, hit list. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3535.32s)]
*  I found out about it Sunday morning. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3537.92s)]
*  We were called by Capitol Police. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3540.6800000000003s)]
*  And and, you know, at first you're just, you know, it's it's sort of bizarre. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3542.1200000000003s)]
*  And then you start to do the math. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3549.36s)]
*  You know, the drive time between Minnesota and Ohio is probably 10 hours, 12, you know, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3551.2000000000003s)]
*  12 at the most. You know, I don't know exactly where he was. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3556.2400000000002s)]
*  And at that point, you know, no one knew where he was. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3559.76s)]
*  And there was a point in the evening, you know, we beefed up security and there's a [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3562.68s)]
*  cop outside. And he texted me and just said, can you turn on, you know, the outdoor [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3567.08s)]
*  lights and turn off the indoor lights? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3572.0s)]
*  And it was it was just precautionary. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3574.24s)]
*  But, you know, I didn't know. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3575.88s)]
*  And I thought maybe he saw something. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3578.84s)]
*  And it's hard to get that picture of that guy in the in that mask out of your head. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3581.88s)]
*  Yeah. And so, you know, there was probably 30 minutes, 40 minutes. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3587.12s)]
*  Where I thought maybe this guy's in my backyard. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3592.52s)]
*  Yeah. In any event, they ultimately got him at 1030. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3595.16s)]
*  And at that point, you're sort of like, oh, well, that's it. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3599.84s)]
*  But, you know, it's I will say it's one of those things where. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3604.04s)]
*  You know, it's getting worse. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3609.64s)]
*  You just know it's getting worse, whether you're at the, you know, in the middle of [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3611.68s)]
*  it or not, like we can all see what's happening. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3616.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And like, first of all, again, I'm just I'm so sorry that you had to go [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3619.56s)]
*  through that. It's terrifying for you. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3624.4s)]
*  It's terrifying for your wife, for your kids, everyone around you. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3625.8s)]
*  That image is horrifying. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3631.28s)]
*  Like that guy in the mask is terrifying. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3632.68s)]
*  And then like Mike Lee, like making jokes about it. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3634.2s)]
*  And he's, you know, crazy. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3636.24s)]
*  That's how I saw the picture. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3637.44s)]
*  I saw the picture from Mike Lee's tweet. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3638.68s)]
*  Somebody sent me Mike Lee's tweet. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3642.48s)]
*  And that's where I saw the picture. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3644.04s)]
*  So the only reason I had the image in my head was because Mike Lee decided to be an [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3645.48s)]
*  asshole and and and make light of this matter, further politicize it, which is the [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3650.2000000000003s)]
*  last thing we need. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3656.76s)]
*  And I hope Mike Lee wakes up tomorrow morning and realizes, you know, what an asshole [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3658.56s)]
*  he was and says, look, I'm sorry, I want to be part of the solution. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3662.84s)]
*  I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have been so cavalier about the fact that, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3667.48s)]
*  you know, people were murdered. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3671.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're OK. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3673.0s)]
*  And I'm grateful for you talking to me about it and still doing the show. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3674.6s)]
*  OK, so let's let's talk about the war between Israel and Iran. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3679.24s)]
*  Listeners will just heard, you know, Ben and I do a whole like sort of show about the [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3684.48s)]
*  latest developments. So I'll skip the big wind up. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3687.72s)]
*  But why do you think that this Israeli operation against Iran is the right thing to [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3690.0s)]
*  do is necessary? I was just hoping you kind of make the case. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3696.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the the initial goal is to diminish, derail the nuclear capabilities of [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3700.0s)]
*  Iran. And, you know, that's all the above ground stuff. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3707.7999999999997s)]
*  And to do something similar to Iran's ballistic missile program, you know, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3712.64s)]
*  ultimately ending their nuclear capabilities is is is what should should happen. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3720.56s)]
*  That involves, as you know better than anyone, you know, below ground stuff that [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3728.6s)]
*  Israel may or may not be able to do on its own. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3734.7599999999998s)]
*  But if you're if you get to the point where Iran is no longer an existential threat, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3737.96s)]
*  not just to Israel, but to others in the Middle East and to the United States, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3743.88s)]
*  because of this regime, not because of the Iranian people, but because of this regime, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3749.2s)]
*  then, you know, you're talking about a fundamentally different landscape in the [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3754.48s)]
*  Middle Middle East and the pathways to peace become much, much more straightforward. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3760.48s)]
*  I mean, it just I think it is the end all be all in terms of getting to peace that Iran [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3768.96s)]
*  is the last remaining this regime is the last remaining big barrier to peace. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3774.92s)]
*  And I understand that people have very strong feelings that there are other big [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3782.68s)]
*  barriers to peace. And I'm my my position is that if you can if you can get Iran off [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3789.3199999999997s)]
*  the table, this regime where they no longer have existential the ability to, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3795.44s)]
*  you know, to to, you know, drop a atomic weapon that you have dismantled their terror [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3802.52s)]
*  networks, you know, Hezbollah has gone Hamas has gone, the Houthis are gone, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3809.88s)]
*  terror cells and Syria and Iraq are not being funded. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3815.92s)]
*  You you then are liberating not just Iran, but Lebanon, Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Iraq. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3819.4s)]
*  Well, so OK, so part of what you're talking about there, like this this bigger picture [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3827.6400000000003s)]
*  goal where Hezbollah has gone Hamas has gone, the Houthis gone, that's like a bigger, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3832.48s)]
*  spicier meatball. So let's get to that in a second. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3837.7999999999997s)]
*  But just on the on the nuclear program, I guess I'm I don't understand the timing. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3840.2s)]
*  Netanyahu suggesting that Iran was on the cusp of getting a nuclear weapon, that there [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3846.3199999999997s)]
*  was some new intelligence that indicated that they were about to break out. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3849.8399999999997s)]
*  The The New York Times reported that the U.S. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3855.2799999999997s)]
*  knows of no new intelligence that sped up the timeline or that Iran was rushing to get [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3859.08s)]
*  a bomb. The Wall Street Journal has a report that there might be some sort of good faith [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3862.8399999999997s)]
*  disagreement on the intelligence picture. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3867.48s)]
*  But I think most experts believe, yes, Iran could enrich enough nuclear material [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3869.4s)]
*  to weapons grade to have what you need for a bomb in a week or two. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3875.72s)]
*  But then it would take months, if not years, to fit it into a warhead, to weaponize it [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3881.16s)]
*  and then even longer to get it onto a missile to deliver it to various places. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3886.68s)]
*  So I don't understand the sort of imminence of the threats. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3890.68s)]
*  Also on the timing, I mean, you've got the IDF has just fought this 20 month war in [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3893.2400000000002s)]
*  Gaza. They have talked publicly about like severe ammunition shortages. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3897.84s)]
*  They've lost a huge number of armored vehicles. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3902.5200000000004s)]
*  There's this big drop in reservists showing up. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3905.1200000000003s)]
*  I saw one report said over 100000 Israeli reservists failed to show up. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3907.36s)]
*  The ones who do are exhausted. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3911.4s)]
*  You've got thousands, if not tens of thousands of Israeli reservists calling for an end [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3914.36s)]
*  to the war and the ceasefire. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3919.44s)]
*  The Israeli economy has taken a big hit because of the war, both because of like a [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3920.92s)]
*  reduction in tourism and the cost of the direct action. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3924.4s)]
*  And then like the Israeli people are exhausted. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3928.56s)]
*  Iran itself is sort of diplomatically isolated. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3931.2000000000003s)]
*  And Trump was in the midst of this diplomatic effort. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3934.0s)]
*  And so I just I just don't get why he would rush this and why this was necessary now [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3937.88s)]
*  and whether or whether you think it was appropriate to move this quickly. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3946.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think there's two schools of thought. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3950.36s)]
*  There's always been two schools of thought, at least in the last, I don't know, 10 [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3953.04s)]
*  years or longer, 15 years. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3956.32s)]
*  Like one is there is a diplomatic pathway for you know, with Iran. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3959.2400000000002s)]
*  And that was obviously something that you all pursued. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3963.8s)]
*  And there are strong arguments for that pathway. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3966.4s)]
*  There's also the the the argument that there are there are no real diplomatic plays with Iran. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3970.16s)]
*  Iran isn't going to play by the rules in the end because of who this regime is and what [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3976.92s)]
*  their intentions are. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3983.16s)]
*  So, yes, they were meeting, but they weren't making any real progress as as as we [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3985.0s)]
*  understand. And this is about as weak as Iran has been. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3991.7599999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, when you have an existential threat that close to breaking out, you [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=3997.32s)]
*  know, you can easily make the case that this is your moment and that you've waited too [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4005.44s)]
*  long. There are some Israelis who believe that there are obviously some people who believe [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4011.84s)]
*  that that Israel should have done this sooner. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4016.32s)]
*  And now, you know, whether it was, you know, the right time or not, it has happened. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4019.76s)]
*  And, you know, I think the big question has to be, you know, as Israel focuses entirely [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4029.0400000000004s)]
*  on these these military targets. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4035.8s)]
*  And if there is the possibility of ending what's happening, the enrichment work that's [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4040.84s)]
*  happening underground, does Israel get the support they need to finish this? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4047.8s)]
*  I would hope so. And I and I understand you want the US to directly get involved. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4054.0s)]
*  You want I mean, basically, we're talking about is the US B1 or B2 bombers dropping the [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4058.32s)]
*  massive ordnance penetrators, 30,000 pound bunker busting bomb on Fordo or their buried [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4062.16s)]
*  sites. You think that's what should happen? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4067.44s)]
*  I think that Fordo has to go. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4069.8s)]
*  And how they do that, you know, whether it's something that, you know, if if Trump decides, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4072.8799999999997s)]
*  well, we'll just give them the bombers and let Israel do it. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4078.48s)]
*  OK, I mean, I but I think this is you have a moment of truth like you can finish it, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4082.2799999999997s)]
*  finish it. Now, if Iran comes back and says, OK, we would like to negotiate and they get [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4086.72s)]
*  to a real place of legitimate desire to be done, to shift to a civil program, to have [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4093.2799999999997s)]
*  real inspections. And I think it has to include any deal has to include dismantling these [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4103.639999999999s)]
*  terror armies so that Lebanon can be free. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4110.32s)]
*  Gaza can be free. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4113.5599999999995s)]
*  Syria that they are they are done. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4115.8s)]
*  They have to get rid of Hamas and Hezbollah. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4119.2s)]
*  You know, and and the world is would be for that. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4123.12s)]
*  The world would all jump in and support those efforts and help those countries rebuild. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4126.4800000000005s)]
*  There would be enough money for Gaza, enough money for Lebanon, enough money for Syria, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4132.52s)]
*  I would I would think on the negotiations. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4136.52s)]
*  I mean, there's this sense. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4139.04s)]
*  Bibi keep saying like, oh, Trump gave him 60 days. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4140.360000000001s)]
*  You know, we got to 61. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4143.240000000001s)]
*  So I bombed. I just think that's like self-evidently bullshit like Trump had scheduled [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4144.4400000000005s)]
*  talks for day 63 with Witkoff. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4148.280000000001s)]
*  There are some reports that Witkoff was kind of like unwilling or unable to engage in [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4151.04s)]
*  real detail at some of these meetings and also like he's sending a real estate guy with [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4156.24s)]
*  no subject matter expertise to lead the effort in the first place. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4159.92s)]
*  I think it's going to slow things down. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4162.72s)]
*  So I just sort of like think holding to that timeline is a little bit unfair. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4164.0s)]
*  That said, it does seem to me that Trump was sincerely pursuing a JCPOA like nuclear [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4167.76s)]
*  deal. And to me, I think that's obviously better path for a few reasons. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4174.08s)]
*  The first is that the Obama era deal worked from 2015 to 2018. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4178.76s)]
*  The IAEA issued over a dozen reports showing that Iran was complying. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4183.84s)]
*  Iran shipped out their nuclear stockpile. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4188.2s)]
*  They disabled this this manhole centrifuges. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4190.12s)]
*  They gave inspectors more access. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4192.6s)]
*  They disabled this heavy water reactor at Iraq. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4194.12s)]
*  Trump staff, his own team testified before Congress that Iran was complying. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4197.92s)]
*  And then when Trump pulled out of the JCPOA, Iran still stayed in compliance for a while [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4202.4s)]
*  until we started sanctioning them. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4207.48s)]
*  And then ultimately, when the US killed Qasem Soleimani, I think they started enriching [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4208.84s)]
*  again. And they also at that time ramped up support for proxy groups in the Middle [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4212.92s)]
*  East like Hezbollah and the Houthis. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4218.0s)]
*  So I guess where I'm coming from is, look, I hate this Iranian leadership. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4220.08s)]
*  I think they do horrible things, not just to Israel, but to their own people. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4223.0s)]
*  Right. Like they've thrown friends of mine in jail for literally years. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4226.639999999999s)]
*  But I think the record shows is that the best way to deal with them is through diplomacy. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4230.96s)]
*  And I think history shows that you could the way you can permanently verifiably get [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4236.24s)]
*  countries to get rid of their nuclear programs is through diplomacy, which is what South [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4240.72s)]
*  Africa did in the 90s. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4244.92s)]
*  It's what Ukraine did after the fall of the Soviet Union. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4246.599999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, I think we could bomb the shit out of Fordo. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4250.96s)]
*  We can hit it with every bunker buster bomb in our arsenal. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4253.5199999999995s)]
*  Basically, what Iran needs is like a couple of advanced cascades, centrifuges, a couple [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4256.5199999999995s)]
*  of weeks, and they can enrich enough nuclear material to have what they need to build a [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4262.4s)]
*  bomb in some other covert facility. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4266.799999999999s)]
*  Like you can't we can't bomb the know how out of them, even if the U.S. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4268.799999999999s)]
*  and Israel kill all of these nuclear scientists. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4273.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you can do an enormous amount of damage and they already have. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4276.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, they have Israel has done an enormous amount of damage to Iranian air defenses, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4280.0s)]
*  to their ballistic missile program and to, you know, the the the nuclear nuclear capabilities. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4287.36s)]
*  I a couple of things. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4296.96s)]
*  One is on on the time, I want to come back to it because I, you know. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4298.32s)]
*  I have seen, you know, reports out of CENCOM that there were there were very serious [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4303.759999999999s)]
*  concerns. I get you're right that it's about how you read the intelligence and obviously [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4309.639999999999s)]
*  the IDF is going to read it one way as opposed to the way our folks are. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4314.2s)]
*  To I I want to believe that Iran would get this regime would get to a place where they [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4321.0s)]
*  could they could negotiate honestly and that it would include all of the things that you [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4328.96s)]
*  and I would want included. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4335.44s)]
*  And and maybe this is the path to do that, that that that the sword is a is an incentive [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4337.52s)]
*  enough. The damage that has been done and just how weakened Iran is, this regime is [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4346.68s)]
*  based on the events of the last year or two and the events of the last couple of days [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4355.320000000001s)]
*  that they are so weakened that they will do an actual a real deal. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4361.280000000001s)]
*  Now, I I want to be incredibly respectful for the work that you all did. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4365.16s)]
*  The argument against, you know, and because I'm sure you've made it, but I know the [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4370.4800000000005s)]
*  argument that you hear when you're in the region, they say that it was time bound. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4375.320000000001s)]
*  You know, the the the the original agreement with Iran. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4383.56s)]
*  And we could have just renegotiated it all along, right, and never let her out to [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4386.68s)]
*  enrich to where they got to. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4390.0s)]
*  So that's a huge mistake in Trump's book. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4391.280000000001s)]
*  Anyway, it was time bound. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4394.04s)]
*  But they got they got a lot of money up front, right, because a lot of the assets were [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4395.76s)]
*  unfrozen. And that money ultimately made its way to, you know, arguably to Hezbollah and [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4400.599999999999s)]
*  Hamas that the inspections weren't as great as as as as people wanted them to be, that [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4408.4s)]
*  there were serious holes questions, mostly because Iran is known or this regime is known [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4416.12s)]
*  as a bad actor when it comes to some of this stuff. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4423.6s)]
*  So, you know, there were there were issues. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4427.96s)]
*  And, you know, I I think you you have to put yourself in the shoes of the people who [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4432.160000000001s)]
*  are the most vulnerable to us being wrong. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4441.320000000001s)]
*  And that is the Israelis. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4445.56s)]
*  And, you know, part of the challenge here is that Netanyahu has lost a lot of trust [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4450.12s)]
*  with a lot of people. And so you come to a moment like this where, you know, I think [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4455.639999999999s)]
*  it makes sense to go and say, we're not going to let you get any further in terms of [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4461.4s)]
*  enrichment. We're going to put our foot down. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4466.5199999999995s)]
*  We're going to stop this. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4469.5199999999995s)]
*  The timing is is is questionable because people have lost faith in Netanyahu. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4471.96s)]
*  Right. You know, his government was potentially about to dissolve. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4478.32s)]
*  We don't know. You know, he had serious issues with honestly, I bet he was going to [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4481.52s)]
*  survive. The guy's a survivor. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4486.64s)]
*  But I'm sorry. Yeah. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4488.28s)]
*  No, no, no. You're right. I mean, they call him the magician because like he like makes [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4489.92s)]
*  finds himself in these. Yeah. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4493.68s)]
*  So I get the skepticism. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4495.52s)]
*  And this is this is a thing that Israelis talk about, which is like, you know, you [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4497.32s)]
*  talked about the exhaustion. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4501.360000000001s)]
*  There's also this frustration with the leadership. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4503.28s)]
*  And I will say this, I don't think I think we can get to peace. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4505.72s)]
*  And I think that this ends hopefully in a way where [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4510.6s)]
*  we have a path to no more enrichment in [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4516.4800000000005s)]
*  Iran, that they're going to pull back from the terror army, you know, work, all [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4521.76s)]
*  that stuff. I do believe and I think most people believe that you're going to need a [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4527.92s)]
*  new regime. Like it's not going to be this this regime and you're going to need a [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4534.72s)]
*  new coalition government. It's not going to be this coalition government in Israel. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4539.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, with Ben Gavir and Schmaltridge, like it's not going to happen. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4542.88s)]
*  I think you're getting something really important, which this this just isn't about [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4545.76s)]
*  WMDs. This is a regime change operation. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4548.92s)]
*  We know that Donald Trump vetoed a plan from Netanyahu to assassinate the supreme [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4551.360000000001s)]
*  leader of Iran. And I think if you look at the recent couple of decades of regime [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4557.52s)]
*  change wars, Iraq, Libya, Syria was a catastrophe for 15 years. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4562.44s)]
*  I see the same kind of neocon voices arguing, oh, it'd be clean and simple. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4568.679999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, like flowers will bloom across the Middle East. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4573.5599999999995s)]
*  And I just I find that very hard to believe. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4576.16s)]
*  And I also like I see Trump saying, OK, you know, we're going to bomb them and then [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4578.28s)]
*  that'll force the Iranians to cut a deal. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4582.12s)]
*  But if you're the supreme leader, like this isn't just about your nuclear program. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4585.919999999999s)]
*  This is about your survival. This is about regime survival. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4589.32s)]
*  And how can they trust us to implement a deal? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4592.44s)]
*  You know, like either Trump was too weak to keep Bibi from bombing in the middle of [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4594.96s)]
*  his diplomatic efforts or those diplomatic efforts were insincere. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4598.44s)]
*  Trump pulled out of the JCPOA. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4602.919999999999s)]
*  Iran has been burned by the US, you know, sort of in these hostage deals that the [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4605.44s)]
*  Biden cooked up. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4610.0s)]
*  Trump posted a message this morning about how he could kill the supreme leader at [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4612.599999999999s)]
*  any time. So like I just it's very hard for me to like, you know, I agree with you. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4616.16s)]
*  You have to put yourself in the in the in the shoes of the people most vulnerable. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4621.32s)]
*  I think we also have to try to put ourselves in Iran's shoes sometime and [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4624.84s)]
*  understand where they're coming from and that innocent civilians are dying there [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4627.84s)]
*  and that, you know, a regime change operation is very unlikely to lead to a [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4631.8s)]
*  government that is more friendly to Israel, in my opinion. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4637.2s)]
*  I think you're more likely to see the guys with the guns like the RGC and others [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4641.0s)]
*  in control. We don't know. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4645.92s)]
*  I mean, you know, look, I the regime change, the way in which you described it is [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4647.96s)]
*  boots on the ground. No one's talking about putting boots on the ground. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4652.92s)]
*  I mean, we're not invading Iran. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4655.400000000001s)]
*  No one's invading Iran. I mean, this they have invaded the airspace. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4656.96s)]
*  They've taken over the airspace. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4659.88s)]
*  But this is this is different than, you know, what we saw in Iraq or Afghanistan. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4661.04s)]
*  And although we don't know where this is going, but I wouldn't I would navigate for, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4667.68s)]
*  you know, the troops on the ground or, you know, or anything like we saw in [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4672.4400000000005s)]
*  in those wars that you mentioned. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4677.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's, you know, regime change is very difficult in in Israel, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4681.24s)]
*  to be clear, which is a democracy. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4686.68s)]
*  There's going to be an election next year. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4688.92s)]
*  So whether, you know, his coalition and for those who you don't [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4692.36s)]
*  don't know this, to be prime minister, you need 61 members of the Knesset [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4697.5599999999995s)]
*  to join your to join your coalition. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4701.96s)]
*  I think I think Netanyahu is at 68, 69. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4705.0s)]
*  Maybe it's something, you know, it's something like that. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4709.04s)]
*  You know, he could lose, you know, eight or nine people. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4711.24s)]
*  And then that immediately leads to a new election. Right. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4713.84s)]
*  But next year, there will be an election in any in any event. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4717.32s)]
*  And so you're going to have presumably new leadership, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4720.5599999999995s)]
*  a new government in Israel. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4724.92s)]
*  Iran, obviously not a democracy, a theocracy. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4728.0s)]
*  You know, this crew took over in 1979. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4731.5199999999995s)]
*  And it is entirely possible to imagine a scenario where [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4734.719999999999s)]
*  because of how weakened they've been, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4739.599999999999s)]
*  that, you know, there is a domestic, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4744.759999999999s)]
*  you know, uprising and there's going to be a change, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4750.679999999999s)]
*  you know, because they don't want to continue to live like this. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4754.32s)]
*  But, you know, I do think that. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4757.4s)]
*  The the actions while unsettling and and frustrating for some. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4760.5199999999995s)]
*  And and and and and also like Israel is targeting military [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4766.5199999999995s)]
*  and oil and gas infrastructure. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4772.36s)]
*  And they're hitting in urban areas in the same way that Iran is like [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4774.0s)]
*  targeting the Israeli M.O.D., which is in Tel Aviv and hitting urban areas. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4777.12s)]
*  Like the same thing is happening right now. Right. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4781.36s)]
*  So the IDF is targeting very specific [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4784.12s)]
*  very specific strategic, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4788.72s)]
*  you know, whether it's oil and gas or or or it's the, you know, the weapons, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4792.2s)]
*  you know, stockpiles, whatever it is. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4797.360000000001s)]
*  They're not indiscriminately lobbying missiles into Tel Aviv or into into Jerusalem. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4799.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, Iran is just yes, Iran has focused some [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4806.12s)]
*  of their missiles on military targets, but it is indiscriminate. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4811.64s)]
*  I mean, think about what happened in April last year. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4815.68s)]
*  I mean, two, three hundred, you know, objects in the air, killer drones, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4817.68s)]
*  you know, missiles that was indiscriminate. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4822.92s)]
*  All civilians or mostly civilians. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4826.360000000001s)]
*  Right. So it is different. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4829.52s)]
*  Well, no one was killed. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4830.84s)]
*  I mean, like 10x more people have been killed in Iran than have been killed in Israel. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4831.84s)]
*  Look, I hear what you're saying. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4836.64s)]
*  You're making a point that I agree with and I think is in some sense is valid. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4837.88s)]
*  I don't I don't know what exactly each side is targeting. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4840.64s)]
*  I agree with you that you're seeing like apartment buildings in Tel Aviv getting hit [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4844.36s)]
*  and there's just no discernible military value there. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4848.639999999999s)]
*  And that is clearly a war crime and unacceptable. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4850.599999999999s)]
*  We're also seeing reports that the IDF in their early decapitation [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4853.16s)]
*  targets were going after senior military leaders in these buildings [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4857.799999999999s)]
*  that flattened the whole thing. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4862.08s)]
*  So I don't know who else was in the building and what civilians have been killed. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4863.04s)]
*  There were some early images of like a little girl who had been killed. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4866.28s)]
*  So the war is horrific, right? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4868.639999999999s)]
*  Like horrible things are happening because of this conflict. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4870.48s)]
*  Well, let's let's let's get to Gaza because in the days after October 7th, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4873.04s)]
*  obviously, Israel had to respond militarily. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4877.16s)]
*  There were hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4880.12s)]
*  Twelve hundred people have been murdered. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4883.4s)]
*  There were hundreds of hostages sitting in Gaza. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4884.72s)]
*  There was literally ongoing rocket fire. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4888.12s)]
*  Right. The idea that that Israel would not respond militarily to that is insane. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4890.2s)]
*  20 months later, I just cannot understand any argument for continuing this war, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4895.16s)]
*  because in my view, Hamas is decimated. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4899.44s)]
*  There's absolutely no chance they could pull off another October 7th. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4903.0s)]
*  And frankly, like I think it should have been prevented in the first place. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4907.44s)]
*  The idea of had the plan right, like Netanyahu took his eye off the ball. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4913.2s)]
*  He had IDF troops off the border and up in the West Bank [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4916.04s)]
*  dealing with settler violence. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4919.28s)]
*  The Israeli senior Israeli officials like Yoav Galant, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4921.44s)]
*  I know you know extremely well, the former defense minister [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4924.839999999999s)]
*  has told hostage families, quote, There's nothing left in Gaza to do. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4927.76s)]
*  The major achievement has been achieved. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4931.64s)]
*  I fear we are staying there just because there are desire to be there. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4933.4s)]
*  Ehud Elmer, the former Israeli prime minister, said the government of Israel [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4936.36s)]
*  is currently waging a war without purpose, without goals or clear planning [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4939.96s)]
*  and with no chances of success. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4943.88s)]
*  Even Steve Wichoff, Trump's emissary to the region, said, quote, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4945.72s)]
*  Israel is prolonging the war, even though we do not see where further progress [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4948.68s)]
*  can be made. And then, you know, to civilian casualties. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4952.68s)]
*  I mean, the death toll in Gaza is staggering. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4955.28s)]
*  The reports are fifty five thousand Palestinians dead. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4957.24s)]
*  I personally believe that is likely to be a severe undercount. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4959.84s)]
*  Ninety percent of housing units are destroyed or damaged. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4962.92s)]
*  Twenty two percent of the population faces catastrophic levels of food [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4965.719999999999s)]
*  insecurity. Top Israeli government ministers are calling for [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4969.5599999999995s)]
*  the ethnic cleansing of the Gaza Strip. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4973.36s)]
*  So I just I hear you like, yes, Hamas is not a partner for peace, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4975.48s)]
*  but they are an idea and a political organization [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4980.92s)]
*  organization as well in a group that sort of like exists to resist [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4983.96s)]
*  and to try to kill Israel. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4989.96s)]
*  I don't think we can eradicate all of Hamas through this war. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4991.8s)]
*  And I don't understand the argument for continuing it at this point. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4996.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I, as I said, I was able to and I tried [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=4999.84s)]
*  because I'm in the position I am, I, you know, I try to do all my sort [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5005.160000000001s)]
*  of complaining and arguing directly with folks. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5009.0s)]
*  And so, you know, and I've built up trust to where I can go and sit [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5011.84s)]
*  in a room with Netanyahu and say, like, like the humanitarian aid situation [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5015.08s)]
*  isn't at all where it needs to be. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5019.36s)]
*  Like you got to search humanitarian aid. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5021.04s)]
*  You got to, you know, and this is something that Galaan pushed for, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5023.0s)]
*  you know, a long time ago, which was what we're seeing now, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5026.32s)]
*  which is essentially these humanitarian bubbles, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5029.52s)]
*  you know, because of the technology that that Israel has, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5033.52s)]
*  what they found in the tunnels. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5037.2s)]
*  They're they can separate Hamas from the Gazans, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5038.6s)]
*  facial recognition, all kinds of stuff, and create these places [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5043.200000000001s)]
*  where Gazans are completely safe and and they're getting food [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5046.320000000001s)]
*  and and medicine and everything that they need. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5051.320000000001s)]
*  And how that is, you know, not just the Jewish thing to do, [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5054.120000000001s)]
*  not just the right thing to do. I'm Jewish. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5057.240000000001s)]
*  And not just the right thing to do, it's also the strategic thing to do. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5059.72s)]
*  Separating Hamas from Gaza, Gazans, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5062.400000000001s)]
*  is is a strategic imperative because then you can, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5065.88s)]
*  you know, further, you know, just this dismantle or disarm, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5069.84s)]
*  demilitarize the rest of of Gaza. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5075.4s)]
*  I think. Ending this war, getting the hostages home is the priority. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5080.599999999999s)]
*  I am with Galant and others that you got to get that deal done. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5085.84s)]
*  And I'm also with Galant that I wish that deal done. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5089.88s)]
*  And this is where I'm going to. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5093.72s)]
*  I wish that deal got done a long time ago [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5095.04s)]
*  for a lot of people's sake, including. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5098.76s)]
*  Just for a lot of people's sake. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5103.88s)]
*  And, you know, Netanyahu's argument was, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5106.84s)]
*  you know, we have to secure the southern border along Egypt [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5111.08s)]
*  because that's where Hamas is continuing to get arms and the Philadelphia corridor. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5114.92s)]
*  And and and there are some truth to that. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5120.04s)]
*  But Galant would make the argument you can go back in pretty quickly. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5122.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, it's harder, but you got to get everyone home. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5126.12s)]
*  I I I don't know what to say other than yes, I agree. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5129.5599999999995s)]
*  However. The the issue of Hamas still has to be addressed. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5135.08s)]
*  Let's say that Netanyahu gets an agreement [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5140.24s)]
*  and they end the war tomorrow and all of the hostages come home. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5144.04s)]
*  There is still a big question about what you do with Hamas. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5149.2s)]
*  And yes, Hamas can't do another October 7th. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5152.5199999999995s)]
*  But that's not the only goal here. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5156.04s)]
*  I mean, Hamas, in part, you're thinking I'm thinking about the Palestinians. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5159.5199999999995s)]
*  Like they need a legitimate governing authority that allows them to leverage, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5164.719999999999s)]
*  you know, all of these resources that I think are going to be brought to the table [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5170.36s)]
*  from the Saudis and others to rebuild. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5173.679999999999s)]
*  You want to rebuild with a new governing authority, not with Hamas. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5177.44s)]
*  And so there there is a legitimate strategic question of what does [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5181.679999999999s)]
*  Israel and everyone else do with Hamas because we can't go back. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5185.879999999999s)]
*  You can't go back. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5190.4s)]
*  You can't, you know, have all of this awfulness happen [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5191.5599999999995s)]
*  and then go back to what was happening pre October 7th. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5194.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, one, you're not going to have long term stability. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5199.719999999999s)]
*  You're not going to get to peace to the Palestinians in Gaza are going to have [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5202.96s)]
*  what another 15 years of awfulness. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5206.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you and you can't go back. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5209.8s)]
*  But like then there's that's [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5212.12s)]
*  you also have to face the reality that Netanyahu has pissed away 20 months [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5215.44s)]
*  without thinking about the day after. Right. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5218.679999999999s)]
*  Like there's no there's been no effort to create or empower a political entity [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5220.28s)]
*  that can be representative of the Palestinian people, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5225.4s)]
*  whether they're in Gaza or the West Bank or anywhere, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5228.48s)]
*  and can serve as that representative and kind of like take the mantle. Right. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5230.96s)]
*  And so this we can't go back kind of [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5235.8s)]
*  argument, which I totally understand, I empathize with [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5240.240000000001s)]
*  and I hear on some level is being used to justify like endless [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5243.360000000001s)]
*  wheel spinning and pointless war and just like the slaughter of Palestinian people. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5248.6s)]
*  And I fear that that is fueling anti-Semitism around the world. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5253.160000000001s)]
*  Like there there is a hard to quantify like moral damage [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5257.4800000000005s)]
*  that happens to any country, whether it was the US [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5261.759999999999s)]
*  in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Israelis with this war in Gaza, when you're kind of like [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5265.36s)]
*  a part of this something so awful and cruel happening. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5269.679999999999s)]
*  And like, what's the end game then? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5274.48s)]
*  Like, how can we as Americans help push to end this? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5276.28s)]
*  Because in my book, I feel like I'm a taxpayer. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5280.04s)]
*  I don't want any more of my tax dollars going towards this war. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5282.28s)]
*  I don't know why we're shipping two thousand pound bombs to Netanyahu to use in Gaza. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5286.08s)]
*  Right. But like, it seems like there's a real reticence to use any of that kind of leverage. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5290.72s)]
*  Well, a couple of things. One is in order to to, [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5294.76s)]
*  you know, be done with Hamas, the the tunnel system does have to be, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5299.04s)]
*  you know, destroyed, not entirely. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5304.280000000001s)]
*  That would be impossible. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5306.84s)]
*  But, you know, part of what you're seeing is the destruction of infrastructure. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5308.2s)]
*  And it looks terrible. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5314.08s)]
*  And and I get how bad this war has been. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5315.320000000001s)]
*  But not but period. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5319.92s)]
*  A lot of it is infrastructure that the IDF believes has to be destroyed [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5322.84s)]
*  in order to limit what Hamas is able to do [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5328.56s)]
*  and and get to a point where Hamas is so weakened that they are willing [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5334.4400000000005s)]
*  to accept a deal on the Jordanians, the Egyptians. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5339.24s)]
*  Their frustration is that there were so many deals [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5341.84s)]
*  and so many opportunities. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5345.72s)]
*  And Hamas, you know, said, no, we're not that, you know, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5347.04s)]
*  we're not going to give these last remaining hostages up. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5351.84s)]
*  And that is a frustrating position to be in. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5356.0s)]
*  And I and I do I I do get frustrated that while there is [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5360.04s)]
*  plenty of when you're at war, there's plenty of of of awfulness [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5366.56s)]
*  to be talked about and and and and people should sit in it and feel it on both sides. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5371.0s)]
*  And I have I mean, I can't get images of October 7th out of my head. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5376.44s)]
*  I never will. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5380.839999999999s)]
*  I, you know, I've seen, you know, hours of footage [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5381.879999999999s)]
*  and I can't get images of what has happened and goes out of my head. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5385.879999999999s)]
*  I never will. I don't want to because I want to be I want to be somebody [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5390.12s)]
*  who's there at some point as part of the solution that is there, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5393.96s)]
*  you know, working through a sustainable piece that's building it all back. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5398.36s)]
*  You can't fight a war anywhere and not make mistakes. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5402.04s)]
*  And and and some of them have been awful mistakes. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5405.12s)]
*  Why it is so frustrating that the that the international outrage [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5409.88s)]
*  for Hamas just has not didn't didn't last longer than, you know, 24, 48 hours. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5415.4800000000005s)]
*  And the same with Iran. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5421.2s)]
*  Like, it is so clear to me that and maybe this is unfair [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5422.64s)]
*  and maybe I'm being, you know, naive. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5426.88s)]
*  But if the world would just Europe and and and and and [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5429.76s)]
*  and I think the Gulf states are closer than anyone. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5434.6s)]
*  But Europe, you know, the the the anti-Israel, [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5436.360000000001s)]
*  pro-Palestinian movement here in the United States, if they just say, look, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5441.72s)]
*  we are going to take a beat and we're going to leave Israel alone. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5444.96s)]
*  We're going to stop saying Israel is the worst. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5449.92s)]
*  And we're going to focus all of our intention or attention and outrage [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5452.08s)]
*  on this Iranian regime and Hamas and just say, look, you have to be done. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5457.320000000001s)]
*  You have to be done. You have to be done. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5462.92s)]
*  I I just don't understand what [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5464.92s)]
*  why that isn't the at least something that [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5468.56s)]
*  folks who have been saying Israel is the worst, Israel is the worst, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5474.200000000001s)]
*  Israel is the worst. Can I explain why? Yeah. Yeah. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5477.56s)]
*  Because because Hamas is a fucking terrorist organization. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5480.200000000001s)]
*  My expectations for them are rock bottom. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5483.08s)]
*  They are evil motherfuckers. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5485.68s)]
*  What they did on October 7th was evil and unjustifiable. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5487.120000000001s)]
*  And no civilian should ever be killed. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5490.4400000000005s)]
*  But I but I just think we all have to live in like kind of [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5492.24s)]
*  look at the recent history, which is that the only way we're going to get [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5495.639999999999s)]
*  these hostages out is through a negotiated ceasefire. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5497.92s)]
*  That's going to be imperfect, just like the Iran deal was imperfect. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5502.639999999999s)]
*  Like not everyone's always going to get what they want out of these deals. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5504.84s)]
*  And like that's diplomacy. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5507.599999999999s)]
*  But I think part of what you're seeing about the reaction in Yahoo! [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5509.0s)]
*  is he's a fucking liar. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5512.16s)]
*  Like we played earlier in the show [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5513.8s)]
*  audio of Netanyahu testifying before Congress in what? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5516.8s)]
*  2002, 2003, about what a cakewalk the Iraq war would be about Saddam's W and D's lie. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5520.48s)]
*  I watched him lie to Obama's face during the Obama administration. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5526.04s)]
*  He's a fucking liar. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5529.959999999999s)]
*  And I think a lot of my frustration with like the Biden administration's [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5531.679999999999s)]
*  Israel policy was the sense you always got from him because he said it all the time [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5535.32s)]
*  was that he still thought we were living in gold of my years Israel. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5539.16s)]
*  And it was this like bygone era of a liberal, democratic, progressive Israel. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5542.599999999999s)]
*  But Israel under Netanyahu was very different. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5547.16s)]
*  And there's literal extremist terrorist sympathizers in his cabinet. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5549.36s)]
*  Like it's Mark Ben-Gavir had a photo of a mass murderer of Palestinians on his wall. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5553.5199999999995s)]
*  And I just think like U.S. policy is just not adjusted. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5558.96s)]
*  Right. So I think. Well, that I agree with. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5562.04s)]
*  Hold on. That I agree with. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5563.92s)]
*  U.S. policy has not adjusted. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5565.36s)]
*  And and and and I think that. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5566.96s)]
*  The understanding how the coalition government works is is so hugely important [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5571.32s)]
*  for American politicians and American, you know, policymakers. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5577.68s)]
*  He needs 61 votes. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5582.400000000001s)]
*  And and and and and he decided in part he claims and I agree, he [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5584.4800000000005s)]
*  he is a he's a difficult guy to trust. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5591.360000000001s)]
*  So diplomatic. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5595.52s)]
*  But he says that, you know, he tried to go in a different direction. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5598.12s)]
*  And folks on the left said no. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5602.0s)]
*  And so he ended up with, you know, a coalition that included Ben-Gavir [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5604.0s)]
*  and Smoltzridge, and it's absurd. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5607.76s)]
*  Those people should be out of his government. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5609.72s)]
*  And he has a sureness over and over. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5611.64s)]
*  Oh, no, they don't. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5613.12s)]
*  They talk a lot. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5615.0s)]
*  But but I run the show. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5616.6s)]
*  They're not running the government. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5618.32s)]
*  And I've pointed out instances to him like, no, nobody. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5619.56s)]
*  There are there are moments where they they seem to have the wheel. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5622.64s)]
*  Yeah. In terms of, you know, what they do with the police and, you know, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5625.64s)]
*  moving money around because, you know, one of the guys is in charge of the money [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5628.92s)]
*  and why money isn't going into the West Bank, into the Palestinian authority. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5632.2s)]
*  Oh, we're taking care of that. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5636.36s)]
*  I mean, all those things. Right. Right. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5637.4s)]
*  But our folks have to appreciate that. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5639.32s)]
*  Every time you come in hard on Netanyahu, you know, he he [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5643.2s)]
*  his coalition sort of strengthens around him. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5648.04s)]
*  And so it isn't so clear. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5650.96s)]
*  It isn't so like, oh, let's just I'm going to go and I'm going to be tough with BB [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5652.36s)]
*  because like you can do some of that stuff behind the scenes. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5656.48s)]
*  Some of that stuff, if you play out publicly, it only strengthens [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5658.96s)]
*  strengthens the guy. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5662.6s)]
*  It only helps that the the existing coalition. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5663.52s)]
*  If you start to, you know, play the politics [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5667.0s)]
*  and understand the Knesset and figure out how to get a deal done [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5670.28s)]
*  where he can expand his coalition or change or shift his coalition, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5672.8s)]
*  I think you could get to a place where [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5677.72s)]
*  he has a fundamentally different governing coalition [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5681.68s)]
*  that that that does not include Ben Gavir and Smoltridge. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5685.72s)]
*  Yeah. Look, I think you you make a lot of good points. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5689.12s)]
*  I think you're right in your analysis. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5692.24s)]
*  But I think at the end of the day, Netanyahu is not committed to a two state solution. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5694.24s)]
*  He's not committed to peace. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5697.04s)]
*  He's never like delivered on any of the things people hoped he would. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5698.04s)]
*  So I think like kind of fish rots from the head down is my take on this one. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5700.84s)]
*  I mean, listen, I he he is very I mean, the politics in Israel [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5705.84s)]
*  are so complicated, as you know, the number one issue is security. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5710.52s)]
*  It's it's just like the you know, you go to America anywhere in America. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5713.76s)]
*  The number one issue is is is the economy and then it's border and it's public safety. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5717.28s)]
*  And it's you know, people care about climate and people care about this. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5721.24s)]
*  And Israel, everyone, it's security, security, security. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5723.92s)]
*  And so whether it's him or somebody else, the situation remains very complicated. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5726.639999999999s)]
*  So even if it's not Netanyahu, whoever comes in next [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5731.8s)]
*  is going to have a difficult task. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5736.4s)]
*  Now, I would get the war done. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5738.5599999999995s)]
*  I would search humanitarian aid. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5740.16s)]
*  I would build the biggest coalition ever for peace. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5742.12s)]
*  I do believe that if he had the politics on his side, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5744.88s)]
*  Netanyahu would 100 percent say, yes, we're going to put ourselves on a path [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5748.88s)]
*  to getting to I think what they're comfortable with at the moment [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5754.280000000001s)]
*  is Palestinian self-determination or self-governance, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5759.0s)]
*  because there is a every every day you get from October 7th. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5763.200000000001s)]
*  It's it's easier to say, OK, we can head in that direction. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5768.080000000001s)]
*  But if October 7th was this awful terror attacked, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5772.04s)]
*  you know, and the reward is a Palestinian state, that that is a that is a challenge [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5777.0s)]
*  for a lot of Israelis who say, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5781.72s)]
*  I'm all for peace and I'm all for getting to that at some point. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5784.2s)]
*  But why are we talking about that now? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5789.2s)]
*  I totally understand that. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5791.24s)]
*  I I and that's the damage, right? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5792.56s)]
*  Like October 7th is going to reverberate for years, if not decades, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5795.24s)]
*  if not generations. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5800.28s)]
*  And I hope that the exact kind of feeling you're describing, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5801.36s)]
*  which is totally understandable, which is we can't let this horrific, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5805.5599999999995s)]
*  evil and justifiable terrorist attack feel rewarded. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5809.04s)]
*  I just hope that that doesn't, you know, block a pathway to peace in perpetuity. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5813.84s)]
*  I want and this is, you know, here in the United States, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5818.36s)]
*  because I'm a 90s kid, so I grew up in the 90s. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5823.2s)]
*  I remember I remember getting excited about politics, in part [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5825.4s)]
*  because I saw the Rose Garden ceremony where Clinton was, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5828.64s)]
*  you know, shaking hands with Arafat and Rabin, a prime minister of Israel, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5831.76s)]
*  head of the PLO, and how close they got to peace. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5836.72s)]
*  And I want I want to see [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5840.8s)]
*  that kind of leadership here in the Middle East, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5846.0s)]
*  people who can step out onto the world stage [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5850.160000000001s)]
*  and bring people together around something bigger [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5853.12s)]
*  than, you know, what we what we have now. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5857.92s)]
*  And, you know, I've pushed the prime minister to be that kind of leader, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5861.639999999999s)]
*  even, you know, likening, you know, what has to happen to what Zelensky has, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5867.32s)]
*  which is like rallying the world around your cause. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5872.04s)]
*  And I want to see that for Israel. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5875.92s)]
*  I want to see that for the Palestinians. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5878.88s)]
*  I want to see that for us. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5880.679999999999s)]
*  And I hope we get to a point where the situation in Iran [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5883.04s)]
*  gets resolved, where the conflict ends very quickly, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5888.72s)]
*  that hopefully there is a diplomatic path, that it was sort of, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5893.44s)]
*  you know, helped along by the awfulness of the last couple of days [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5897.68s)]
*  because they do respond. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5902.36s)]
*  They do respond to this kind of [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5904.16s)]
*  attack, these kinds of attacks. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5909.44s)]
*  They they they they are worried. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5912.64s)]
*  They don't want war in the end. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5914.68s)]
*  The Iranian regime, they don't want war. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5916.64s)]
*  They want to stay in power. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5918.28s)]
*  And so maybe this is enough. I hope it is. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5919.400000000001s)]
*  I hope it's enough for them to say, you know what, let's let's get it. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5921.52s)]
*  Let's get a deal done. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5924.4400000000005s)]
*  And I hope we get to a point where the Israelis have the kind of, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5925.96s)]
*  you know, leadership that can step out into the world stage [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5930.12s)]
*  and bring the world together and and not just for Israel, but [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5933.24s)]
*  but for Palestinians and everyone in the region. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5938.16s)]
*  I think that's a great place to end it. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5940.36s)]
*  I hope that the most optimistic version of whatever the hell both of us said [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5942.04s)]
*  throughout the course of this 45 minute conversation is what comes true. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5946.88s)]

*  The Knicks can't even hire a coach to. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvsIjcxh4U&t=5979.76s)]
