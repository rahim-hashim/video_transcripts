Video Description: Tommy and Ben discuss the fallout from Trump's national security team accidentally sending top secret war plans to a journalist, Turkey's backsliding democracy as a result of Erdoğan arresting his top political opponent, and Bibi Netanyahu's continuing efforts to remove internal critics while Israel gears up for potential annexation of Gaza. They also discuss a violent settler attack on the Oscar winning co-director of No Other Land, Russia's maximalist terms for the new maritime ceasefire with Ukraine, the conflicts in Sudan and Congo, and the Trump administration's latest immigration moves, including revoking temporary protected status for over 500,000 people. Then, Tommy is joined by Jeremy Shapiro, Research Director at the European Council of Foreign Relations, for a tour of Europe, including Turkey's political unrest, Romania's fraught election, and the latest with Hungarian strongman Viktor Orbán.

*  He did an hour and a half long interview with Tucker Carlson where he talked about a whole range of stuff [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=74.2s)]

*  We covered a lot of ground pretty quickly. We could have a pot save Europe Tommy. I'm just saying [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=126.28s)]
*  I think we could speaking of fun Ben. We have to cover a lot of dark shit on this show [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=130.56s)]

*  But Jeff dropped this blockbuster story on us [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  Somehow Mike waltz Trump's national security adviser looped Jeffrey Goldberg in on a group chat on a signal for those who don't know [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=149.12s)]

*  The group that Jeff got added to was called Houthi PC small group the Houthis [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=167.52s)]
*  Even the name is so funny the Houthis are referring to the Houthi rebels [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=173.36s)]
*  An extremist group based in Yemen that the US has been bombing for years because they were firing missiles and drones at ships in [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=176.88000000000002s)]

*  PC stands for principals committee, which is a meeting hosted by the National Security Advisor [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=183.24s)]
*  That includes the literally the top national security officials in the US government the head of the FBI for example [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=188.24s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense the National Security Advisor the Secretary of State and small group is what you call a White House situation [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=194.92s)]
*  Room meeting when the subject is sensitive and you want to limit the number of people involved and disinvite some people that you find annoying [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  so [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=209.88s)]
*  Jeff gets looped onto this group chat [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=211.2s)]
*  And all of a sudden he's just seeing messages from Mike waltz JD Vance [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=213.51999999999998s)]

*  They're making a policy decision. Here's Jeff Goldberg describing for Jen Psaki [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  What exactly was discussed on this group chat? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  This comes after they made the policy decision and they were talking about execution of this bombing rate the specific time of a future attack [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=242.06s)]
*  Specific targets including human targets [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=251.11999999999998s)]

*  even even [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=260.28s)]
*  Weather reports so you know that the government is I don't know why Hexup was sharing it with everybody [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=261.52s)]
*  I mean the precise detail and then and then a long [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=267.06s)]
*  Section on sequencing this is gonna happen then that is gonna happen after that happens this happens [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=271.84s)]
*  Then that happens and then we go and find out if it worked. I mean [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=277.34s)]
*  you know, he can say that it wasn't a war plan, but [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=281.76s)]
*  It was a it was a [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=286.97999999999996s)]
*  minute by minute [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=290.06s)]
*  Accounting of what was about to happen. Sounds pretty classified to me Ben for what it's worth and it's not worth much [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=291.82s)]
*  Here's Pete Hegsath denying the allegations and blaming it all on Jeff Goldberg during a brief press availability in Hawaii [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=298.97999999999996s)]
*  You're talking about a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=307.5s)]
*  Deceitful and highly discredited [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=310.41999999999996s)]
*  so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again to include the I don't know the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=313.02s)]
*  hoaxes of Russia Russia Russia or the fine people on both sides hoax or suckers and losers hoax [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=321.17999999999995s)]
*  So this is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does. I've heard I've heard I was characterized [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=328.38s)]
*  Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=335.06s)]
*  He like literally is speaking an alternate right-wing language [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=339.94s)]
*  So Ben Trump's top intelligence officials also parroted a lot of these lines are played dumb at a congressional hearing today [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=343.06s)]
*  Several reporters have since pointed out after Jeff's story posted that Steve Whitcoff was in Moscow as he was receiving [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=349.34s)]
*  Many of these signal messages. So Ben we should just say for the record PC meetings are [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=356.17999999999995s)]
*  Always in the White House Situation Room because they're almost always highly classified you can join remotely but only via [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=361.84s)]
*  secure government video technology [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=368.88s)]
*  There was clearly classified information discussed on this chain like any [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=372.24s)]
*  prospective military action is like de facto classified and pretending otherwise is nonsense and [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=376.44s)]
*  Whitcoff yucking it up from Moscow is like jaw-droppingly stupid [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=382.0s)]
*  The knives are now out for Mike Waltz a person close to the White House told political quote [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=385.6s)]
*  Everyone in the White House can agree on one thing Mike Waltz is a fucking idiot Ben your reaction to this disaster [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=389.8s)]
*  I mean, it's it's such a wide-ranging disaster. It's hard to find one entry point [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=396.62s)]
*  I was in probably hundreds of PCs and small groups and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=401.91999999999996s)]
*  Just to give people a sense of how tight the security is [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  When I was traveling, I remember one time for instance, I was traveling in Oregon [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=412.02s)]
*  I was on like a family vacation and I had to join a PC [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=415.34s)]
*  I had to drive an hour and a half to an FBI field office to be escorted in a room with a secure video [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  Connection in the Situation Room and I didn't think twice about that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=425.34s)]
*  Like the idea that I just be on my phone [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=429.5s)]
*  Crazy nuts. So the first point is that this is not normal [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=432.06s)]
*  Like this is not something that anybody else has ever done. This is fucking insane. That's the first point. The second point is [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=436.62s)]
*  You know just adding Jeff Goldberg is one of the dumbest fucking things [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=443.86s)]
*  I've ever heard of in my life and Mike Waltz should be fired [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean if there's not accountability for I mean because what if he added, you know, if he's just like searching geez [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  What if he added, you know, like I don't know it could be anybody right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=456.7s)]
*  Like he doesn't know who he added that guy wasn't an H name if he added an actual Huthi [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=460.72s)]
*  In there, I mean the things like Jeff is like a very like inside the right, you know beltway guy [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=466.14s)]
*  Like he was gonna be very cautious about this and and they're attacking him [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=472.14s)]
*  He didn't do anything other than receive their signal texts [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=476.62s)]
*  Like so that's the second point is like the dumb fuckery of adding Jeff Goldberg to it then [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=479.46s)]
*  the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  the fact that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=486.21999999999997s)]
*  And we can get into time we should get into kind of what we learned about the various characters and the role they're playing [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  Especially JD Vance. Yeah, exactly. But the fact that that Pete Hegseth [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=493.38s)]
*  Texted these war plans and Jeff was very specific [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=497.9s)]
*  He had these are what are called so for people who wanted to come to Potsis Wilford jargon strike packages, right? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=500.78s)]
*  This would only be on high side email would never be on unclassified email [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=507.34s)]
*  It'd be on you had been a special computer to read it and it would have things like what time we're gonna hit [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=511.18s)]
*  What you know military we're gonna use to hit, you know from this aircraft carrier or these cruise missiles or these planes [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=517.14s)]
*  What targets were hitting it's it's a war plan whatever the fuck Pete Hegseth says it lays it all out [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=523.98s)]
*  Why he needed to text that on signal is insane to me [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=530.1s)]
*  I mean just send the thing on high side email and by the way [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=534.74s)]
*  even if you're gonna be dumb enough to be on signal just say like I sent I sent the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=538.22s)]
*  Information on high side if he actually put any of this information in the signal chat [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=543.06s)]
*  To me what that suggests is a degree of reckless incompetence and that's that's I think we have to keep repeating [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=547.1s)]
*  This is reckless incompetence, but even worse for Hegseth [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=552.78s)]
*  I think it was probably him like showing off for his buddies like hey, man [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=555.5s)]
*  Look at the strike package like this is the time we're gonna hit the Houthis. I also have questions. Was he drunk? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=559.5799999999999s)]
*  I'm actually serious about this like like we know what do we know about what how did this information get on his phone? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=565.9399999999999s)]
*  Did you think about this Tommy like if it was on a high side email? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=572.86s)]
*  Did he have someone move it to unclassified email so he could cut and paste it? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=576.74s)]
*  Did he take a picture of it and send it to his buddies like there are all kinds of questions about the Hegseth role in this [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=581.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting as long as we're doing jargon [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=586.1s)]
*  I wondered if they were talking about a con op which is a [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=588.1800000000001s)]
*  Military term for concept of operations that it's like kind of like a high-level [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=590.7s)]
*  Planning document that outlines how a military mission is going to be executed and again [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=594.3000000000001s)]
*  Like you said like this is something very classified that you would get from the Joint Staff [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=598.64s)]
*  It does sound like John Ratcliffe today at the hearing was saying that when he got to the CIA that you know for the first [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=602.46s)]
*  Day of the job he he had [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=608.1800000000001s)]
*  Signal installed on his unclassified computer and just so folks know I mean when Ben and I were in the White House [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=611.58s)]
*  We had three computers. We had an unclassified computer and then there was a computer on the military's network [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=617.34s)]
*  Which was basically a secret level and then there was a top secret computer now [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=624.0600000000001s)]
*  I have no idea what the tech and the infrastructure looks like these days and I know that the CIA [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=627.94s)]
*  Even back then had its own kind of internal mail system [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=634.02s)]
*  So I guess you can imagine a scenario where like top leaders at the Pentagon [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=637.4599999999999s)]
*  Have some kind of unclassed system that has signal on it. But again to your point like clearly they were [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=642.2199999999999s)]
*  Transferring stuff from the classified side to this unclassified system and then sending it on signal, which is a massive [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=650.02s)]
*  No, no, it was very funny then you notice how HECSF kept saying in the chat itself things [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=657.3399999999999s)]
*  We are currently clean on OPSEC meaning operational security as these texts are just rolling into Jeff Goldberg's [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=663.36s)]
*  Laptop and into Steve Witkoff's phone over in Moscow. It's like what are you talking about Pete? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=670.48s)]
*  Well, that's the thing is the US taxpayer pays a lot of money to make sure that we have encrypted communication systems [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=676.0s)]
*  So you don't need to use signal. The only reason you signal is so that you can like go out and be out of the office [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=683.76s)]
*  It's purely, you know, these are guys that just don't want to actually be at fucking work to do their jobs [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=690.2s)]
*  To your point about I mean moving from the HECSF of it all if Steve Witkoff was on this [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=696.64s)]
*  text thread from Moscow [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=702.32s)]
*  that's mind-blowing mind-blowing because [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=704.64s)]
*  If you if you traveled even back in the relatively peaceful Obama years to a place like Russia or China [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=707.6s)]
*  You weren't even supposed to bring your phone [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=714.6s)]
*  Like we had to leave our phones on Air Force One in China [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=716.72s)]
*  We had to leave them on the on the plane in France [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=720.64s)]
*  Yeah, they give you burner phones like this is this is like so if Steve Witkoff carried this phone [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=723.12s)]
*  Around Russia with him and was on this thread [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=730.12s)]
*  There it doesn't matter the signal encryption. They're in his phone. Anyway, they can see what's on his phone [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=733.16s)]
*  they have cameras everywhere like the idea that this was not compromised in Moscow is [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=737.68s)]
*  Hard for me to believe and we know that the Russians are allies with Iran like [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=743.96s)]
*  It's far-fetched, but they could have chosen to like alert the Houthis to this right in ways that could have endangered the operation [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=750.72s)]
*  Endangered our US troops. I don't you know, they clearly didn't do that [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=759.24s)]
*  But I mean these are the like the fact that this didn't run through Steve Witkoff's head [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=762.72s)]
*  maybe I shouldn't be on a [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=767.32s)]
*  sensitive text thread about [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=769.64s)]
*  Military operation while I'm in Moscow. Yeah [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=772.24s)]
*  These people are so reckless and incompetent again [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=775.3199999999999s)]
*  You don't need DIY encryption like I even when we were in the US in the government [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=778.18s)]
*  Which is like a more than a decade ago the senior military leadership would join [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=783.36s)]
*  Secure video conferences with the president of the United States from their airplanes [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=789.12s)]
*  We have amazing technology. We have secure comms [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=794.68s)]
*  You don't have to use your phone in a single chat and then it's like the other thing that was interesting was [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=797.44s)]
*  JD Vance's view and all this where he both suggested that Trump didn't really understand what he was doing but also [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=803.6s)]
*  JD's opposition to bombing the Houthis was all framed as being mad at Europe, which was just bizarre to me [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=809.64s)]
*  But I wonder what you made of that piece of it [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=816.48s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=817.96s)]
*  so we learned a few things so JD Vance trash talks Europe and says we're only doing this to help the Europeans which I [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=818.48s)]
*  Don't remember the Europeans like asking us to bomb the Houthis and nor do I it's the Israelis [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=823.72s)]
*  That actually have like been going after the Houthis [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=828.88s)]
*  So his you know, he tries to play smart guy like JD Vance on this signal thread sounds like he's auditioning for like a guest [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=831.42s)]
*  Role on the all-in podcast or something, you know [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=839.52s)]
*  He doesn't know what he's talking about [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=842.22s)]
*  But he any opportunity this guy gets to take a whack at Europe he takes that jumped out to me Marco Rubio [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=844.0s)]
*  Absent like we don't really hear from that guy on the text read no big ideas Stephen Miller is the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=849.92s)]
*  Domestic he's a domestic policy guy [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=856.4399999999999s)]
*  We never had the domestic policy person in in a conversation about military strikes. He got the last word [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=859.4s)]
*  He comes in SM and he's like, you know, I heard the president say he wants to X Y & Z [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=866.16s)]
*  Why is the domestic policy advisor in this conversation to begin with and then another thing that jumped out to me Tommy is that? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=871.42s)]
*  Where was it chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? Right the senior military advisor to the president [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=879.5999999999999s)]
*  Where where is the actual military officers? They totally absent from this conversation [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=884.4s)]
*  So everything about this they did trump people like this is reassuring. This is like these are smart people wrestling with hard things [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=889.8399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't be assured by that. These are morons who some of them a couple months ago were literal drunk Fox News weekend anchors [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=895.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know you and I were laughing about how we look we've been in meetings and in conversations like this where you kind of roll [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=902.2399999999999s)]
*  Your eyes at a bunch of kind of DC suits giving each other high-fives and taking credits for really [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=908.44s)]
*  Daring brave US military operations overseas and it's like hey congrats guy in the meeting you wrote a memo about it [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=915.1400000000001s)]
*  These guys were even worse. They were fucking sending emojis to each other. These are grown-ass men [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=922.2800000000001s)]
*  Sending emojis to each other. It does seem like this is really [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=928.1600000000001s)]
*  Penetrated unlike most other scandals Ben [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=932.44s)]
*  I mean Trump finally tweeted Michael waltz has learned a lesson and he's a good man [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=934.3000000000001s)]
*  He kind of got Waltz is back today at this White House event, but he really he's focusing his rage on [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=938.9200000000001s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=946.08s)]
*  And just attacking the media. It is also just worth reminding folks Ben that last week [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=947.5200000000001s)]
*  The New York Times reported that Elon Musk was planning to go over to the Pentagon to get briefed on the Pentagon's plan [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=952.2s)]
*  For war with China now [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=958.5200000000001s)]
*  They kind of I think they walked that back [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=961.2s)]
*  after this report came out, but [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=963.9200000000001s)]
*  Why do you need to brief the doge guy the government efficiency guy on the war plan with China that makes no sense in any context [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=966.56s)]
*  You're not gonna doge your way through like war with Xi Jinping [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=974.64s)]
*  But it is even crazier when you understand all of Elon Musk's conflicts with China [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=977.8s)]
*  Like he's trying to sell Tesla's to Chinese consumers half of Tesla's produced in the last couple years [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=982.14s)]
*  We're made in China his factory in China was financed with loans from Chinese banks [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=987.4799999999999s)]
*  Republican members of Congress have even called out Musk's ties with China and demanded briefings [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=992.48s)]
*  So like everything about that was weird and kind of outside of regular order and then we learn about this group chat [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=997.2s)]
*  Well, yeah to connect the dots here and I hope people keep pounding on this [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1003.28s)]
*  They should want to see the full text thread [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1007.44s)]
*  They should demand accountability and part of the reason why is it's not an isolated incident [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1010.0s)]
*  It's how these people are dealing with the most sensitive [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1015.74s)]
*  Responsibilities of government if they had a group chat about this, I'm sure they have 20 other group chats [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1019.74s)]
*  You know, I'm sure there's like a Canada invasion plan [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1025.3400000000001s)]
*  You know signal thread or or whatever the thing is and and the idea that they would brief Elon Musk on anything related to China [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1028.26s)]
*  Again, it's part of a pattern of them [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1035.58s)]
*  Bypassing any protocols that exist for a reason [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1039.54s)]
*  These aren't just like namby-pamby norm sings [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1044.1000000000001s)]
*  The idea is that like there's very sensitive information that if China and Russia get access to that information [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1046.7800000000002s)]
*  They will use it to like really screw [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1053.3200000000002s)]
*  I was I've been using a lot of profanities [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1057.14s)]
*  I'm trying to find another word [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1058.66s)]
*  but let's just say to screw the United States and [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1059.8600000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk has these massive conflicts of interest given his scale of his business interest in China given the scale of his [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1062.3000000000002s)]
*  business interests with the Pentagon, right and [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1069.8000000000002s)]
*  So giving this, you know, no pretty much private citizen access to anything at the Pentagon is insane [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1072.78s)]
*  But it's the same mentality that would lead you to [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1079.3s)]
*  Dismantle the US government that would lead you to have a signal group thread [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1082.78s)]
*  The the connective tissue here is that these people don't give a shit about Americans or American interests or American security [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1085.42s)]
*  They're just in it to either have a good time to enrich themselves to aggrandize themselves [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1092.82s)]
*  That's the common thread between all these things [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1098.22s)]
*  It was rather reckless. I heard the original group chat name was who these in the blown ship [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1100.34s)]
*  No, you can get some tomatoes or not me one other weird administration thing then so [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1105.5s)]
*  The the second lady Usha Vance is apparently going to Greenland [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1111.1399999999999s)]
*  She initially announced this trip in one of the more uncomfortable and awkward Instagram videos I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1115.02s)]
*  Mean to her it was just a tough watch. I guess now JD Vance [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1121.98s)]
*  I guess that JD Vance is tagging along [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1126.98s)]
*  He released his own video where he said there was just so much excitement about her visit that he had to come [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1129.74s)]
*  It does not quite seem credible [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1135.18s)]
*  In fact people in Greenland were not thrilled about her trip because you know Trump keeps threatening to invade them [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1137.4199999999998s)]
*  I think Mike waltz is going to Greenland in in the coming days to so fire up your signal app [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1144.06s)]
*  Also just unrelated last week Trump revoked the security clearances from a bunch of former Biden officials and assorted enemies [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1151.1s)]
*  And includes Joe Biden Kamala Harris Tony Blinken Jake Sullivan. I think actually everyone in the Biden family [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1157.66s)]
*  So that's you know a petty and stupid it is just like it's worth noting that [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1163.1000000000001s)]
*  You know these Mike waltz or anyone in the national security team might want to talk to Jake Sullivan or Tony Blinken about something [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1167.22s)]
*  They had worked on over the last four years [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1172.8600000000001s)]
*  And now they can't in a classified setting because they stripped away their security clearance [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1174.42s)]
*  So it seems like a bit of a cell phone here [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1178.68s)]
*  Yeah, that there's clearly things that they don't know, you know conversations that went on with Ukrainians or [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1180.5800000000002s)]
*  Conversations one on the Middle East you'd want to maybe call your predecessor and have that conversation [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1186.98s)]
*  they clearly mentioned that the this visit to Greenland is [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1190.94s)]
*  There's no reason on earth for Usha Vance and I guess JD Vance to attend a dog sledding race in Greenland [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1196.62s)]
*  It's like your first thing like this is your inaugural trip [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1202.86s)]
*  You're running advance on the Greenland invasion and this is backfiring like Greenland which has had some anti Denmark [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1206.74s)]
*  Attitudes some independence movements. They seem to be pretty united in the fact that they don't want you know [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1213.8s)]
*  Usha Vance coming there to advance the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1219.84s)]
*  Takeover of their country via dog sledding tourism, right? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1223.0s)]
*  And so this this is kind of stuff that like people are again look imagine what this looks like from outside the United States [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1226.52s)]
*  We look completely out of control like completely. It's a combination of amateur hour and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1233.52s)]
*  Scary fascistic behavior and that's not like a [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1240.52s)]
*  particularly heartening [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1245.16s)]
*  Combination. No. No, it is not. All right. Let's turn to our ally in Turkey [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1246.8s)]
*  So we covered again some of the basics of this on our YouTube exclusive with niche [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1251.68s)]
*  We've focused a lot of our time on all the ways Elon Musk is trying to screw up [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1255.68s)]
*  British politics and prop up right-wing fringe fringe characters and attack their democracy [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1259.56s)]
*  So fun story, but we also talked about the fact that last week [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1263.8s)]
*  Ekrem Imamolu who's the mayor of Istanbul who is widely viewed as president Erdogan's most formidable political opponent was arrested [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1268.02s)]
*  He was accused of a bunch of stuff of leading a criminal organization. He was charged with corruption [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1276.22s)]
*  He was also accused of supporting terrorism specifically a group called the PKK which who is which is a particular Erdogan bogeyman [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1281.82s)]
*  It's Istanbul University also annulled [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1289.3s)]
*  Imamolu's college degree from 30 years ago and that sounds petty and stupid because it is but it also really matters in Turkey because the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1292.8200000000002s)]
*  Constitution says you have to have a college degree to run for president [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1300.26s)]
*  And so all of this happened right before Imamolu's political party the Republican People's Party or CHP [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1303.98s)]
*  selected him or was set to select him as [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1310.54s)]
*  Candidate to as their candidates who run against Erdogan in the next presidential election, which is set for 2028 [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1313.04s)]
*  So this you know arrest led to it was actually a bunch of arrests [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1319.22s)]
*  I think they arrested like a hundred people it led to massive protests the largest in Turkey in a decade [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1323.4s)]
*  There are reports as of today of over [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1328.22s)]
*  1,100 people getting arrested [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1331.66s)]
*  Everyone called the protesters evil [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1333.74s)]
*  And we can I'll get into the protests themselves and the stakes for Europe more in our interview with Jeremy Shapiro Ben [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1336.38s)]
*  But I think the key takeaway for listeners is that Erdogan is very rapidly pushing Turkey from a democracy [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1342.3s)]
*  to an autocracy [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1349.62s)]
*  The government is arresting political opponents. They're trying to ban protests [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1351.7s)]
*  They're demanding that social media sites block or take down posts from protesters [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1356.08s)]
*  Politico had reported over the weekend that free speech absolutist Elon Musk had suspended some accounts on X [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1361.66s)]
*  His team denies it, but I don't know. I don't believe anything [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1368.34s)]
*  He says these days I don't believe them. Yeah since 2011 or so we have seen some successful protest movements that lead to [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1371.06s)]
*  Governmental change but we've seen many more they get crushed by who you know [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1378.3799999999999s)]
*  I was often referred to as the guys with the guns like the regime [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1382.86s)]
*  What are you watching here to see if what's happening in Turkey can lead to more? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1386.26s)]
*  Democratization and what do you think the stakes are for the region in your opinion? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1391.94s)]
*  Think the challenge is that Turkey's pretty far down the authoritarian road, right? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1395.62s)]
*  Like Erdogan's been going in this direction for over a decade now [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1399.78s)]
*  And he's kind of allowed the semblance of an occasional election [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1403.2199999999998s)]
*  While he's kind of taken over all the other institutions and you know intimidated and sometimes detained opponents [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1407.86s)]
*  What this shows me though that's been clear is that I think if there was a free and fair election in Turkey [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1414.78s)]
*  He would lose and he'd probably lose by a lot and and I know he won the last one [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1421.8799999999999s)]
*  But I mean do we I don't trust that result like I like this guy clearly if you cannot allow for any [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1426.08s)]
*  public airing of dissent if you're so afraid of your political opponent that you're going back and [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1433.3999999999999s)]
*  Making Istanbul University revoke his degree from 30 years ago [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1439.8s)]
*  So he's disqualified from running against you that is not someone who's confident that they actually win a free and fair like yeah [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1443.3999999999999s)]
*  And so I do think it is useful that what people are showing us in the streets in Turkey is just that [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1448.68s)]
*  Erdogan wants the perception that he's this beloved strongman and he's not and so at minimum it's accomplished that [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1454.64s)]
*  now in terms of whether it [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1460.8000000000002s)]
*  Takes hold the question is [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1462.92s)]
*  Can they perpetuate this movement can it sustain can people stay in the streets? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1465.3200000000002s)]
*  Does Erdogan have to make some kind of concession here in releasing the Istanbul mayor are there other? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1469.68s)]
*  Institutions inside Turkey that kind of start to break in the direction of the opposition [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1475.8799999999999s)]
*  Those things are probably unlikely, but I still think it's important that it's just kind of [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1480.9199999999998s)]
*  Registered once because this is not the first protest movement [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1486.28s)]
*  We've seen tricky that the Turkish people like are not on board with where Erdogan is going and his and it's a message for us [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1488.9199999999998s)]
*  Too by the way like let's not wait until it's too late to have our own protest movement [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1495.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's get ourselves out in the streets like right now in terms of the region [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1500.4399999999998s)]
*  What's complicated about it is at this moment? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1504.26s)]
*  Erdogan holds all these cards. He's a key player in Syria because the group that he backed took over Syria [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1507.46s)]
*  he's a key player in the Russia Ukraine talks because [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1513.3400000000001s)]
*  He's been this kind of guy who can shuttle back and forth between the Russians and the Ukrainians the Europeans desperately need Erdogan [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1517.18s)]
*  For a variety of reasons the there are millions of Syrian migrants in Turkey that he could kind of let go into Europe [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1524.5s)]
*  You know in this kind of gross way turkeys this buffer between more migration in Europe and not [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1531.82s)]
*  If there's a European security initiative the Europeans will want Turkey to be a part of it because they have actually a pretty capable military [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1538.46s)]
*  So part of what I'm also worried about is that you're not gonna see any external price, you know Trump [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1545.58s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing us. They love Erdogan nothing coming from the US and that Europeans are probably scared to antagonize him, too [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1550.1399999999999s)]
*  And so he'll probably weather this but I mean we're all seeing before our eyes [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1556.22s)]
*  That the Emperor that has no clothes here [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1561.34s)]
*  Yeah [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1563.6999999999998s)]
*  Now Ben I do have some good news for you as I mentioned at the top Steve Wicoff did this long interview with Tucker Carlson [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1564.3s)]
*  It came out three days ago. So Sunday [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1570.54s)]
*  Which means obviously they recorded it, you know a few days before now in this interview though [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1574.26s)]
*  Wicoff says that Donald Trump recently called [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1579.3799999999999s)]
*  President Erdogan and it all sounds pretty hopeful [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1582.62s)]
*  So here's a clip of Wicoff talking about that call the president had a great conversation with [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1585.34s)]
*  Erdogan a couple of days ago really transformational. I would describe it there. There's there's there's some good coming [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1591.3799999999999s)]
*  There's some just a lot of good positive news coming out of Turkey right now as a result of that conversation [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1597.86s)]
*  So I think you'll see that in the reporting in the coming days [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1603.58s)]
*  So maybe the good positive news was a brutal crackdown on all protesters [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1606.98s)]
*  We gave this guy his due on the Gaza we did we had some walking back to do buddy [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1612.3s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, I you know probably had more to do with the fact that BB wanted to humiliate Biden and give Trump [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1617.04s)]
*  That's true. And now he's resumed his war right but this guy is [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1622.8400000000001s)]
*  literally was on the golf course in [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1628.92s)]
*  You know Florida like five months ago and now he somehow thinks I mean the one thing I'd say about Eric [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1630.92s)]
*  I was in you know, by Laro Ming's that guy [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1636.68s)]
*  Very savvy guy like there's a reason he's kind of navigated the last, you know, 30 years of geopolitics [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1639.5600000000002s)]
*  the idea that Steve Witkoff [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1646.84s)]
*  some Florida real estate developer who joined the geopolitical fray like three months ago has taken the measure of [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1649.0s)]
*  Erdogan and and Putin and and so is moving these people around like chess pieces [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1657.32s)]
*  It's so embarrassing and laughable and you know, just he's got a boast to it to Tucker Carlson about it [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1662.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's I leave it like I don't even know that he's boasting. I just think he's well, they're all boasting [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1669.32s)]
*  They're all just spouting the line for Trump and saying what Trump wants to hear but is so [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1673.96s)]
*  Unbelievably credulous there are times where he kind of says things that normal foreign policy thinkers aren't allowed to say [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1678.66s)]
*  And Tucker Carlson loses his mind you'll hear some of that [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1685.88s)]
*  But there's the credulousness is an incredible and you know [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1688.44s)]
*  Jake Sullivan got a lot of shit for putting in writing right before October 7th that the Middle East had never been [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1691.64s)]
*  quieter [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1698.3600000000001s)]
*  Steve Witkoff saying you're about to hear some great news out of Turkey because the president's amazing call right before the place [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1699.72s)]
*  Explodes in this brutal crackdown is is right up there [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1706.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think what happens because everyone used to do this with Obama too. Like I'm sure he says Oh President Trump [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1709.6000000000001s)]
*  You're so great. This is just transformational leadership and and oh by the way President Trump your envoy [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1716.04s)]
*  Steve Witkoff is the greatest envoy of all and these people just believe it. They're they're so [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1721.88s)]
*  Narcissistic that if Putin or Erdogan like just you know drop a little flattery and they're like, this is the greatest call [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1726.92s)]
*  I'm sure everyone could have said like this is the greatest phone call in the history of phone calls and they like believe that that's [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1733.04s)]
*  True, you know, it's it's pretty embarrassing [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1738.4s)]

*  Because last week we talked about Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's attempt to fire Ronan Barr the head of the Shin Bet [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1877.68s)]
*  Which is Israel's domestic intelligence service on Friday? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1883.28s)]
*  The Israeli Supreme Court issued an injunction and blocked him. They ordered a hearing on the situation in the coming weeks [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1886.84s)]
*  So as we talked about [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1892.84s)]
*  Barr has led the Shin Bet since 2021 if he is forced out [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1894.84s)]
*  He would be the first Shin Bet leader in Israel's history to get fired [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1898.46s)]
*  It is why it has been widely reported that the Shin Bet is investigating ties between Netanyahu's aides and cutter the country [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1901.48s)]
*  There is in the coverage been that there's a suggestion that the wrongdoing could range from [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1909.96s)]
*  Illegal lobbying or taking payments to possibly even being paid spies for the Qatari government [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1916.8s)]
*  It's it's kind of hard to suss it out. But like there's a lot of reading between the lines happening in the coverage [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1923.48s)]
*  Netanyahu's office denies that Ronan Barr's firing is connected to that investigation into his aides [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1928.6399999999999s)]
*  But everyone should doubt that Netanyahu was also now trying to fire Israel's Attorney General [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1934.24s)]
*  She had been trying to slow if not outright prevent Ronan Barr from getting fired [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1939.76s)]
*  Now the good news here is that [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1943.8s)]
*  Netanyahu's cabinet may have unanimously voted against her in a no confidence vote the actual process to remove the Attorney General is far more [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1946.44s)]
*  Onerous and will take some time but these moves together have once again led to massive protests across Israel [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1955.0s)]
*  I've heard reports of up to 100,000 people on the streets, which is enormous given [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1961.84s)]
*  Israel's total population and there's warnings from the Chief Justice of Israel's Supreme Court that there would be a constitutional [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1966.52s)]
*  Crisis of sorts if Netanyahu ignores the Supreme Court, they don't have a constitution, but you go what I mean. So Netanyahu's coalition [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1973.72s)]
*  Unfortunately got stronger last week when this right-wing lunatic [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1981.72s)]
*  We've talked about many times it's our Ben Gavir and his Jewish power party rejoined the government coalition [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1985.08s)]
*  He had quit back in January after the ceasefire and when the ceasefire ended he got back in so Ben, you know [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1990.56s)]
*  There's obvious parallels [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1995.84s)]
*  When we talk about this stuff between the political situation in Israel and what we're now experiencing here in the US [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=1997.88s)]
*  I do have to say the notable difference so far is [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2003.36s)]
*  Israelis to their great credit are back out in the streets and protesting and doing it weekly even [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2007.1599999999999s)]
*  And we are not yet and that seems like a real problem. It is a real problem [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2013.32s)]
*  I mean a hundred thousand Israelis is comparable to I don't know [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2017.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not gonna math but like well over 10 million Americans, you know [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2021.4399999999998s)]
*  and [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2025.32s)]
*  It's pretty obvious what's happening here. I mean the the notion that [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2026.8s)]
*  They at a minimum [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2031.08s)]
*  Netanyahu and his kind of cohort [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2033.16s)]
*  facilitated payments to Hamas as part of this strategy of keeping them in power and keeping the Palestinian leadership divided and [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2035.68s)]
*  Having Hamas as a boogeyman that is so well documented [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2043.68s)]
*  And there's a question of whether that policy emerged from these Qataris and was sort of like [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2047.8s)]
*  given to the Israeli side or whether [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2053.4s)]
*  It certainly sounds like that policy came from Netanyahu's political aides and not the security establishment [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2055.76s)]
*  Yes, I can't I mean, I don't know and I'll get to this in a second [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2061.7200000000003s)]
*  But you know, I don't know for sure but like I can't imagine like the IDF or Shin Bet being like hey [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2066.2400000000002s)]
*  we've got a good idea, you know, and and let's like fund Hamas and [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2071.14s)]
*  But wouldn't you like to know I mean that that's my key point here is like [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2076.84s)]
*  Wouldn't if you were Israeli or by the way a US taxpayer that just keeps shoveling billions of dollars in bombs at Israel [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2080.72s)]
*  Wouldn't you like to know whether or not this was a scheme thrust upon the Israelis by you know [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2087.9599999999996s)]
*  Somebody else or whether there were a couple of bad apples or whether the Prime Minister himself had approved this like this is exactly [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2093.9199999999996s)]
*  What you would want to investigate, you know, and it's very clear that Netanyahu [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2101.24s)]
*  I mean it kind of a tell that he doesn't want this person to keep investigating, you know in a system in which the shin bet [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2106.64s)]
*  Even even more so than the FBI in the United States is supposed to be this kind of sacrosanct independent security service [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2114.16s)]
*  and and now you know what we're seeing is the kind of copycat of Trump like, you know, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2120.24s)]
*  BB wants his own cash Patel in charge of the shin bet, you know, that's what's happening here and everybody can see it and [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2125.12s)]
*  Let me just say that all the enablers of Netanyahu in this country in the United States all the APAC crowd are [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2131.4399999999996s)]
*  They're part of this, you know, like call this out [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2139.52s)]
*  Why are we running interference of this fucking guy? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2142.2799999999997s)]
*  The Israelis are in the streets in huge numbers and yet, you know people like watch what they say about this in the United States [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2144.48s)]
*  Why is this not a bigger story in the United States? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2150.6s)]
*  I know huge deal, you know, and it barely registers people are afraid to talk about it [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2152.7999999999997s)]
*  The exact moment when the Trump administration is telling kids at Columbia University [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2157.16s)]
*  What they can and cannot say about the Israeli government or Israeli government policies [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2162.8399999999997s)]
*  You've got Israelis saying far more harsh things about Netanyahu and this anti-government crackdown that's happening than anyone here ever will [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2167.24s)]
*  We're talking about some kid at Columbia, you know chanting a slogan you don't like and it's too friendly to Hamas [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2173.52s)]
*  And so we're gonna deport that person. We're talking about Israeli leaders potentially [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2179.08s)]
*  Funneling millions of dollars to Hamas, you know, like seems worse. Isn't that more of us? Isn't that more providing support is [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2183.7200000000003s)]
*  what's worse in terms of supporting Hamas like facilitating all this money getting to them or [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2191.2400000000002s)]
*  Like changing a slogan at the Columbia University quad like what planet are we? Yeah, it's crazy [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2197.0800000000004s)]
*  So we mentioned that unfortunately the war in Gaza has restarted these really started bombing again [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2201.48s)]
*  The Gaza Health Ministry now says that more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war started [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2206.5600000000004s)]
*  700 of them since the end of the ceasefire a third of those they say were children. It's just another horrifying statistic [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2212.7599999999998s)]
*  Israel's defense minister Israel Katz says pretty overtly they're ramping the war back up. Here's a quote [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2220.4799999999996s)]
*  I have instructed the IDF to seize additional areas in Gaza [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2225.9599999999996s)]
*  While evacuating the population and to expand the security zones around Gaza for the protection of Israeli communities and IDF soldiers [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2229.2s)]
*  The more Hamas persists in its refusal to release the hostages more territory [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2235.0s)]
*  Which will be annexed to Israel kind of giving away the game there [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2238.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2242.28s)]
*  A bunch of news outlets reported the IDF is considering a huge ground operation [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2242.48s)]
*  An offensive into Gaza with the goal of fully occupying the Gaza Strip and establishing military rule there [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2246.32s)]
*  Ominously Israel is also setting up an agency to supervise the quote voluntary departure of Gazans from the Gaza Strip [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2252.08s)]
*  Which is a move that echoes Trump's plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2258.1200000000003s)]
*  But again, then our buddy Steve Wyckoff had to weigh in two quotes [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2261.76s)]
*  We want to play for you guys [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2265.48s)]
*  The first is this one of Steve talking about Hamas what they want is unacceptable [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2266.52s)]
*  What's acceptable to us is they need to demilitarize then maybe they could stay there a little bit right be involved politically [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2272.08s)]
*  But they can't be involved. We can't have a terrorist organization running running [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2278.36s)]
*  Gaza because that won't be acceptable to Israel then we'll just have the same [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2283.16s)]
*  Exact experiences or every every five ten fifteen years. We're gonna have an October 27th. Yes, October 7th [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2287.88s)]
*  Pardon me. So that's what Hamas wants [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2294.92s)]
*  That's not possible that clip to me was kind of the duality of Wyckoff then because he is [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2298.0s)]
*  Like I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that Hamas might play some role in the future governance of Gaza [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2303.4s)]
*  But you sure as hell better believe that Netanyahu is never gonna let that happen is probably furious that Wyckoff would let that slip [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2308.56s)]
*  So it's just interesting to hear him say it. Yeah, and I don't really get there [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2314.6400000000003s)]
*  What's missing here is a theory of you because you're right. You could listen to me like, okay, that's reasonable [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2318.76s)]
*  Like Hamas needs to abandon its kind of military wing demilitarize and then be a part of some political structure in Gaza [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2323.68s)]
*  but there's no [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2331.3599999999997s)]
*  like vision for how [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2333.16s)]
*  Any of that happens, you know, like like there's not like a horizon for [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2335.8399999999997s)]
*  Palestinian reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority or the generation of new Palestinian leadership [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2341.08s)]
*  There's certainly no discussion of when Gaza will be self-governing again [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2345.6s)]
*  There's no discussion obviously of a Palestinian state and so there are these kind of demands made in interviews with you know [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2350.54s)]
*  Tucker Carlson or wherever and then all that we see in practice is Israel bombing Gaza again [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2356.7400000000002s)]
*  They're killing journalists and children. We send our weapons and [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2363.1s)]
*  And we send more weapons and then the defense minister is literally talking about annexation of parts of Gaza [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2366.86s)]
*  and so it's hard for me to take seriously that Wyckoff is like trying to [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2371.98s)]
*  Solve some problem. It just it feels like a different flavor [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2376.78s)]
*  Talking while Israel's creating facts on the ground that look increasingly like a plan for annexation and ethnic cleansing [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2381.46s)]
*  I mean that and you say that people get you know, been out of shape [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2389.18s)]
*  It's like they're saying that like the Israeli Minister of Defense said the word annexation. It's clear as day [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2391.58s)]
*  And just to add to what you said [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2397.38s)]
*  I mean [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2400.14s)]
*  We also want to play for you a quote of Steve Wyckoff talking about Gaza [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2400.94s)]
*  Reconstruction that I think gets at the utter absurdity of whatever plan they might have or I guess just a lack of plan [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2404.46s)]
*  Here is more from Steve Wyckoff on Tucker Carlson. We're gonna attempt to [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2410.66s)]
*  You know to ascertain [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2414.98s)]
*  different development plans for Gaza [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2416.98s)]
*  Could involve the word to state could not involve the word to state that you don't hear that anymore [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2419.5s)]
*  I mean for my whole life the at the stated aspiration was a Palestinian state [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2425.42s)]
*  But man, I haven't in the past five or six ten years heard [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2431.2200000000003s)]
*  anybody in authority [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2436.14s)]
*  Even mention it because when you use those words, you know, it's like it's like a flashpoint, right? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2438.58s)]
*  So I use the word I can be attacked for it. I'm to me. It's just a word, right? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2444.3799999999997s)]
*  What what to state to me means is how do we have a better living prescription? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2449.42s)]
*  for [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2455.66s)]
*  Palestinians who were living in Gaza [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2456.94s)]
*  Let's get it. Let's get to that place, but it's not just about housing. Maybe it's about AI coming there [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2459.06s)]
*  Maybe it's about hyperscale data centers being seeded into that area [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2464.7000000000003s)]
*  Because we need to have that and these people can now take advantage and we can create jobs for them there [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2469.7000000000003s)]
*  Maybe it's about blockchain and robotics coming there. Maybe it's about [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2475.6200000000003s)]
*  Pharmaceutical manufacturing coming there. So interesting that we're walking away completely from the two-state solution [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2479.86s)]
*  Well also suggesting then that Gaza's power grid which even pre October 7th was sometimes only able to supply [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2486.6200000000003s)]
*  two to four hours worth of electricity to residents per day is primed and ready for AI and [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2493.7799999999997s)]
*  Blockchain is it that's what we're talking about here. That's that's our plan. I [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2500.58s)]
*  Don't even know what to say about that and I'd heard it before but doesn't he sound like someone [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2504.2599999999998s)]
*  Having a conversation with Trump on the golf course, you know, like first of all is to stay what like you keep saying it [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2510.54s)]
*  Word that's accepted Trump in formulation [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2518.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna say the word two-state which might be two words or [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2520.66s)]
*  Put that aside yeah, I don't like this [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2526.38s)]
*  This is like a version of Trump's thing about like we're gonna [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2531.06s)]
*  Depopulate and create a revere and now we're gonna bring [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2534.74s)]
*  All the things that they like that they don't fully understand, you know AI [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2537.2599999999998s)]
*  blockchain data centers [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2543.94s)]
*  I [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2546.14s)]
*  pharmaceuticals making a cameo appearance like it sounded like a bullshit tech company's earnings call [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2547.34s)]
*  It's like they're obviously gonna sprinkle in some buzzwords for a fucking algorithm that makes stock prices go up [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2551.9s)]
*  But what are you talking about? It sounds like an Aussie media pitch, you know [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2557.58s)]
*  Sorry, there's still two inside [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2563.42s)]
*  We've got a PowerPoint, you know [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2566.42s)]
*  where like the first deck is first slide is like [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2568.5s)]
*  Gaza rubble and the second is like a data center an AI like these are human beings and the other thing that actually is truly [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2571.46s)]
*  Notable about this. So is it he doesn't even mention the West Bank? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2578.92s)]
*  Cuz like actually I think that's probably just gonna be annexed, you know gradually by Israel [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2584.0600000000004s)]
*  You know, like the the heart of the two-state solution is actually in the West Bank, you know [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2588.6600000000003s)]
*  So I don't know man [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2593.2200000000003s)]
*  Leave that with a great deal of confidence that there's gonna be a flowering of data centers in the [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2595.62s)]
*  You know independent Palestinian state of Gaza anytime soon. We are gonna blockchain our way to peace [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2602.22s)]
*  Two other quick things on this [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2608.82s)]
*  It's worth noting that there have been some flare-ups between Israel and Lebanon [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2610.1s)]
*  that the BBC describes as the worst violence between the two countries since [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2613.78s)]
*  The the ceasefire in Lebanon came into effect last November [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2617.86s)]
*  That's troubling and something we're watching and then also there was a [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2620.94s)]
*  Horrible incident yesterday in the West Bank that we wanted to highlight which was Hamdan Bilal [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2624.1800000000003s)]
*  Who is the Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary? No other land. He was attacked by [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2628.82s)]
*  violent Israeli settlers [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2635.3s)]
*  We were able to connect with a witness a woman named Jenna who was there as a volunteer for the Center for Jewish non-violence [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2637.02s)]
*  She and some other volunteers received a call from Bilal saying he was being attacked and here's how she described what happened next [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2644.02s)]
*  We drove to Hamdan's house already there. There was a ton of police and soldier cars army vehicles [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2651.02s)]
*  So we thought we had seen soldiers on the top of the hill where we're harmed on live [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2658.34s)]
*  So we started three of us got out of the car and started walking towards the house in reality [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2662.78s)]
*  It turns out that it was actually the settlers who were attacking [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2666.9s)]
*  One of them came towards us. He was masked. He started screaming at us. I was screaming in English at him [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2669.98s)]
*  You know, don't do this [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2677.38s)]
*  He shoved me pretty hard and then he punched my friend in the stomach and in the neck and [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2679.38s)]
*  So we tried to run back to the car. They were hitting us with [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2687.82s)]
*  With sticks I was basically saved because of an sunscreen aerosol can in my back to the brunt force [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2692.1800000000003s)]
*  Very very dented but still works. Thank you banana boat [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2701.1400000000003s)]
*  Thank you banana boat [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2704.9s)]
*  and [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2707.14s)]
*  As we were getting to the car they were throwing stones [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2709.98s)]
*  broke the windows slash the tire [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2713.82s)]
*  the driver was honking the horn to get the army's attention and they eventually showed up and the settlers ran back to continue the attack on [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2716.98s)]
*  Hamdan and the other two Palestinians houses [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2725.3s)]
*  We were telling the soldiers like they attacked us. They attacked us like help us go get them and the soldiers stood there and did nothing [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2728.3s)]
*  We told them that there's families in these houses. They needed to go protect them. They just stood there and did nothing [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2735.3s)]
*  Shut at the Jenna in the in the Center for Jewish non-violence for literally putting their bodies [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2741.5s)]
*  On the line in the wake of this horrific violence and she's frankly describing something that happens far too often which is that [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2746.6600000000003s)]
*  The IDF soldiers who are in the West Bank are more there to protect [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2754.58s)]
*  Violent settlers than any of the residents there including any peaceful protesters who often get brutalized [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2759.02s)]
*  So the good news is that Hamda Bala was released Tuesday after being held overnight at a military base [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2764.94s)]
*  The Guardian reported that he had bruises on his face blood on his clothes [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2771.1800000000003s)]
*  But thank God was alive [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2775.6s)]
*  Someone initially tweeted that he'd been lynched and it was not clear if this person was speaking kind of metaphorically or or literally is very [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2777.06s)]
*  Scary for a minute, but you know Ben we focus so much on Gaza over the last, you know year and a half two years [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2783.2400000000002s)]
*  But this incident is just a reminder that [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2788.38s)]
*  Settler violence is a huge and growing problem and like you said a minute ago [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2790.78s)]
*  It feels like the plan for the West Bank is [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2795.06s)]
*  Israeli annexation. Yeah, and it's a constant [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2797.86s)]
*  so what happens is settlers to attack people Palestinians and [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2800.2400000000002s)]
*  Then the IDF comes and arrests the Palestinians, you know [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2803.9s)]
*  And the settlers have impunity and that is what is happening right now in Israel in the West Bank [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2806.6800000000003s)]
*  It has been for years and and in this particular case, you know, he wins an Academy Award [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2812.06s)]
*  That's why they're attacking him right, you know, it's because they know that for variety reasons [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2817.62s)]
*  like Americans will not speak up in defense of this person and and and [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2824.38s)]
*  Like our silence is a permission slip for them to do what they did and the last thing I'd say is Tommy every now and then [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2829.7s)]
*  like [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2836.7799999999997s)]
*  Something like this will happen and I'm sure you you know, you and I've talked about this before on the podcast [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2837.74s)]
*  But like we have people in our lives, you know [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2842.86s)]
*  Why are you hard on Israel and we get emails from people? I just want how do you defend this? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2845.22s)]
*  Yeah, like like I want to ask all those people [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2850.7s)]
*  How do you defend a group of settled this guy did nothing? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2854.14s)]
*  He made a movie that went into Khan Academy Ward [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2857.4599999999996s)]
*  He was in his house and some people showed up and beat the shit out of him [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2859.74s)]
*  And then the authorities came and arrested him [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2862.98s)]
*  How do you defend that this has nothing to do with Hamas? This isn't Gaza October 7th [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2865.7s)]
*  How do you defend that like like I I met a loss for words to understand [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2871.1s)]
*  I just don't understand the mentality of people that can see that and think it's okay [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2876.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and it's it's maybe not state-sponsored, but it's state-supported violence, you know [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2881.94s)]
*  These ideas enabled. Yeah minimum for sure [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2887.58s)]
*  I mean these IDF soldiers there they're solely there to protect the settlers and you've got people like it's bar Ben Gavir [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2890.3s)]
*  Who is now a part of the government again who is helping arm these violent settlers? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2896.02s)]
*  so it's it [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2900.2599999999998s)]
*  It's very scary stuff then okay [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2901.58s)]
*  we are gonna switch gears entirely though and talk about Russia because [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2904.2999999999997s)]
*  on Tuesday Russia and Ukraine agreed to stop fighting in the Black Sea and [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2907.62s)]
*  Also agreed to continue trying to work out details for a ceasefire between the two sides on energy infrastructure [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2912.2599999999998s)]
*  Remember Trump had announced this I think last week [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2918.7799999999997s)]
*  This all happened during these US mediated talks that are going on in Saudi Arabia now. It's worth pointing out Russia is [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2921.06s)]
*  Demanding even more concessions before they'll agree to even this very limited ceasefire in the Black Sea [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2929.58s)]
*  Specifically they want to restore their agricultural banks access to the international payment system [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2935.66s)]
*  And they want to get the West to lift restrictions on quote trade finance operations [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2940.14s)]
*  Basically, they're demanding that the US walk back even more sanctions even more penalties that were imposed on Russia after the full-scale invasion in 2022 [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2944.74s)]
*  Now not surprisingly the White House okayed this additional giveaway [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2953.8599999999997s)]
*  To the Russians in their statement about these talks and again a ceasefire deal [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2958.62s)]
*  That is just focused on the Black Sea is already tilted toward the Russians because yes [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2963.22s)]
*  That's the one place where the Ukrainians because of these interesting like boat drones [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2968.74s)]
*  They created have been able to cause a lot of damage and really target the Russian Navy in an impactful way and kind of shut down [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2972.1s)]
*  whole areas of operations that they're they're shipping but [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2979.2999999999997s)]
*  Again, we want to play like one last clip of our boy Steve Wyckoff [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2983.2999999999997s)]
*  Talking with Tucker Carlson this time about Putin and you know US relations with Russia [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2987.2200000000003s)]
*  Here's Steve again. President Putin had commissioned a beautiful [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2992.98s)]
*  Portrait of the president Trump from the leading Russian artist and actually gave it to me and asked me to take it home to President Trump [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=2997.7000000000003s)]
*  Which I brought home and delivered to him. It's been reported in the paper, but it was such a gracious [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3005.1400000000003s)]
*  Moment and told me a story Tucker about how when the president was shot [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3010.06s)]
*  He went to his local church [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3015.6s)]
*  And met with his priest and prayed for the president not because he was the president of the United [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3018.24s)]
*  He could be become the president of the United States [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3024.04s)]
*  But because he had a friendship with him and he was praying for his friend someone [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3026.7999999999997s)]
*  I was talking to someone in the administration and they said well, you know, you got to watch it because he's an ex-KGB guy [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3030.2599999999998s)]
*  So I said, okay, what what's what's the inference? Well, he's an ex-KGB guy. He could be looking to manipulate you [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3035.12s)]
*  He's a super smart guy, okay, you don't want to give him the credit for it. That's okay. I give him the credit [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3042.2799999999997s)]
*  But he is I know [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3050.64s)]
*  I think the largest issue in that conflict are these so-called four regions Don boss as a Crimea [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3053.6s)]
*  You know the names yeah Lugansk and there's there there's two others [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3064.12s)]
*  First of all, I mean I like I'm used to Tucker Carlson's laugh, but it's it's still just so jarring [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3068.82s)]
*  It's like he's being chased around by Jack Nicholson and the shining it's like so hysterical [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3075.06s)]
*  But you hear that and it's so credulous and he's clearly being manipulated [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3079.78s)]
*  Then mocks the people warning him about being manipulated and like of course Zelensky is apoplectic about these peace talks and and [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3084.2200000000003s)]
*  Witkoff, you know having this major role in these things even like Putin's friends [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3090.86s)]
*  Would not be as credulous of Putin as Steve Witkoff, right? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3096.5s)]
*  Like oh he had a painting of Trump done. He lit a candle in the church [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3100.8s)]
*  How many mics in that painting you believe you believe it like I'm it's amazing [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3105.34s)]
*  Steve Witkoff is walking around and it like he's probably like like wait till wait wait till someone sends him one of those like [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3110.66s)]
*  Nigerian Prince emails and like he's gonna give away his fortune like this is the guy in charge of the ending the war like [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3117.46s)]
*  Like [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3124.98s)]
*  There's nobody on earth as credulous of Putin is that you know [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3126.54s)]
*  like Xi Jinping doesn't trust Putin like like in that way and the fact that [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3130.3s)]
*  And then Tucker by the way coming in with like the right the four Russian the four provinces [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3136.82s)]
*  those are part of Ukraine, right and [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3142.34s)]
*  Like Tucker's jumping in he knows them like he's got the I mean these guys are a little too familiar with the Russian narrative [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3146.1800000000003s)]
*  For you to be comfortable about it. They're not disputed provinces [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3152.58s)]
*  They're not familiar enough to name the fucking territory that he's trying to negotiate away from the Ukrainians can't remember their names [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3156.1s)]
*  No, that's the thing is I love that the envoy doesn't know it but the kind of Russia [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3163.22s)]
*  You know the super pro-russian talk show is like I'll jump in there. It's Luhansk or whatever [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3166.98s)]
*  You know and they but these are not disputed provinces [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3171.94s)]
*  These are parts of Ukraine that Russia invaded and try is trying to annex and they're talking about them like you know [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3175.08s)]
*  Then I'm glad you said because these guys these were the MAGA types keep talking about Tucker in particular keep talking about how they're oh [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3181.02s)]
*  They were referendum in these Russian speaking eastern provinces [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3188.38s)]
*  But first of all a lot of people in these areas speak both Russian and Ukrainian [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3193.2s)]
*  But to the extent that there were you referendums they were done under occupation under duress [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3196.9s)]
*  There is literal visual evidence of ballot boxes where the results were not to the liking of the Russian side [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3202.84s)]
*  That were lit on fire and burned this is very well established and like I'm fine with you know [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3209.26s)]
*  If Tucker's like big point is like okay. We should hear the Russian perspective understand [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3215.0600000000004s)]
*  Their threats you know like where you sit is where you stand that's part of diplomacy sure [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3220.1000000000004s)]
*  But you don't be fucking credulous you don't have to believe everything they say yeah [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3224.86s)]
*  They're not even talking about NATO and larger anymore there now [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3229.1200000000003s)]
*  They're fully inhabiting the Russian narrative about provinces and put you know [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3231.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna make a gen X reference is the painting like if all goes to shit for Trump [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3234.8599999999997s)]
*  It's gonna be like Vince Vaughn walking out at [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3239.7799999999997s)]
*  wedding crashers [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3242.94s)]
*  Like the painting was a gift Todd like I'm keeping it like [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3244.2999999999997s)]
*  Last possession that he will yeah, yeah the last possession that he will carry out of the White House is that painting [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3248.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm sure he will gifted him. I mean like the Moscow Times reported the Kremlin's purposely slow walking the talks [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3253.66s)]
*  Thank you for reporting it out, but no shit [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3259.3399999999997s)]
*  Again Putin's aims are pretty maximalist like he won't even agree to a 30-day ceasefire [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3261.94s)]
*  Which remember is what Trump actually wanted not these limited ceasefires [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3265.98s)]
*  But the Russian position is that to get there would require a halt to Western military aid to Ukraine and to their country's [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3269.46s)]
*  Mobilization efforts of their own troops, which is just non starters, but again [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3276.7000000000003s)]
*  There's just no pressure applied to the Russian side none zero none all right Ben two conflicts [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3280.2400000000002s)]
*  There's two major conflicts in Africa that we've talked about a lot that we wanted to touch on again today [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3285.7000000000003s)]
*  The first is the Civil War in Sudan that war is coming up on its two-year anniversary [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3289.58s)]
*  of the fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3295.62s)]
*  Its former ally this militia group called the RSF so the results of this war have been utterly catastrophic [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3298.6600000000003s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people have been killed twelve million people have been displaced an estimated thirty million people need food assistance [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3304.9s)]
*  And of course all of this is happening as Elon Musk and deputy assistant assistant deputy of state Rubio [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3310.86s)]
*  Destroy USAID then you have the UN United Nations is trying to kind of fill the gap here [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3318.82s)]
*  And they are not even able to raise 50% of their assistance goals [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3323.7400000000002s)]
*  So there's a massive need and even less resources to deal with it, but there was a pretty big [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3328.06s)]
*  military and symbolic breakthrough in the war last week when the Sudanese Armed Forces [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3335.2200000000003s)]
*  Captured the presidential palace in Khartoum [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3339.98s)]
*  Hopefully there's not like a look [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3342.78s)]
*  Good guys bad guys is a reductive way to talk about this the Sudanese Armed Forces were part of a coup that toppled the [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3345.3s)]
*  democratically elected group of peaceful [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3352.1800000000003s)]
*  Protesters like they're not good guys [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3355.5s)]
*  But in this case I think they're better than the RSF and hopefully the the SAF the Sudanese Armed Forces [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3357.3s)]
*  Will be able to drive the RSF troops out of the capital so people can go home and the government can try to [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3362.5400000000004s)]
*  Resume function to some extent restore basic services [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3368.0600000000004s)]
*  Maybe create some sort of technocratic government that can get people like power water food aid, etc [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3372.3s)]
*  but even if they capture all of Khartoum that doesn't do much for people in the Darfur region because you know many of the [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3377.58s)]
*  Same Islamist rebel groups that conducted the genocide in Darfur in the early 2000s are now part of the RSF and they're once again [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3383.86s)]
*  Doing evil shit killing civilians using rape as a tool of war [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3389.86s)]
*  Laying siege to entire cities full of like a million plus displaced people. So [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3394.26s)]
*  Again, USAID has been decimated [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3398.7000000000003s)]
*  There's not even nearly enough food and medical support [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3401.4199999999996s)]
*  But then what are you watching in this conflict after this kind of turning point in in Khartoum? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3404.8599999999997s)]
*  It just does feel like this is decisively shifted. It makes you wonder what was the point of all this, you know [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3410.3399999999997s)]
*  What was the point of this civil war? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3415.58s)]
*  Why would the [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3417.8199999999997s)]
*  Governments like the UAE back the RSF for two years took two for what purpose, you know? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3419.62s)]
*  When and so I want is to watch whether there's any continued foreign assistance [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3425.78s)]
*  Flowing into the RSF from places like the UAE or whether they just kind of go back to being a pariah [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3431.5s)]
*  And I think that will probably happen to your point. I assume that the military will consolidate control over Khartoum [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3436.06s)]
*  Watch what happens in Darfur though? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3442.54s)]
*  Because these guys the RSF they were the John Dewey before they were the RSF they could go back there kind of take it [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3444.26s)]
*  Out on people there [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3449.3s)]
*  But the main thing to watch is what happens with there's no USAID because [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3450.1s)]
*  This would be a place where the USAID would be not only on the ground [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3455.18s)]
*  But it'd be a force multiplier bringing in other assistance and and so we I think we have to watch [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3459.58s)]
*  How much philanderpiece can get neat, you know basic needs net the basic needs met how much you know [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3464.46s)]
*  For other Europeans and other governments can come in and I worry that that's not gonna happen and that you're gonna have a lingering humanitarian crisis [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3470.24s)]
*  Yeah, me too it is it is really really bad and really dark the USAID piece is [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3477.06s)]
*  Horrific I did I noticed that Marco Rubio in his I think [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3482.82s)]
*  Confirmation hearing talked about the need to pressure the UAE to stop funneling arms to the RSF though [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3487.26s)]
*  I think he just recently went to the UAE [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3492.96s)]
*  That topic was not part of his public readout. Maybe it came up privately, but he was far more focused on the UAE [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3495.58s)]
*  You know pumping money into the US economy or whatever Trump wanted to talk about [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3502.34s)]
*  So yet, I'm not sure we're getting the leadership we need there [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3505.66s)]
*  And then the second conflict that we've been wanted to talk about was in the Congo [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3508.68s)]
*  So the quick backstory is in recent months the m23 rebel group with explicit support from the Rwandan military [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3513.3799999999997s)]
*  Has invaded big parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3520.54s)]
*  This fighting is believed to have killed at least 7,000 people and displaced more than 7 million people and then last week the m23 [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3524.14s)]
*  Troops attacked even further west into a city called Wali Kale [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3532.1800000000003s)]
*  That is both a mining hub and also an important strategic location because it's got a road there that connects four provinces in Eastern Congo [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3535.86s)]
*  Officials in Rwanda and Congo met in Qatar last week [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3544.78s)]
*  They talked about a possible ceasefire, but an m23 leader poured cold water on it and said basically they would refuse to honor any agreement [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3548.26s)]
*  That's cut without them [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3556.0600000000004s)]
*  Now this gets weirder when you learn about this this offer from the president of Congo Felix Chesicade [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3557.94s)]
*  Who is clearly concerned that things are getting at it worse not better? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3565.06s)]
*  So he offered the Trump administration a deal that would allow the US access to Congo's [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3568.62s)]
*  Estimated 24 trillion dollars worth of mineral resources in exchange for some sort of military support to expel the m23 [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3575.7000000000003s)]
*  Then there's also reports that a soulless private mercenary named Eric Prince who once ran an organization [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3582.22s)]
*  Go called Blackwater [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3588.74s)]
*  this private militia group has been in talks with the [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3590.5s)]
*  Officials in Congo about providing security for their mining operations and for to the government especially the government's tax collectors [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3593.74s)]
*  We're trying to get money from these miners [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3599.8799999999997s)]
*  It's just hard to think of a set up more [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3601.8799999999997s)]
*  Rife for abuse and human rights violations and Eric Prince in the Congo [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3604.5s)]
*  What are you watching when it comes to this m23 assault into the DRC? [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3609.44s)]
*  I think we just learned a few things one is that you know Rwanda and the m23 always deny that they're [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3614.96s)]
*  Focused on minerals. They always claim some need to create a buffer or secure [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3621.8s)]
*  Tutsis or their ethnic group, but what everything they're doing suggested they're trying to seize [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3626.88s)]
*  Minerals in Eastern Congo that are of immense value [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3633.42s)]
*  That's that's clear and so I'd watch whether they just push further whether in this kind of new world order where everybody's you know [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3636.1400000000003s)]
*  Trump's gonna grab minerals in Greenland it you know that they just feel like it's legitimized for them to do that [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3643.46s)]
*  And then how much human cost goes along with that and then I would really really watch this Eric Prince thing [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3649.2200000000003s)]
*  yeah, and and if not them, you know some iteration of the Wagner grouper because [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3655.38s)]
*  The the the Congolese army cannot stand up to m23 [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3660.02s)]
*  There's tons of money down there if you're at Princeton you can get a stake of the mineral resources for providing security [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3663.8199999999997s)]
*  The Russians have been deep in in the DRC themselves [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3670.3399999999997s)]
*  And so I think this could kind of become a playground for the worst kinds of people in the world [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3674.02s)]
*  These private mercenaries and I would watch that very closely [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3678.8599999999997s)]
*  This feels like it could go get a lot worse and in kind of all the worst people in the world could descend on this place [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3682.5s)]
*  Yeah, I just happened to the Congolese before you know [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3688.0s)]
*  No [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3690.56s)]
*  I look I read that Wall Street Journal story about Eric Prince making this pitch to do whatever in the Congo and it sent a shiver [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3690.84s)]
*  Down my spine these private mercenaries trying to extract rare earth minerals in the Congo like cheese cobalt and lithium [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3697.0s)]
*  Like a bad horror movie. There was a great piece in foreign affairs about this conflict and the kind of history there [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3703.6000000000004s)]
*  It's just worth pointing out Ben the the Western response so far has been pretty pathetic like there was some joint statements between the US and Europe [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3709.2400000000002s)]
*  Obviously, that's not worth anything the UN Security Council called for a ceasefire and withdrawal of m23 troops [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3716.2000000000003s)]
*  But they're not doing anything about it [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3721.8s)]
*  The US has put some sanctions in place the EU is reviewing a joint minerals [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3723.6s)]
*  Extraction deal it has with Rwanda [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3729.7200000000003s)]
*  But apparently Luxembourg is blocking any EU sanctions on Rwanda because they want to develop some sort of financial center in Rwanda and [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3731.36s)]
*  Interestingly, I mean I think as you were saying [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3739.6800000000003s)]
*  Initially this conflict was viewed as having more parochial origins [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3742.16s)]
*  Like there was some talk that Rwanda president Paul Kagame [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3746.44s)]
*  It was mad about getting cut out of a deal to create some sort of regional road and rail infrastructure [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3749.52s)]
*  But as m23 has taken more territory people are taking a harder look at some of his past statements [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3755.56s)]
*  Especially a speech he gave in 2023 where he suggested that Rwanda's pre-colonial borders [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3761.8799999999997s)]
*  Include parts of the Congo and also Uganda and Burundi [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3768.52s)]
*  So there's real concern that this is more of like a Vladimir Putin. Let's return [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3773.04s)]
*  You know the Rwandan Imperial Empire approach more than something else. Yeah, Greater Rwanda. Exactly [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3778.2s)]
*  Okay, so feels that way. Yeah, it feels pretty scary. So quick immigration update [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3785.84s)]
*  Over the weekend Venezuela agreed to begin accepting deportation flights from the US with Venezuelan president [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3790.32s)]
*  Nicolas Maduro saying it was an opportunity to quote rescue and free migrants from prisons in the US that original [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3796.4s)]
*  Patriation deal I think we talked about on the show had been worked out by a friend of the pod Rick Cornell back in January [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3803.52s)]
*  Before falling apart after Trump revoked Chevron's oil license in Venezuela [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3809.0s)]
*  Also on Monday, then Trump announced that the US is going to place [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3814.0s)]
*  25% tariffs on any country that buys Venezuelan oil or gas in late last week [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3817.84s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security announced it would revoke protected status temporary protected status for over 500,000 immigrants from Cuba Haiti [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3822.82s)]
*  Nicaragua and Venezuela [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3830.5s)]
*  so that means now hundreds of thousands of people who are all here legally can either deport themselves or [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3831.9s)]
*  Ice or even the IRS has been reported some places [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3838.94s)]
*  We'll try to find them and deport them by this April 24th deadline, which is less than a month from now [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3842.32s)]
*  So this is just unbelievably grim stuff then because you know Haiti as we've covered is [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3848.2599999999998s)]
*  experiencing gang violence at levels that you would normally only see in an active war zone and [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3853.7799999999997s)]
*  Trump is at the same time [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3860.3799999999997s)]
*  Actively trying to destroy what's left of Venezuela's economy with more sanctions while telling people who are here legally [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3863.3799999999997s)]
*  That their options are go home to a dictator that you have fled or worse [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3870.62s)]
*  End up in a gulag down in El Salvador. It is the most unbelievably cruel thing you can imagine [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3876.7799999999997s)]
*  to hundreds of thousands of people, you know, there's not a small number of people that like [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3882.54s)]
*  The US is you you get to be in a gulag. You get to go back to war zone [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3888.62s)]
*  Or you get to get hunted down by ice [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3893.98s)]
*  I mean this is having a horrific human cost to populations that are not you know [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3895.96s)]
*  These they're here legally TPS like [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3902.54s)]
*  There didn't storm the border like these are people that have a legal status [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3905.7400000000002s)]
*  The only other thing I want to add to this Tommy is that [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3909.6800000000003s)]
*  Marco Rubio [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3912.1800000000003s)]

*  USAID democracy funding for Cuba the termination of radio Marty [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3924.9s)]
*  The mass deportation and prohibition on Cubans [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3930.18s)]
*  Entering the United States some friend of the Cuban people this guy turned out to be [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3934.62s)]
*  Yep, you know who's been posing as a champion really? I mean, it's comical. It's absolutely comical [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3938.5s)]
*  Hello, South Florida hardliners. Here is your hero. Here's your god Marco Rubio throwing your people out of the country [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3944.5s)]
*  Terminating any lifeline to them like what a joke, you know [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3952.18s)]
*  Give me like it boggles anybody who falls and I know this is kind of niche [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3956.22s)]
*  But anybody who's followed the cube issue for for decades [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3960.58s)]
*  This is [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3964.7s)]

*  This guy's a walking Greek tragedy [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3973.54s)]
*  It is just so fitting that [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3975.18s)]
*  the cost for him to ascend to the heights of government power that he thinks he deserve is to literally [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3977.06s)]
*  Overturn everything he's ever believed in and actively harm the things he's worked on over the course of his career [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3983.94s)]
*  It's just pitch perfect for Marco Rubio and he could have been invited into the group chat if just by being an Atlantic reporter [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3989.1s)]
*  He did [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=3994.7s)]

*  Two parties can work together for a minority government. The party will then pick its leader in that person becomes prime minister [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4031.18s)]

*  I just messaged Canadians. I know you already know this but when Trump said he was endorsing Mark Carney, that's called trolling [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4067.3s)]
*  He does not actually want Mark Carney to win. No wants him to lose [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4075.5s)]

*  Thanks for having me. There is a lot going on in Europe [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4492.4400000000005s)]
*  So I was very excited to talk with you an expert on a whole range of things [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4495.08s)]
*  Ben and I talked earlier in the show about the scary crackdown and democratic backsliding in Turkey after President Erdogan [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4499.92s)]
*  Arrested his chief political rival the mayor of Istanbul [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4508.86s)]
*  There is this massive protest movement happening as we speak trying to force Erdogan to backtrack and undo this crackdown [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4512.42s)]
*  But if he stays the course, I mean, what do you think this says about? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4519.84s)]
*  Turkey's future as a democracy and also as part of Europe. Yeah, not good. Thanks [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4524.2s)]
*  Fundamentally Turkey has for a while been what political scientists like to call sort of competitive authoritarian state [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4531.22s)]
*  Which means that it's pretty it's governed in a pretty authoritarian way, but they do have reasonably competitive elections [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4537.32s)]
*  This arrest sort of demonstrates that the government now is not even really willing to put up with those competitive [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4544.84s)]
*  Elections, which means it's sort of floating toward a Russia like pure autocracy [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4551.5s)]
*  Which certainly isn't good for the people of Turkey and it's not frankly a good precedent for other countries other democracies [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4556.82s)]
*  frankly, including our own [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4564.42s)]
*  But in terms of its acceptance into Europe, it's a pretty good moment for Turkey to do this [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4567.4800000000005s)]
*  Because the [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4573.639999999999s)]
*  Europeans really feel like they need Turkey's help in dealing with Russia and Ukraine [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4575.48s)]
*  Given that the United States seems to be a lot less reliable [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4580.96s)]
*  And of course the United States under Donald Trump doesn't really seem to care about democratic backsliding in countries like Turkey [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4584.76s)]
*  Donald Trump is talking about letting Turkey back into the f-35 [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4593.28s)]
*  program the fighter program [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4598.16s)]
*  And Erdogan the president of Turkey might visit the White House next month [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4600.42s)]
*  And I don't think any of this is really affecting that calculation. I did not know he's gonna visit [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4605.18s)]
*  Yeah, I was reading something the other day [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4609.48s)]
*  That I believe said that Turkey has the second largest [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4612.0599999999995s)]
*  Military in NATO and also has one of the most advanced [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4616.22s)]
*  defense industry sectors of any country and [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4620.9s)]
*  I mean, I I know I've read a lot recently about is a big tar like their drone company [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4624.46s)]
*  But it does sound like that a lot of countries have been increasingly reliant on Turkey's defense industry. Is that right? Yeah [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4629.700000000001s)]
*  to a degree, I mean the drones that Turkey produces were very [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4637.240000000001s)]
*  effective and important in the early part of the Ukraine War and [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4641.9800000000005s)]
*  the provision of those to Ukraine was a [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4646.5s)]
*  Big deal for the Ukrainians and the Russians were pretty pissed off about it [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4649.62s)]
*  In as the war has evolved that it's evolved past those drones and most of the drones are now made [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4654.42s)]
*  Indigenously in Ukraine and Russia is getting its own source of drones [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4661.820000000001s)]
*  But yeah, the industry remains very important [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4666.1s)]
*  The Turkish army is fairly battle-tested in Syria and in northern Iraq and is a very is a large army [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4669.08s)]
*  After the United States it may be the most effective army in in NATO [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4676.660000000001s)]
*  And so it's quite important from the European standpoint with the with the Americans in question to be able to [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4681.76s)]
*  make sure that [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4689.0s)]
*  that [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4690.68s)]
*  Turkey doesn't become too close to Russia and that Turkey's support can be counted on at least to balance against Russia in places like [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4691.660000000001s)]
*  Syria and Ukraine and that would probably be in question if they took on Turkey's [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4699.4400000000005s)]
*  domestic democracy questions at the moment. What do you think we should know about [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4706.240000000001s)]
*  Ekrem Imamolu and the CHP party that what do they stand for what's what's their political worldview? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4710.86s)]
*  Well, the CHP party is is the a long-time Turkish party. It rules for quite some time [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4716.34s)]
*  It's probably you would probably consider it a sort of slightly center-left party like a social democratic party [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4723.66s)]
*  Imamolu has been a very interesting politician the last several years. He he survived a lot of [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4731.22s)]
*  Struggles with Erdogan. He's been threatened with jail many times [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4739.12s)]
*  he he won his first he won the the [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4743.4800000000005s)]
*  First elect the first time he won the election for mayor of Istanbul. I think was in 2016 [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4748.320000000001s)]
*  He the the election was invalidated and he had to run again [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4752.92s)]
*  on completely false pretenses and [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4757.280000000001s)]
*  He then won by an even greater margin the second time. So he's a real survivor [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4759.96s)]
*  He's a very impressive politician a lot of charisma [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4764.780000000001s)]
*  And he's finally someone you feel like could beat Erdogan in a in a presidential election [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4768.5s)]
*  He's been able to reach out to the nationalists to the Kurds [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4776.46s)]
*  he's [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4781.34s)]
*  He's sufficient. He's seen as sufficiently pious to appeal to some of the people in Erdogan's base [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4782.42s)]
*  and you know, he runs this the city of Istanbul, which is a city of 16 million people and [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4788.46s)]
*  importantly [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4795.02s)]
*  The base that Erdogan used as mayor of Istanbul back in the 1990s to become [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4796.9400000000005s)]
*  Prime minister and then president so he's very dangerous politician from Erdogan's stimp [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4803.1s)]
*  Yeah, okay as I promised I'm gonna hop around the continent a bit here [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4808.18s)]
*  So Romania has been going through it the last several months [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4811.62s)]
*  The Romanian Constitutional Court annulled the presidential election after the first round of voting back in December. There were two candidates [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4814.9400000000005s)]
*  There's a center-right politician then a far-right independent named Colleen Georgezcu who rose from seemingly from obscurity quite quickly [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4822.22s)]
*  To win the first round the court then decided that Russia interference in the election was so egregious that they had to annul the results [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4830.98s)]
*  Of the first round and postpone the election [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4838.0199999999995s)]
*  They've rescheduled the election for May I believe but it barred Georgezcu from running and I guess the similar question [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4840.38s)]
*  Which is you know, how do you think Romania is balancing efforts to combat foreign interference in their election specifically Russian interference? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4848.74s)]
*  While remaining a democracy that allows free and fair elections if they're gonna just bar candidates [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4856.48s)]
*  Yeah, not well. I mean, I'm a little bit loathe to agree with JD Vance on this or almost anything [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4862.719999999999s)]
*  but I I think that there's a certain point here that [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4869.48s)]
*  That you know Romania for all of its pro-americanism [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4874.94s)]
*  And for all of its commitment to the Western camp, you know [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4879.68s)]
*  isn't a very mature democracy and isn't and has big problems with corruption and with [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4883.22s)]
*  With democracy and what you're seeing here this this idea that Russian interference was the cause of this rather obscure [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4889.94s)]
*  frankly quite nutty politician [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4898.22s)]
*  Getting [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4901.16s)]
*  23% of the vote in the first round of the election. It's a little bit difficult to stomach [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4902.6s)]
*  Of course the Russians they will they interfere everywhere [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4907.12s)]
*  But they're not actually that good at it and it's not really clear that it makes that much of a difference [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4909.320000000001s)]
*  the idea here was that [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4914.04s)]
*  Somehow their amplification on tick-tock made the difference in the election when most of Georgezcu's voters were older people who probably couldn't even find [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4916.0s)]
*  tick-tock on their phone interesting [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4924.92s)]
*  So I don't exactly believe it I think that what we're seeing here is a real challenge to [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4927.42s)]
*  Democracy is this idea that people are really pissed off about the system whatever the hell that is [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4934.66s)]
*  they feel like there's an elite that is sort of [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4940.7s)]
*  Is somewhat corrupt and is holding on to power through these elections and is rigging the system against them and they're not totally wrong [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4944.9800000000005s)]
*  Particularly in a place like Romania, but you know, you can see symptoms of this elements of this even in the United States [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4954.0s)]
*  So [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4961.88s)]
*  So I think people are pretty pissed off about that that and the Russian the Romanian attempt to sort of say well [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4963.360000000001s)]
*  This is the Russians [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4969.320000000001s)]
*  You know, we have to get our candidate in and the courts are gonna take care of it for us [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4972.0s)]
*  Can't be improving people's moods. I mean I would note that [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4977.160000000001s)]
*  He got 23% in the first round of the [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4981.0599999999995s)]
*  of the election in December, but when he was excluded from the [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4985.22s)]
*  From the new election last week. He was polling at over 50% [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4990.38s)]
*  Which does give you some sense that maybe it's it's his very exclusion [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4995.34s)]
*  It's his very it's the very way in which they're telling people that this guy who really is, you know a lunatic [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=4999.96s)]
*  He is not somebody you would ever want to be president and in my view [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5007.4s)]
*  Might have been a better idea to let him run and expose that right? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5011.44s)]
*  Then to make him into a sort of political martyr, which is what they've done. I [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5015.32s)]
*  Think there are some lessons there for everybody else. A lot of countries are struggling with this [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5020.68s)]
*  And it's very tempting to sort of say well, this is outside [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5025.64s)]
*  This is outside the pale. This is a foreign government interfering [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5029.92s)]
*  We can't let these people run we can't let these people in front of the people [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5034.64s)]
*  If you think about it that betrays a certain lack of confidence in democracy [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5039.42s)]
*  which you know might be justified but it's quite sad and it's [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5045.18s)]
*  It's not really clear that it can persist [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5049.22s)]
*  Yeah [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5051.52s)]
*  And certainly seems like it had a bit of a political strife sand effect and [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5051.9400000000005s)]
*  Help to boost him in ways that maybe running would not have I like the idea of a political strife sand [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5055.58s)]
*  Yeah, you know what Barbara's in politics, you know over here as well [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5060.22s)]
*  So maybe she would get in on this. Let's talk about my buddy our buddy Victor Orban [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5062.86s)]
*  We talk often about Hungary on the show and how the American right wing [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5068.08s)]
*  Views Orban as a model for how to crush dissent essentially in Trump's second term [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5072.799999999999s)]
*  There is now some interesting reporting about how Orban seems to be cracking down even harder [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5078.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, he feels like that kind of boot is off his neck from the Americans in particular [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5083.799999999999s)]
*  He's going after the LGBT community. He's going after pride events [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5089.12s)]
*  What are you seeing in Hungary and how do you think it's impacted by Trump's election? Yeah, I think that that's right [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5092.66s)]
*  You definitely see an uptick in Orban's rhetoric and an attempt to move [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5099.42s)]
*  Sort of further down the authoritarian ladder and it's not just the American boot that's been removed [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5105.7s)]
*  It's his sense that because he has support in Washington. He will be less constrained by Brussels [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5110.9s)]
*  and [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5118.34s)]
*  I think a very important and and frightening relationship has formed between [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5119.58s)]
*  The Trump administration and Victor Orban's regime in which they really can help each other [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5125.42s)]
*  with their respective problems, so [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5131.14s)]
*  You know the the rumor in Brussels is that [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5134.74s)]
*  Is that Orban is that the Trump people called up Orban and are telling him how to vote on? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5138.74s)]
*  On for example EU sanctions against Russia [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5145.7s)]
*  And they wanted them in this case to continue [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5149.66s)]
*  but if next if they have to vote on that every six months if six months from now the [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5152.54s)]
*  Americans decide that they don't want to use sanctions to continue [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5157.62s)]
*  They can just call their buddy Victor and he can get it done for them regardless of what the other 26 countries [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5161.0199999999995s)]
*  think meanwhile [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5166.86s)]
*  The Americans are quite helpful in protecting Orban from pushback by the European Union or by anybody else and [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5169.139999999999s)]
*  Just the sense in Hungarian or European politics that you have [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5176.46s)]
*  support from the White House means that you can you can be freer and [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5180.78s)]
*  so he's now calling his opponents in sex and he's he's really up the rhetoric in a way which [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5185.38s)]
*  You know Hungarian democracy was already in trouble. I think it's in significantly more trouble [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5192.82s)]
*  Now it's a sort of familiar story across the three each have their particularities but across the three countries [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5199.0199999999995s)]
*  We've talked about we're seeing some backsliding and all of them [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5205.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you are hearing some European leaders say well, we got to just kick Orban out [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5208.139999999999s)]
*  We got to kick Hungary out of the EU. Is there any momentum there? No, I don't think so. There's also no mechanism for that [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5213.259999999999s)]
*  and [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5220.54s)]
*  It would be a real admission defeat. One of the things that they're doing right now is they're calling for sort of [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5221.82s)]
*  Decisions at 26 or 27 members of the EU and and it's true that particularly on issues like Ukraine [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5228.38s)]
*  they do have [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5236.3s)]
*  Hungary stands out. It's an outlier on [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5239.82s)]
*  particularly on Ukraine but on a bunch of European Union issues and and they've kind of come up with a procedure where they issue [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5242.62s)]
*  conclusions at 26 and they sort of ignore the raving lunatic in the corner of the room and they can do that for [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5249.26s)]
*  More things than you would think because they're because the European Union does operate by some norms [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5256.179999999999s)]
*  But they but on the key votes that require unanimity such as the sanctions vote. I mentioned earlier they can't [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5262.0599999999995s)]
*  Do that and I think that they're in particular because of Trump taking power [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5268.74s)]
*  They're losing leverage over over Orban rate rather than gaining it. Yeah [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5274.58s)]
*  Speaking of the impact of Trump. I mean the Germans recently made some [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5280.299999999999s)]
*  Changes in terms of how they manage their debt [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5283.76s)]
*  This will allow them to spend domestically to stimulate the economy, but also invest a lot in their own defense capabilities [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5286.36s)]
*  Can you just give us like the quick and dirty on the I think it's a so-called debt break change and how meaningful you think [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5294.32s)]
*  It will be for NATO and European defense capabilities generally to have this [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5300.7s)]
*  reinvigorated German military [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5306.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know it has the possibility to be a really big a really big deal [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5308.2s)]
*  The [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5315.44s)]
*  Germans are interesting [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5316.88s)]
*  I mean they are they're the country with that has a tremendous amount of what they call fiscal space in [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5318.16s)]
*  Europe because they've been very [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5324.72s)]
*  German over the years very prudent in their spending [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5327.28s)]
*  they have a [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5331.24s)]
*  debt to GDP ratio of roughly 30 35 percent which is [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5332.96s)]
*  You know, the American one is 90 [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5338.2s)]
*  The European Union guideline is 60 and most countries exceed it [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5341.32s)]
*  And they have a you know, spectacular credit rating. So basically [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5346.599999999999s)]
*  They can borrow practically unlimited funds at [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5352.28s)]
*  At very low interest rates and they haven't taken advantage of that in recent years because they've become you know [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5356.28s)]
*  arguably to German [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5363.76s)]
*  and [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5365.88s)]
*  So I think the the fear of American abandonment and the and the increasing sense of threat from Russia [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5367.36s)]
*  As well as frankly fears of loss of German competitiveness because they haven't really been [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5374.2s)]
*  Mobilizing much public investment in the last decade [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5381.84s)]
*  and I just came back from living in Germany for a little over two years and [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5384.759999999999s)]
*  It's it's not dissimilar from the United States, but you can feel a lot of stuff sort of falling apart [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5389.28s)]
*  So [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5394.639999999999s)]
*  They have finally decided [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5395.88s)]
*  They had what was called the debt break as you mentioned, which was a constitutional provision [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5398.679999999999s)]
*  Which limited their ability to run deficits? They they threw a very complicated parliamentary maneuver [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5403.88s)]
*  Got mostly got rid of that debt break and pushed and pushed [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5410.84s)]
*  What appears to be about 500 billion euros? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5415.719999999999s)]
*  At least in the initial phase [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5420.24s)]
*  In the initial phase to [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5422.48s)]
*  Both defense spending and investment and then they had to bribe the Green Party with a hundred billion in [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5425.28s)]
*  In spending on climate change issues [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5432.12s)]
*  So this is an enormous amount of money by any standard if they really spend it and if they spend it wisely on [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5435.719999999999s)]
*  Infrastructure and wisely on good defense investments. It could completely change [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5443.32s)]
*  German power [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5448.76s)]
*  But that wisely [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5450.76s)]
*  Adverb is a is a difficult one for them to meet and they have they you know [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5453.68s)]
*  They they did a sort of mini one of these last right after the Russian invasion where they said they were gonna spend a hundred billion euros [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5458.4400000000005s)]
*  I think they by and large did spend it but they didn't spend it very well and it wasn't it didn't make much difference [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5465.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so they so that the [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5471.280000000001s)]
*  The issue is not over but this is this is an impressive [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5474.48s)]
*  Move and we particularly from a leader hasn't even taken office yet and [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5478.2s)]
*  We should be watching it very carefully. Yeah, it was quite impressive politics [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5482.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, I guess there's also the question of where they're gonna spend this money [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5486.799999999999s)]
*  There's been a bunch of reporting on how Europe wants to wean itself off of American weapons and weapons systems [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5490.679999999999s)]
*  My understanding is that you know, I think it's a little easier to see [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5497.959999999999s)]
*  Is that you know, I think it's a little easier said than done [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5501.64s)]
*  These you're often talking about like complicated interoperable systems like, you know [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5505.84s)]
*  a radar and missile defense or systems that need constant maintenance like the f-35 that you mentioned earlier [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5510.54s)]
*  How realistic do you think it is for Europe to wean itself off of? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5516.320000000001s)]
*  The US, you know military industrial complex. Yeah. Well wean is the right term. I mean [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5521.8s)]
*  There there are lots of alternatives [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5527.84s)]
*  There's a lot of possibility to build up defense industrial base in Germany and in other European [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5530.56s)]
*  Countries, there are lots of other [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5536.72s)]
*  Even buyers to buy from I think it's very important for them to make that choice [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5539.12s)]
*  You're right that it won't be something you do overnight [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5544.400000000001s)]
*  It's the work of ten years [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5547.76s)]
*  Probably but it's certainly doable [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5550.28s)]
*  it's just that the big thing is you have to decide to do it and [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5553.360000000001s)]
*  Right now the Germans are still debating amongst themselves whether this spending is to replace the Americans or to entice the Americans to stay [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5556.679999999999s)]
*  and that [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5566.599999999999s)]
*  Because actually in theory both things require money, right? Trump is saying [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5568.719999999999s)]
*  Trump is saying we need you to spend more. Oh, we're not going to defend you [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5572.8s)]
*  And so the idea there is well, let's spend more and then he'll stay it and or or alternatively [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5576.96s)]
*  He could be leaving and then you'd have to say well we need to spend money because there's nobody there [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5583.24s)]
*  but the that both of those things require that this type of spending program but they but they dictate very different ways that you [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5587.679999999999s)]
*  Spend it and that's I think the key thing to be looking at if the Germans make [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5595.84s)]
*  concerted efforts again slow gradual weaning efforts to [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5601.36s)]
*  Start to reinvigorate there and the European defense industrial base and to move away from American weapons [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5606.88s)]
*  Then you'll understand that they are trying to [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5613.24s)]
*  Substitute for the Americans, but if they just keep buying [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5617.0s)]
*  F-35s and you know, frankly if you have 500 billion to waste there's no better way to waste it than on the f-35 [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5620.719999999999s)]
*  Then then we'll know that what they're trying to do basically is bribe America to keep defending them [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5628.5599999999995s)]
*  And I think that would be a very bad idea for those sons. Yes somewhere a [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5634.3s)]
*  generation of acquisition folks of the Pentagon is nodding along with you there [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5638.5599999999995s)]
*  final question for you [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5642.6s)]
*  Georgia Maloney the prime minister of Italy has been an interesting character to watch when she was elected [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5645.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, there was all these ties about kind of being like ties to Mussolini or being a Mussolini fan [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5651.04s)]
*  She seemed like a traditional far-right populist who would demograph [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5657.0s)]
*  Migration and go along that sort of well-worn path, but she's also been very pro-ukraine [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5661.4800000000005s)]
*  she's kind of [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5667.68s)]
*  Given the finger to the Trump administration or to Elon Musk a couple times [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5669.32s)]
*  She's just sort of like played an interesting done a plint interesting political dance [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5673.0599999999995s)]
*  And I wonder what you make of her and the the position she's sort of taken on the world stage [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5677.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, I agree that she's fascinating and you know to be honest with you. I think she is more or less a traditional populist [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5683.5599999999995s)]
*  Certainly when it comes to her immigration stance and when it comes to her anti-elite message [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5691.5199999999995s)]
*  And when it comes to her basic nationalism [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5696.64s)]
*  but I think what she is above all is a very very impressive politician and [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5700.56s)]
*  I think when you're prime minister of Italy you have to balance a whole bunch of different considerations [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5706.68s)]
*  And I think what we're seeing in Georgia Maloney is not that someone who seemed to be a populist wasn't but that power [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5713.64s)]
*  socializes you [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5721.52s)]
*  And that actually and this is you know, maybe a lesson for the Romanians or some or somebody else is that [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5723.08s)]
*  You know middle-sized European countries can't do anything that everything they want. They have to deal with the European Union [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5730.0s)]
*  They have to deal with the United States [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5736.7s)]
*  They have to deal with a population that doesn't that you know [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5738.46s)]
*  Once you're in power isn't just interested in in whether you like Russia or not [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5742.16s)]
*  They're interested in you delivering the goods and you know liking Russia is not a way of delivering the goods economically that [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5746.32s)]
*  For that if you're an Italian politician, you have to be you have to have a good relationship with the European Union [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5753.04s)]
*  You have to have a good relationship with the United States [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5758.2s)]
*  and so she has I think been quite deft in [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5761.6s)]
*  being able to [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5766.2s)]
*  stay true [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5768.08s)]
*  in a basic way to her populist roots, but also [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5769.48s)]
*  govern the country in a way that can conceivably deliver the goods and that's that's moderated her from the standpoint of [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5773.96s)]
*  Of [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5780.88s)]
*  Liberals in Europe and in the United States [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5782.96s)]
*  I don't think she's exactly any different than she ever was [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5785.6s)]
*  But I think she is finding that it's very easy to run [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5790.6s)]
*  As a populist it's a lot harder to govern as a populist and we're seeing this everywhere across the world like populists [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5795.76s)]
*  Don't really have governing programs. They have opposition programs [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5802.32s)]
*  Which she has done is demonstrate how you can change from an oppositional pop-up populist to a governing [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5806.719999999999s)]
*  Populist and that does that's a little bit comforting actually [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5814.48s)]
*  Amongst all the bad news stories we've been talking about and there are a lot of them including here domestically a lot of bad news [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5818.839999999999s)]
*  Jeremy, thank you so much for just hopping around the continent with me. This has been fascinating. It was a nice trip [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5825.12s)]
*  Maybe next time we'll go to some nice response. Maybe we can just park in Paris with Macron [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5831.56s)]
*  Maybe we build an international peacekeeping force in London. Yeah, I feel like if we've done this from a cafe in Rome [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5835.64s)]
*  Listen, I don't know where you're located currently, but tell me when and where and I'll be there [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5842.96s)]
*  Thanks for doing this. It was fun. Thanks again to Jeremy Shapiro for doing the show and [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5848.72s)]
*  Talk to you guys soon [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5853.08s)]
*  You [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFTetKA3fE&t=5860.6s)]
