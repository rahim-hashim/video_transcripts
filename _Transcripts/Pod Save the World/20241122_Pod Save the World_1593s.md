# Malala Yousafzai on Afghan Women Resisting the Taliban & Amplifying Their Voices in New Documentary
**Pod Save the World:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo)
*  There is a clip in this documentary where we see a little girl and she's raising her voice, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=0.0s)]
*  challenging all of us. What are we doing? Why can a girl not be in school? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=6.44s)]
*  Why can a woman not be going to work? And I could see my little self in her. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=11.44s)]
*  And I think we're not able to answer the questions that we're getting from Afghan girls and Afghan women. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  And that is the push that I feel that wakes me up every day and pushes me to do my activism for Afghan women and girls. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=24.6s)]
*  And I will highlight that this is the activism that is led by Afghan women and girls. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=34.400000000000006s)]
*  We are here as their sisters, as their supporters, and we're using all the tools and the opportunities and platforms [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=40.72s)]
*  we have to bring attention to what is happening in the country. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=49.36s)]
*  And it is purely on these human principles and on the principle of humanity. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=52.8s)]
*  And I really hope that we can show as much resilience as the Afghan women are showing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=61.24s)]
*  You can clearly see in this documentary that the Afghan women are not resting for a single day to keep fighting for their right [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=68.8s)]
*  to work and education. And they're putting their lives at risk because they do not see a future under the oppression of the Taliban. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=79.16s)]
*  Laga Khan, Lada Bash. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=87.8s)]
*  The Taliban told us to stay at home. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=95.44s)]
*  They don't have the right to work, they don't have the right to education. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  And they don't know that they're going to be able to do what they want. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=106.0s)]
*  OK, so since the fall of Kabul and the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in August of 2021, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=108.96s)]
*  we've watched as the situation for women and girls in Afghanistan has beyond deteriorated. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=117.0s)]
*  It's kind of collapsed. Women are not allowed to go to school, to go to work, to speak in public. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=123.24s)]
*  And there's an incredibly important and powerful new documentary film, Bread and Roses, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=130.04s)]
*  which shows the drastic changes taken place since the collapse of Kabul and the withdrawal of American and coalition forces. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=136.12s)]
*  And so today I'm very pleased to be joined by the director of this film, Bread and Roses, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=143.96s)]
*  Saar Rahmani, as well as the executive producer, Mullahullah Yousafzai, who, of course, runs the Mullahullah Fund, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  the world's youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=157.36s)]
*  And before we start our conversation, I just want to note the film starts, premieres on Apple TV. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=160.20000000000002s)]
*  So it should be widely accessible on November 22nd. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  And I really, really encourage people to see it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=167.72s)]
*  But thank you for joining us to talk about this. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=172.08s)]
*  So, Saar, I want to start with you as a filmmaker, as an Afghan woman. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=173.51999999999998s)]
*  When did you decide to make this film and how did you find these characters, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  the women who really got us through their experiences as a vehicle for telling the story? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  When the Kabul collapse, I had to travel out of Afghanistan to attend a film festival in Europe a few days before the Kabul collapse. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  So then I didn't have any idea that I will not be able to go back to Afghanistan. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=202.24s)]
*  So when this happened, I was witnessing how the situation of women and girls are become so harsh and difficult, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=209.28s)]
*  especially for the women who were the only breadwinner of their families. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=218.32000000000002s)]
*  So I thought, what can I do? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=222.84s)]
*  And then I find out that I can start working with the charities who are supporting women in this situation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=225.32s)]
*  Then we provide women with urgent needs. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=233.2s)]
*  So after sometimes they start sending me video about their daily lives and how they organizing meeting for doing [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=237.44s)]
*  administration in the Kabul street and asking for their rights. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=247.24s)]
*  So later on, I find out that they actually they trusted me as a filmmaker to raise their voice in larger scale than just simply documenting. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=250.44s)]
*  I was very lucky and it was by chance that Jennifer Lawrence expressed her willingness to support this project. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=264.48s)]
*  And then later on, Malala, I join us and then we build a team on the ground. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=272.76s)]
*  We train several protagonists how to filming their daily lives with their cell phone. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=278.08s)]
*  And we had cameraman and camera women on the ground to support them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=284.52s)]
*  And then I had huge archive of Kabul city that I was shooting myself a year before for another purpose that it's fit the story in editing room. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=289.64s)]
*  And that's how the journey started. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=300.6s)]
*  I have to say, just to note that the scenes of Kabul are absolutely breathtaking, beautiful and shows the humanity of a place that people in the United States have seen through the prism of war. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=303.08s)]
*  So these these women, they're remarkable stories because so people understand these are exactly the kind of women that were inspiring, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=316.0s)]
*  I think, to people around the world in terms of the transformations that have taken place over the course of the previous 20 years. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you have a successful dentist, you have someone who worked for the government, you have an activist. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=333.84000000000003s)]
*  How did you train them or show them how to film their lives? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=340.4s)]
*  And they're also participating in various forms of protest against the government because you obviously worry for these women as you're watching it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=346.76s)]
*  How did you and they manage the risk? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=354.88s)]
*  Because I imagine if the Taliban knew they were filming a movie like this, they'd be in danger. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  First of all, they didn't went to Kabul Street for our film. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=363.15999999999997s)]
*  They were already there and they were already sending shooting their life and sharing with with social media and so many journalists. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=367.64s)]
*  Some of this material, they send it to me. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=378.2s)]
*  They also send it to other media, too, which is really brave and a brave act of them that to share their daily life with media to that everyone understand what exactly happening there. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  So but we did some kind of training how to send the material and how to take care of themselves to that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=394.64s)]
*  If they are arrested by Taliban and they find out about their cell phone, we they face less risk. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=404.4s)]
*  So but I have to say that if I want to make this film now today, it's impossible because as Malala mentioned it, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=414.52s)]
*  Taliban is imposed more. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=425.64s)]
*  It is a decrease against women since that time and the situation getting more difficult and it's impossible to do it right now. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  So I was I think I was very lucky that Jennifer Lawrence expressed her willingness to make a film about Afghan women that time. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=441.84s)]
*  Otherwise, we even didn't have this movie by now. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, because you captured the deterioration, you know, you can feel over the course, you know, even the beginning, the movie begins on the day that the Taliban comes into Kabul. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=454.6s)]
*  And there's still almost like a it's certainly not a hopefulness, but a there's a kind of belief of protest. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=465.68s)]
*  And and by the end of it, you feel like there's just no space for that anymore. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=473.52s)]
*  Malala, you've been very outspoken about issues, obviously, over a long period of time about around education. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=478.35999999999996s)]
*  But you really focused on Afghan women and girls since the collapse of Kabul. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=485.08s)]
*  I wanted to ask you, given all of your advocacy over the years, what what is the role of storytelling in advocacy and activism? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=489.88s)]
*  You're someone who talks to politicians, you're someone who works with NGOs. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=499.28s)]
*  This is a different kind of activism. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=503.64s)]
*  Why did you believe that storytelling needed to be a part of what you're doing? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=506.04s)]
*  I became an activist at age 11 and I had no training in how to be an activist. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=510.92s)]
*  The only tool that I had was to share my own story. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=516.2s)]
*  And at that time, girls education was banned for girls in my hometown by the Taliban from and they took control from 2007 to 2009. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=521.16s)]
*  Right now, when I look at the situation that Afghan women and girls are witnessing, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=533.12s)]
*  it is so important for us to bring attention to their stories that they are telling us in their own way, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=536.96s)]
*  because the Taliban do not want us to talk about this topic. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=542.36s)]
*  They want us to look away. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=545.88s)]
*  And we all are aware how the news cycle works. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=547.36s)]
*  This issue might pop up once once in a while. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=550.48s)]
*  And there's rarely any discussion about what the life of a girl actually looks like and what women are going through right now. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=553.96s)]
*  The Taliban have imposed systematic oppression on Afghan women and girls where they have issued more than 100 decrees in edicts, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=561.64s)]
*  majority of which are targeting women and girls, limiting them from work, education and any form of political participation or presence in public life. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=570.56s)]
*  Afghan women activists and other human rights defenders are calling it a gender apartheid. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  Because just because of a group's gender, they're living a completely different life, not being treated as equal citizens. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=585.08s)]
*  And if they dare to even seek these human rights and basic things, they're being punished for it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=592.5200000000001s)]
*  They're being beaten up and put in jails and harassed. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=598.72s)]
*  This is the price that women are paying right now for simply wanting to be in school or having the opportunity to do work for which they had fought really hard. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=603.4000000000001s)]
*  Right now, they are trying to use every tool, every opportunity that they can get to raise their voice. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=613.12s)]
*  They're using social media to bring attention to what is happening. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=620.28s)]
*  They also volunteered in Step 4 to share their story through Bread and Roses, this documentary. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=624.16s)]
*  And the three women, working women, did it because they are doing it on behalf of the 20 million Afghan women and girls who are being abused. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=630.52s)]
*  They did it on behalf of the 20 million Afghan women and girls who we may never meet, may never see. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=640.2s)]
*  They're hoping that they put their lives at risk so that we start thinking about the rest of Afghan women and do something for them. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=645.48s)]
*  So storytelling and all of these different forms of activism are so critical and are giving us a sense of hope in this time. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=652.2s)]
*  Well, you mentioned the gender apartheid effort. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=659.36s)]
*  We recently, or a couple of times, we've had Sahar Halamzai, who works at Malala Fund with you, on to talk about this effort. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=661.44s)]
*  This is an effort to codify gender apartheid as a crime against humanity, to create some accountability and some international tools to treat gender apartheid in the same way that racial apartheid is treated under the law. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  Where does that effort stand? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=684.88s)]
*  I know that you're part of an effort to get more and more countries to sign on. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=686.4s)]
*  There are votes coming in the UN system. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=690.1999999999999s)]
*  Where does that effort stand and what do you hope advancing this idea of gender apartheid could do for women in Afghanistan and other places? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=693.36s)]
*  I started as a young activist, and for me, the question has always been around, why is this happening? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=702.04s)]
*  How could the Taliban be in control once again and impose the same restriction? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=708.8000000000001s)]
*  And this continues to happen for three and a half years, and yet we are falling short of ways in which we can hold them accountable. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=714.88s)]
*  For me, it is accountability. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=722.7199999999999s)]
*  They need to be questioned. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=724.1999999999999s)]
*  They need to be brought to justice. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=725.3199999999999s)]
*  And looking at the current international system, words like gender discrimination and gender persecution actually fall short in describing the scale of the oppression that Afghan women are facing under the Taliban. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's why this conversation around gender apartheid became so important to me. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=742.9599999999999s)]
*  And this is something that has been led by women, including Afghan women. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=747.96s)]
*  And this was even brought up back in the time of the first Taliban government. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=753.12s)]
*  This is giving a sense of hope, because if we can make gender apartheid a part of the Crime Against Humanity Treaty and it gets codified, this would give a sense of hope to women in Afghanistan that the Taliban will be held accountable, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=759.0s)]
*  that the countries who are complicit in supporting the Taliban will also be held accountable, and that there would be more pressure on leaders to feel like they have a responsibility. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  Right now, so many of them are just getting away by ignoring this topic, not talking about it. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  And so I do believe that this is giving a sense of hope to women in Afghanistan, but also around the world. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=789.0s)]
*  It is giving a sense of protection. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=795.48s)]
*  And for me, it's the hope that it does not happen again. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=797.64s)]
*  I was 11 years old when girls education was banned. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=804.68s)]
*  At 15, the Taliban tried to attack me. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=807.96s)]
*  Sahara remembers the time when the Taliban had taken control back in 1996. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=811.16s)]
*  This is not happening for the first time. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=818.68s)]
*  Nobody was expecting that the Taliban would be back in power in 2021. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=821.92s)]
*  And we all know they have not changed. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=825.36s)]
*  They are the same Taliban. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  They are even more oppressive than before. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=828.6800000000001s)]
*  And if we don't have the right system of accountability in place, this will keep happening again and again. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=833.72s)]
*  And Afghan women, they fight so hard and they lose everything all over again. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=840.08s)]
*  So for me, that's why the gender apartheid campaign is so critical to be supported. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=844.84s)]
*  But there's one more question I want to ask both of you about the kind of policy dimension of this, which is [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=849.24s)]
*  there's a debate about whether to try to make things a little bit better through negotiation with the Taliban, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=854.4399999999999s)]
*  you know, in exchange for more formal diplomatic recognition or some form of relief from sanctions [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=861.56s)]
*  to try to negotiate improvements. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=869.52s)]
*  And then there's some people who say that's a futile effort. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=871.68s)]
*  The Taliban, this is their ideology. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=874.8s)]
*  This is who they are. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=876.84s)]
*  And so we have to focus more on just accountability and taking kind of a longer view. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=878.04s)]
*  I'm curious what you both think about this question of whether to pursue diplomacy or whether that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=883.56s)]
*  that is kind of doomed to fail or maybe you pursue it anyway and it's doomed to fail. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=891.56s)]
*  But I'm curious where you come down on that question. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=896.4399999999999s)]
*  I believe that any negotiations or peace talks with the Taliban should not be done in the absence of women. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=898.6s)]
*  This is a real question to us because we are talking about our commitment to gender equality and the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=907.4s)]
*  importance of women in the room. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=916.36s)]
*  But when it comes to how the situation for Afghanistan is treated, it is completely heartbreaking. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=919.32s)]
*  It was not that long ago in June this year that the Taliban's demand of excluding women [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=924.84s)]
*  from the Doha talks was accepted. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=930.92s)]
*  And UN representatives agreed to sit down with the Taliban and women's rights was not even a priority [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=932.92s)]
*  on the agenda. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=939.16s)]
*  And Afghan women were told you cannot be in those discussions. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=939.96s)]
*  I don't think any sort of engagement that excludes Afghan women is helpful. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=945.32s)]
*  And it is actually not in service of the country because women are half of the population. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=950.68s)]
*  And there is no hope for a better future for Afghanistan if half of the population is living [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=956.36s)]
*  under an oppression and they're not getting education, they cannot do work. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=961.5600000000001s)]
*  I would highlight that it is so critical that in any engagements, Afghan women are included. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=966.68s)]
*  I'm not going to debate about whether engagement should happen or not. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=973.96s)]
*  But I do know that the engagements have to be principled engagements. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=977.4s)]
*  And the people whose future is determined through those conversations have to be in the room. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=982.1999999999999s)]
*  So that's why the civil society, the minorities, the different ethnic groups, and specifically [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=986.68s)]
*  women, have to be in those rooms. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=993.56s)]
*  And women's rights and girls' education have to be in non-negotiable condition. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=996.04s)]
*  Why is that even being debated? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1000.04s)]
*  It's a human right. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1002.1999999999999s)]
*  And if the Taliban cannot guarantee that, how do we expect them to be treating women any better? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1003.24s)]
*  And the other thing is that in the beginning, countries were saying, or some people had this [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1010.28s)]
*  view that we should give the Taliban some time, they're different, they have changed. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1016.36s)]
*  Now three and a half years later, the Taliban have already proven to us who they are [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1020.92s)]
*  and how extreme their ideologies are. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1025.64s)]
*  Until now, they have issued more than 100 decrees in edicts limiting women. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1027.96s)]
*  I think that is enough evidence out there for us that the Taliban, even if you sit down with them, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1032.1200000000001s)]
*  we should not be accepting ifs and buts and all of that, and really challenge them and say that [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1039.8s)]
*  there is no conversation going ahead if women's rights are not guaranteed and girls' education [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1045.56s)]
*  is not given. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1050.1200000000001s)]
*  And I hope that you will be able to see that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1051.32s)]
*  And I hope that we do not fall into this argument that sometimes comes from their side, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1055.72s)]
*  that those who are sympathizing with them saying that, oh, it's culture, religion. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1063.24s)]
*  It's none of that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1068.1999999999998s)]
*  The true representatives of the Afghan culture are the Afghan women and the Afghan people [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1069.48s)]
*  themselves. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1073.48s)]
*  And Afghan women within that culture have been fighting so hard to get their education. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1074.36s)]
*  And the education system is already in line with the culture. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1078.84s)]
*  And then with the religion, again, I'm still trying to figure out how the Taliban in three [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1082.52s)]
*  and a half years cannot figure out what a more Islamic education looks like. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  There are a dozen of Muslim countries in the world, and in none of those Muslim countries, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1092.92s)]
*  girls are prohibited from access to school or women are systematically prohibited from work. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1097.48s)]
*  So the Taliban are completely abusing the power that they have using these as excuses. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1103.24s)]
*  And I believe when it comes to the protection of women's rights, none of these excuses should [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1108.4399999999998s)]
*  be accepted. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1113.56s)]
*  That should not even be a conversation. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1114.28s)]
*  And these should be non-negotiable condition. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1116.36s)]
*  And that makes the gender apartheid campaign also quite important. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1119.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1123.08s)]
*  Sarah, so just to put it a slightly different way to you too, and I just want to echo what [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1123.8799999999999s)]
*  you said. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1128.04s)]
*  I want to acknowledge as someone who's in the US government for part of this 20 years [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1128.84s)]
*  after 9-11, if I look back at the single biggest thing that we did wrong, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1133.08s)]
*  it's not even just one matter of policy. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1138.9199999999998s)]
*  But when I was there, we have these conversations and these meetings about policy in Afghanistan, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1141.6399999999999s)]
*  and there were not Afghans in those rooms. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1148.6799999999998s)]
*  And part of what's so powerful about this film is that you're hearing directly the lived [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1152.4399999999998s)]
*  experience. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1158.28s)]
*  These women that were so fascinating to watch and so inspiring to watch took these risks to protest. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1160.12s)]
*  And presumably now most of them are out of the country. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1167.0s)]
*  But I'm curious what, Sarah, what they would think about how to change things. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1171.0s)]
*  Because clearly they were protesting in part just out of frustration, but probably also out of a [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1178.76s)]
*  belief that someone needed to protest to have any hope of things getting better. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1183.24s)]
*  How do you think that the women whose stories you told and from your own perspective, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1187.56s)]
*  what's the best way to try to think about how to change this? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1192.36s)]
*  The most challenging part of making this film was emotionally, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1195.56s)]
*  that because we were facing with the deep human story of loss, resilience, and hope. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1200.28s)]
*  And Afghan women, they never lost their hope and they keep fighting. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1207.56s)]
*  So, and it was very important for us to tell their stories with authenticity and respect. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1212.36s)]
*  And in this situation, when we decide, the world decide to replace Taliban by Taliban, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1218.44s)]
*  and then since three years and a half Taliban doing everything to prove that they are the same [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1225.88s)]
*  Taliban, and we are keep denying saying the Taliban change. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1231.64s)]
*  And I don't know when we will accept it that Taliban are the same terrorists that we were [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1236.76s)]
*  considering them as international terrorists for many years. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1242.36s)]
*  And then suddenly we decide to hand it part of our world to the terrorists and what we [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1246.36s)]
*  expecting from this situation. So we have to think deeply that if Afghan women are paying the price, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1253.0s)]
*  high price, now today, we might pay the price tomorrow. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1261.24s)]
*  If we want to make a decision and bring some change to the situation, it's good to make a [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1266.12s)]
*  decision now today and not more waste time on this what we're going to do with the Taliban. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1271.64s)]
*  So I think, and also it's not about women and education, it's about all the artists. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1280.1200000000001s)]
*  In Afghanistan, there is filmmaking considered as a crime. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1286.3600000000001s)]
*  Musicians are not able to express themselves. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1290.44s)]
*  So in this situation, Taliban are keep radicalizing young men and boys to take them as a next [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1295.0s)]
*  soldier, and they're growing really. Do people thinking about that is dangerous for our world? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1305.8799999999999s)]
*  Or they still thinking this is Afghan women issues and is not linking to the rest of the world? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1314.12s)]
*  So this is some matter that we have to consider it seriously, I believe. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1321.0s)]
*  Well, one last question I want to ask you, Malala, which is, right now, it's very difficult [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1326.92s)]
*  in global politics. We're here in the United States, we've had an election, probably a lot of people [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1332.2s)]
*  in our audience are not happy about the result, but it's nowhere nearly as dire circumstances [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  as in places like Afghanistan. But even to return the Taliban, it feels like [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1344.3600000000001s)]
*  this thing that people couldn't conceive happened and it happened. And we see the rise of a kind [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1348.76s)]
*  of a nationalist brand of politics around the world. But yet you continue to do this work [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1353.8799999999999s)]
*  and motivate many people around the world. I'm sure there are things you'd even rather be doing [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1361.3999999999999s)]
*  than doing a round of interviews in a hotel, but you do it. And the question I want to ask you is, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1366.84s)]
*  what keeps you going? What keeps you motivated to keep working for that change in things or [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1373.0s)]
*  that change in attitudes or that change in norms or that moment in global politics when [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1379.24s)]
*  the winds might shift in a better direction? What keeps you going? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1383.56s)]
*  There is a clip in this documentary where we see a little girl and she's raising her voice, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1387.32s)]
*  challenging all of us. What are we doing? Why can a girl not be in school? Why can a woman not be [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1393.56s)]
*  going to work? And I could see my little self in her. And I think we're not able to answer [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1400.28s)]
*  the questions that we are getting from Afghan girls and Afghan women. And that is the push that [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1407.8s)]
*  I feel that wakes me up every day and pushes me to do my activism for Afghan women and girls. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1414.68s)]
*  And I will highlight that this is the activism that is led by Afghan women and girls. We are here as [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1421.48s)]
*  their sisters, as their supporters, and we're using all the tools and the opportunities and [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1429.32s)]
*  platforms we have to bring attention to what is happening in the country. And it is purely on these [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1435.96s)]
*  human principles and on the principle of humanity. And I really hope that we can show as much [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1442.76s)]
*  resilience as the Afghan women are showing. You can clearly see in this documentary that [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1453.0s)]
*  the Afghan women are not resting for a single day to keep fighting for their right to work [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1459.3999999999999s)]
*  and education. And they're putting their lives at risk because they do not see a future under the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1466.9199999999998s)]
*  oppression of the Taliban. And they know that it's worth fighting for, to see the day when they can [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1472.9199999999998s)]
*  be living under a non-Taliban government where they can practice their rights once again and [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1480.04s)]
*  they can be back to work, they can be getting their education. And still it's that hope and [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1487.4s)]
*  dream for me that schools can reopen and Afghan girls can have the rights that girls in other parts [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1491.96s)]
*  of the world have. And in this time, I want to say that the Taliban are using everything that they [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1498.44s)]
*  can to silence women. To resist them, we have to uplift the voices of Afghan women. The Taliban are [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1505.8000000000002s)]
*  attempting to erase women from public life and make them invisible. Making the stories of Afghan [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1514.76s)]
*  women visible is a form of resistance against the Taliban. And I see this documentary a part of that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1520.36s)]
*  resistance and activism that Afghan women are leading in opposition of the Taliban. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1526.84s)]
*  Well, look, that's an incredibly powerful note. And I'm glad you raised the children because [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1533.24s)]
*  in a way that I was kind of haunted by these children because in some ways it's a movie about [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1538.6s)]
*  them, you know, as much as it's about the women you're profiling. And they're so full of life and [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1544.6s)]
*  and incredulity about the rights being denied them. So I really encourage people to watch [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1551.32s)]
*  Bread and Roses. It's on Apple TV starting November 22nd. Sara, thank you for making such a powerful [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpWXX_gwQzo&t=1558.28s)]
