Video Description: Tommy and Ben discuss the international reaction to Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential race, and dive into what Kamala Harris’s foreign policy could look like based on her record in the Senate, experience during the Biden administration, and advisers. They also talk about Netanyahu’s visit to Washington and planned speech to Congress, resignations of Senator Robert Menendez and the head of the Secret Service, deadly protests in Bangladesh, updates from the EU, and how to escape from a cocaine shark. Then, Tommy speaks with Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian about the 10 year anniversary of his imprisonment in Iran, and what the US government could be doing now to get more hostages home from Russia and Hamas.

*  on the rise of fascism around the world. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=244.42000000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=247.34s)]
*  Timely. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  So we look at, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=249.34s)]
*  basically trying to understand Trump [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=250.9s)]
*  in the context of all these other leaders, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=252.54000000000002s)]
*  what we talk about in the show a lot, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=254.62s)]
*  Orban, Putin, all these other guys. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=255.78s)]
*  When does a populist become a fascist? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=259.26s)]
*  Why are all these guys there at the same time? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=261.9s)]
*  What are the risks here? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=263.46s)]
*  What's the history of the Republican parties [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=264.46s)]
*  and the American rights? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=266.62s)]
*  Kind of weird fascination with strongman politics. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=267.46s)]
*  So if you were inclined to check it out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=270.09999999999997s)]
*  Can I say something dorky? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=274.02s)]
*  Permission to dork? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=275.06s)]
*  I just mentioned the New York Review of Books. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=275.9s)]
*  So I think we've crossed that threshold. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=277.46s)]
*  I find the New York Review of Books [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=279.26s)]
*  to be kind of like an enigmatic publication for me. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=281.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=283.3s)]
*  Because the title makes you think [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=284.14s)]
*  that they're just telling you about some new book [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=285.26s)]
*  that comes out, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=287.02s)]
*  but then people are always writing original pieces for them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=287.86s)]
*  But they're also very paywalled. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=289.82s)]
*  So it's hard to get more detail. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=291.5s)]
*  They are paywalled. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=292.34s)]
*  Yeah, I will preface this by saying they're paywalled. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=293.18s)]
*  I am reviewing two books. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=295.62s)]
*  One called, One to be Fascist, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=297.46s)]
*  one called America Last. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=298.56s)]
*  One to be Fascist is about kind of like [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=299.86s)]
*  what the trend is that's happening in the world. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=301.54s)]
*  America Last is interesting. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=303.86s)]
*  It's about the history, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=304.94s)]
*  like the last century essentially, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=305.86s)]
*  the American right having this fascination [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=308.46s)]
*  with like strong men, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=310.42s)]
*  which is an interesting tour. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=311.86s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=313.58s)]
*  Like sometimes you open it [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=314.42s)]
*  and there's like somebody's reviewing like nine books [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=315.86s)]
*  and like a movie or something. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=318.14s)]
*  And then just kind of writing an essay. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=319.94s)]
*  But I love it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=320.9s)]
*  I've always like nerded out on it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=321.74s)]
*  And I'm just gonna plug, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=322.82s)]
*  the editor is awesome. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=324.3s)]
*  She's Emily Greenhouse. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=325.26s)]
*  She's like, I hesitate to say our age, you know? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=326.68s)]
*  Like it's fun to like have a peer [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=329.38s)]
*  who's like running one of these things. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=331.34s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=332.58s)]
*  It's good. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=333.42s)]
*  They're doing good stuff over there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=334.24s)]
*  Did you see the clip that went viral [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=335.1s)]
*  like the other week on, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=337.1s)]
*  I think it was on Twitter mostly, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=339.52s)]
*  of George Bush decrying like strong men [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=340.7s)]
*  and America first ideology in tariffs [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  and talking about how we- [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=346.26s)]
*  Speaking like cogently. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=347.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's like sort of predicting the future of Trump. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=348.1s)]
*  Yeah, I did see that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=351.06s)]
*  Oh man, that guy's making sense now. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=351.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=353.62s)]
*  That's troubling. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  Okay, but let's start with President Biden [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=355.62s)]
*  because he made this momentous decision to step back. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=357.82000000000005s)]
*  Not surprisingly, US allies sung his praises. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=361.42s)]
*  Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the UK, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=364.92s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=367.42s)]
*  President Zelensky's tribute was especially poignant. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=369.66s)]
*  He said that Biden, quote, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=372.42s)]
*  supported our country during the most dramatic moment [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=373.68s)]
*  in history. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  The subtext obviously of all these messages [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=377.7s)]
*  is deep anxiety that Donald Trump might win in November. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=379.94s)]
*  The Russians were a little more subdued [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=384.58s)]
*  than Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said, quote, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=386.22s)]
*  "'We need to be patient and see what happens next.'" [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=390.14s)]
*  I have to say, I kind of feel for the Russians here [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=393.62s)]
*  because it must suck to have to rewrite [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=395.66s)]
*  all of your election interference plans. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=397.74s)]
*  Well, I mean, the same problem that Trump campaign had, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=399.96000000000004s)]
*  right, when they had to like repaint the wall [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=402.86s)]
*  that had like Joe Biden week on it or something. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=405.42s)]
*  I mean, all of this troll farm energy [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=407.34000000000003s)]
*  that has been ginned up, you know, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=410.66s)]
*  now they got to repurpose it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=411.90000000000003s)]
*  I wonder how long it will take them [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=412.90000000000003s)]
*  to kind of fix all their copy and get back in the game. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=414.5s)]
*  Like, are they working slow? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=418.22s)]
*  Are they fast? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=419.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, they'll probably walk into the same trap. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=420.54s)]
*  They'll like send around, oh, here she is cackling. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=422.82s)]
*  Next thing they know, some Russian disinformation [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=425.34000000000003s)]
*  is actually like a viral TikTok video for Kamala. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=427.54s)]
*  Yeah, Godspeed. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=430.1s)]
*  But the other thing that's happening now, Ben, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=432.08000000000004s)]
*  is like, you know, all these same foreign leaders [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=433.34000000000003s)]
*  are trying to figure out where Kamala Harris [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=434.94s)]
*  differs on foreign policy from Joe Biden. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=436.82s)]
*  Politico did some great reporting on the contrast [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=440.26s)]
*  that we'll draw from a bunch in this segment. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=442.58s)]
*  But let's start with like non-Israel stuff [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=444.42s)]
*  because we're gonna go heavy on that later. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=446.54s)]
*  And these BBs come to DC. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=448.14s)]
*  But starting in her Senate days, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=450.26s)]
*  before becoming vice president, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=452.54s)]
*  Senator Harris didn't have a super long foreign policy record [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=454.9s)]
*  to draw from, but she was in the Senate for four years [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=457.76s)]
*  and served on the Intelligence Committee [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=459.98s)]
*  and the Homeland Security Committee. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=461.7s)]
*  So as far as committees you're gonna be on, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=463.18s)]
*  it wasn't ag, you know what I mean? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=465.3s)]
*  She was like- [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=466.7s)]
*  We got something against that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=467.54s)]
*  No, well, a little bit, a little boring. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=468.54s)]
*  But she was like doing, she was doing world stuff, right? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=470.5s)]
*  Like she was kind of in the intel world muck. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=473.14s)]
*  While in the Senate, Harris voted for General Mattis [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=476.54s)]
*  to be Trump's secretary of defense, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=479.98s)]
*  but against Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel to run the CIA. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=481.84000000000003s)]
*  Judgment to lead. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=485.58s)]
*  She voted against Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=486.54s)]
*  for secretary of state. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=489.22s)]
*  Love it. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=490.54s)]
*  And against Mark Esper to be secretary of defense. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=491.54s)]
*  So some solid no votes so far. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=493.78s)]
*  Yeah, pretty strong judgment there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=495.54s)]
*  Harris was supportive of the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=498.46s)]
*  Obviously the vote itself happened [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=501.98s)]
*  before her time in the Senate. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=503.94s)]
*  It was 2015, she got to the Senate in 2017. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=505.82s)]
*  But she also condemned Trump's strike [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=508.7s)]
*  against Qasem Soleimani, the top Iranian general. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=510.58s)]
*  She also wanted to restrict arms sales to Saudi Arabia [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=513.76s)]
*  because of the war in Yemen [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=516.64s)]
*  and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=517.78s)]
*  On China, she authored a bill with Marco Rubio [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=520.02s)]
*  that sanctioned officials in Hong Kong [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=522.78s)]
*  who undermined freedom and democracy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=524.8199999999999s)]
*  And she co-sponsored a bill that would allow [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=526.9399999999999s)]
*  the US government to sanction individuals [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=528.74s)]
*  responsible for human rights abuses in Xinjiang province. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=530.38s)]
*  So, generally speaking, I think she's seen [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=533.74s)]
*  as like less hawkish than Biden, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=536.26s)]
*  more skeptical of US troop presence overseas. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=538.12s)]
*  But anything from her time in the Senate [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=540.86s)]
*  that like jumped out at you [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=542.74s)]
*  or you think it's worth highlighting? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=543.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, first thing, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=545.74s)]
*  I'm just gonna like one pin in Biden decision. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=546.9s)]
*  You guys like rightly praised it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=550.62s)]
*  I think it's an incredibly, at the end of the day, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=552.62s)]
*  like we see him do the right thing, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=555.54s)]
*  which is a very Joe Biden thing, right? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=557.5s)]
*  It was a winding road, but he always gets there in the end [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=558.82s)]
*  to the right place on a lot of things. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=564.0600000000001s)]
*  But the one point I wanna make [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=565.82s)]
*  from a world of perspective is, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=566.9s)]
*  look, we were literally joking last week about Kagame, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=568.58s)]
*  but like in this era where nobody gives a power, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=571.78s)]
*  people like change the constitution to stay in power [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=576.34s)]
*  all around the world. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=578.82s)]
*  Like, I think it's an even more powerful example globally, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=579.6600000000001s)]
*  just as much as domestically. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=584.38s)]
*  So, all the more reason why he deserves a ton of credit. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=586.22s)]
*  I mean, Putin, Xi, Modi, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=590.0400000000001s)]
*  these guys have never even thought about giving a power. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=591.62s)]
*  They like retiring, nevermind giving a power. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=594.34s)]
*  I think, yeah, if you look at her, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=597.7800000000001s)]
*  first of all, like, and maybe not surprising [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=599.72s)]
*  for someone who clearly had national ambitions, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=602.12s)]
*  but she kind of sought out these portfolios, that's clear. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=604.84s)]
*  She also always kind of surrounded herself by, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=608.9200000000001s)]
*  good teams, good experts on these issues. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=613.76s)]
*  But yeah, I think your lay down kind of indicates [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=616.72s)]
*  that she shades progressive. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=620.6s)]
*  She's not like Bernie or something, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=623.5600000000001s)]
*  but she shades progressive in the ways [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=626.0s)]
*  in which she was willing to kind of get involved [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=628.6s)]
*  in terms of Saudi, Saudi Arabia, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=632.16s)]
*  or willing to kind of take a values-based position [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=635.8s)]
*  when it came to China and Hong Kong. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=639.68s)]
*  Someone who clearly wants to bring democracy [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=642.76s)]
*  and issues of equity and justice [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=645.0s)]
*  into her portfolio as a Senator on these issues. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=647.78s)]
*  And what I like about it is, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=651.88s)]
*  I always like it when politicians take [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=654.64s)]
*  like their identity domestically [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=656.36s)]
*  and they like stretch it internationally. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=659.4s)]
*  So somebody who comes out of, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=661.56s)]
*  not just criminal justice, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=664.28s)]
*  but kind of justice politics generally, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  that's the prism through which she was dealing [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=668.8s)]
*  with international issues. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=670.5799999999999s)]
*  And again, willing to kind of take on [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=672.8s)]
*  some difficult political questions as well. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=674.8s)]
*  So I think we didn't get to see her for a long time [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=678.3s)]
*  in the Senate before she was Vice President, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=681.6999999999999s)]
*  but she was kind of beginning to carve out [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=684.0799999999999s)]
*  like a place that feels more in the kind of, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=686.2399999999999s)]
*  for nerdy people follow the hill, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=690.6999999999999s)]
*  like that kind of Chris Murphy, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=692.18s)]
*  you're not left or center, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=693.86s)]
*  you're kind of, you're tilting towards [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=695.38s)]
*  the progressive side of foreign policy issues. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=698.18s)]
*  Yeah, another interesting kind of footnote [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=700.62s)]
*  to this election is, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=702.3s)]
*  given who's on Kamala Harris's shortlist, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=703.66s)]
*  this will probably be the first year [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=707.38s)]
*  since the Iraq War began [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=709.74s)]
*  with no major party candidate who voted for it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=711.54s)]
*  God, I mean, like this fits into the whole, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=715.3399999999999s)]
*  one of the whole arguments for a candidacy, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=718.1999999999999s)]
*  not by no means the only one, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=721.0799999999999s)]
*  but this sense of like we've been carrying around [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=723.52s)]
*  all of this baggage from all these debates [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=726.24s)]
*  for the last 20 years, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=728.9599999999999s)]
*  whether it's Iraq or whether it's how you felt [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=731.04s)]
*  about the Clintons or whether it's, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=733.0s)]
*  now it's obviously been this Trump shadow. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=735.24s)]
*  And this whole ticket is clearly going to be, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=737.92s)]
*  unless she's in a very strange direction, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=743.16s)]
*  this whole ticket is gonna be like a new generation, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=746.04s)]
*  a new brand of democratic party politics, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=749.9599999999999s)]
*  the good of Joe Biden in terms of some things he did [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=753.92s)]
*  around industrial policy and kind of, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=756.64s)]
*  the future oriented investments and climate and things, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=759.92s)]
*  but this capacity to just kind of move into a new era [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  and on foreign policy in particular, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=766.64s)]
*  like we desperately need that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=769.48s)]
*  Everybody's kind of so anchored in kind of, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=771.68s)]
*  I'm glad frankly that she doesn't have a huge paper trail [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=773.94s)]
*  in the debates around the war on terror, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=777.4200000000001s)]
*  the surge in Afghanistan or, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=779.62s)]
*  because we're unburdened by that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=781.7s)]
*  It'd be a mess to be unburdened by that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=784.6600000000001s)]
*  We are unburdened by that. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=785.86s)]
*  So let's talk about her tenure as vice president. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=787.22s)]
*  So look, she's spent four years [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=789.86s)]
*  at the highest possible level [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=792.94s)]
*  of foreign policy decision-making. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=794.5s)]
*  She was in the PDB every day. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=795.86s)]
*  She's in every major national security council meeting. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=798.1s)]
*  She has attended major international summits [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=800.82s)]
*  on Biden's behalf, including ASEAN, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=804.06s)]
*  the Munich security summit, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=806.74s)]
*  like all the kind of wonky gatherings. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=808.22s)]
*  She has met with countless foreign leaders at this point. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=810.9s)]
*  So there's just like no question [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=813.94s)]
*  that she is eminently qualified for the job [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=815.1s)]
*  when it comes to foreign policy. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=816.98s)]
*  The question has been, what is her, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=818.96s)]
*  who works for her, like personnel? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=821.06s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reported today on Tuesday [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=823.7s)]
*  that it's likely that top national security aides [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=826.7s)]
*  for Joe Biden, people like Jake Sullivan, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=831.38s)]
*  the national security advisor, Tony Blinken, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=832.9399999999999s)]
*  Secretary of State, and Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=834.86s)]
*  are not likely to continue in their jobs. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=837.9s)]
*  That isn't a huge surprise [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=840.5799999999999s)]
*  because all of those guys have those jobs [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=842.02s)]
*  because their relationship with Biden, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=843.4599999999999s)]
*  and I bet they want to break, but it's notable. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=845.1s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say like a couple things about that. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=847.5799999999999s)]
*  First of all, sometimes you can kind of look at that, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=850.9399999999999s)]
*  oh, she just went to some meetings, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=853.18s)]
*  what does that really matter? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=854.9s)]
*  It does, for this reason. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=855.98s)]
*  Like there are two things that jump out to me. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=857.8199999999999s)]
*  One is she's been in some pretty like high stakes, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=861.06s)]
*  tight rope type scenarios. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=864.38s)]
*  Like she was at the Munich Security Conference, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=866.18s)]
*  which you can, and I have at times to roll my eyes about, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=869.8599999999999s)]
*  but she was at the one like days before Russia invaded [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=873.1199999999999s)]
*  when it was like super tense. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=875.9s)]
*  And in these discussions, including with Zelensky, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=877.92s)]
*  including with Europeans, teeing up sanctions, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=879.9799999999999s)]
*  sharing intelligence, look, that's a high stakes moment [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=882.9399999999999s)]
*  that you can't be in if you're a senator, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=887.18s)]
*  you can't be in if you're a governor. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=889.18s)]
*  She's been in really tense rooms with high stakes, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=891.42s)]
*  and I think that does prepare someone. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=895.3000000000001s)]
*  She's also, like you mentioned ASEAN, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=897.6s)]
*  look, as someone who had to go, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=900.04s)]
*  you went to ASEAN summits, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=902.62s)]
*  when you have to go glee to US delegation at a summit [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=904.26s)]
*  with like 10 Southeast Asian countries like that, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=907.1800000000001s)]
*  and she went to Vietnam, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=910.26s)]
*  you have to kind of get your mind around a whole issue set [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=911.64s)]
*  that is, again, foreign to even most senators, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=914.74s)]
*  most governors. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=917.84s)]
*  So this is real experience. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=918.82s)]
*  It's not just like she showed up and like went to a dinner, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  like she's been in tough places, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=924.26s)]
*  tough rooms and tough conversations, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=925.9s)]
*  and she's been interacting with issues that you can't [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=928.3s)]
*  unless you're kind of in the executive branch [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=932.4599999999999s)]
*  of this government. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=933.9s)]
*  On the personnel, she should have her own team. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=934.74s)]
*  I mean, first of all, you're right. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=938.26s)]
*  Like we know those guys. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=940.1s)]
*  I think Jake, Tony, like this guy's need a break anyway. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=942.06s)]
*  And they're also Biden's people. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=945.86s)]
*  And like Tony Blinken has been with Joe Biden for decades. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=947.38s)]
*  And I think it's important for her to figure out, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=950.26s)]
*  okay, who are my people? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=952.66s)]
*  And maybe some of them will be people who worked for Biden [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=953.5s)]
*  too, I'm sure some of them will, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=956.26s)]
*  but it's very important to give her the space to build this. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=958.5s)]
*  So one thing I'll say is like her national security advisor [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=961.22s)]
*  is a guy named Phil Gordon. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=964.8199999999999s)]
*  Guest on the show. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=967.26s)]
*  Great guy. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=968.1s)]
*  I mean, like I love Phil Gordon. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=968.9399999999999s)]
*  He was in the Obama years, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=970.9s)]
*  he was Assistant Secretary of State for Europe [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=973.54s)]
*  in the first term, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=975.02s)]
*  and then he was the kind of Middle East czar [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=975.86s)]
*  in the second term. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=977.7s)]
*  You know, there through the, you know, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=979.94s)]
*  in the run up to the Iran deal, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=982.5400000000001s)]
*  really thoughtful guy, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=985.62s)]
*  wrote a book basically about the history [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=986.5400000000001s)]
*  of the failure of regime change in the Middle East. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=988.4200000000001s)]
*  Which is, you know, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=991.6600000000001s)]
*  a guy that has been willing to learn the lessons [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=992.5s)]
*  of what's gone wrong with US foreign policy, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  deeply connected, you know, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=997.9000000000001s)]
*  like Phil's the kind of guy that, you know, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=999.4200000000001s)]
*  knows people all over the world. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1000.94s)]
*  And if you follow Kamala's arc, you know, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1003.5s)]
*  like she's really hit a stride in foreign policy, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1008.0600000000001s)]
*  like with Phil, you know, the last couple of years. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1011.1s)]
*  So I think she's got a good core team there [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1014.14s)]
*  around her in the vice president's office. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1016.9s)]
*  And then the question that'll be really interesting [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1019.1800000000001s)]
*  in the vice presidency will be the first, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1020.94s)]
*  just like JD Vance who are saying is a tell [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1022.78s)]
*  about what kind of foreign policy Trump might have. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1024.58s)]
*  You know, it does send a message about like who she picks, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1026.9s)]
*  what kind of experience she looks for in a vice president. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1029.38s)]
*  And then, yeah, I think she should, you know, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1032.94s)]
*  she shouldn't name like a future cabinet, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1035.5s)]
*  but you know, you can kind of get a sense [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1038.26s)]
*  of who she calling for advice. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1039.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you have like those little, you know, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1041.38s)]
*  policy coordination groups and things. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1042.58s)]
*  People can tell. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1044.98s)]
*  And just kind of who she's like, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1045.82s)]
*  who's the sounding board for her. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1046.82s)]
*  Like, and I think that all will emerge, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1048.06s)]
*  but the, you know, this opportunity to kind of build [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1051.06s)]
*  a post Obama, post Biden, you know, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1053.02s)]
*  post war on terror team, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1056.9s)]
*  it will be an interesting one with a lot of potential for, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1059.3s)]
*  you know, I'd like to see, frankly, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1062.18s)]
*  I have long thought there needs to be more diversity [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1063.86s)]
*  in foreign policy, diversity of, you know, ethnic gender, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1065.6599999999999s)]
*  but also, you know, ideological. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1069.34s)]
*  So she's got an opportunity to kind of take the slate, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1070.98s)]
*  take some of the best competencies [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1074.62s)]
*  of the Biden administration and then, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1076.3799999999999s)]
*  but take some new flavor that can be really, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1078.5s)]
*  you know, a shot in the arm. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1083.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and she was like the governor of Connecticut [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1084.7s)]
*  and she won and she was coming in cold. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1087.3799999999999s)]
*  Like she would probably look to the previous administration [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1089.9399999999998s)]
*  and hire a bunch of people kind of sight unseen [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1093.1399999999999s)]
*  or after a meeting or two. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1095.3799999999999s)]
*  Now she's worked with all these people for four years. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1096.3s)]
*  She knows who's good. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1098.1399999999999s)]
*  She knows who's not good. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1099.34s)]
*  Like she's like, our friends on the political side [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1100.6599999999999s)]
*  will make fun of us for talking about ASEAN so much, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1103.54s)]
*  but I totally agree with you. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1106.4599999999998s)]
*  Like you can sit in your office and read briefing papers [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1108.02s)]
*  about the Philippines and Cambodia and Myanmar [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1111.5s)]
*  for, you know, your whole life. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1115.6999999999998s)]
*  But when you actually go to a summit [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1117.54s)]
*  and you're gonna have to be prepped to be in the meeting [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1119.1799999999998s)]
*  with those leaders and like really get your arms [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1121.46s)]
*  around those issues. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1124.02s)]
*  It's just a different kind of experience. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1124.8600000000001s)]
*  You really do, you have to sit there and have like a debate [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1125.7s)]
*  about the South China Sea. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1127.5s)]
*  You know, you're talking about climate change [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1129.3400000000001s)]
*  in a different part of the world. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1131.7s)]
*  You're obviously talking a lot about China [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1133.14s)]
*  and how it interacts with that region. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1135.3400000000001s)]
*  So you're right, she's got this, you know, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1137.7s)]
*  Obama when he came in, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1139.26s)]
*  he didn't obviously have that experience. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1140.38s)]
*  And so that informed in part his decision [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1141.8600000000001s)]
*  to have like Bob Gates hang on at Secretary of State, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1144.5s)]
*  Secretary of Defense and Hillary at State. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1147.0600000000002s)]
*  Kamala has more experience than that. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1149.34s)]
*  You know, but she'll still wanna, I mean, you know, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1151.62s)]
*  the question is what does she wanna supplement? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1153.4599999999998s)]
*  And she can draw from not just kind of military people [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1155.4199999999998s)]
*  and national security people, people in Congress. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1158.4199999999998s)]
*  Like there's a lot of smart people in Congress. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1160.8999999999999s)]
*  We have some Democrats in national security roles. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1162.22s)]
*  We get some really good national security people [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1164.06s)]
*  in Congress that could come into the cabinet. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1165.86s)]
*  So she's got a lot to work with. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1167.6999999999998s)]
*  So I heard you actually say something really interesting. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1169.6999999999998s)]
*  You may have meant it as a throwaway on PSA, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1172.1s)]
*  but like a Pete Buttigieg could be a secretary of defense, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1174.3s)]
*  you know. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1177.54s)]
*  Well, I just love to see him like not encumbered [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1178.42s)]
*  with the job of Department of Transportation [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1180.94s)]
*  and just out on the campaign trail. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1182.7800000000002s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1184.5400000000002s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1185.38s)]
*  So you said it that way, you're like, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1186.22s)]
*  go do the campaign drill and then come back. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1187.0600000000002s)]
*  But then I was like, well, Pete would actually make [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1189.1000000000001s)]
*  a pretty interesting secretary of defense, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1190.6200000000001s)]
*  like running a big organization. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1191.7s)]
*  But anyway, that's- [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1193.74s)]
*  No, and like he has military service. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1194.5800000000002s)]
*  He'd walk out on it. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1195.9s)]
*  Like no one studies harder than that guy. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1196.74s)]
*  Like he'd be a good communicator. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1198.46s)]
*  Our buddy Dennis Moduna who's running VA really well, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1199.3000000000002s)]
*  he could be a good secretary of defense. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1201.66s)]
*  Hell yeah, get them all out there. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1202.74s)]
*  So Ben, like we, it's, you know, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1204.98s)]
*  some of the Republicans that the hacks have already started, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1207.02s)]
*  they're gonna spend a lot of time trying to tie [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1209.7s)]
*  Kamala Harris to challenges with immigration and the border. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1211.94s)]
*  They call her Biden's border czar. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1214.82s)]
*  She was not, she was tasked with trying to address [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1217.06s)]
*  the root causes of migration in Central American countries. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1220.54s)]
*  But that will be a thing you hear. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1224.46s)]
*  Can I say one thing about that real quick? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1226.86s)]
*  Which is that she had the exact same portfolio [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1228.42s)]
*  that Joe Biden had. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1232.34s)]
*  And nobody called Joe Biden Obama's border czar. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1233.82s)]
*  Yeah, I just think it wasn't as salient then, right? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1237.66s)]
*  It wasn't as salient. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1239.18s)]
*  It just points to how disingenuous it is. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1240.02s)]
*  Because she had nothing to do with most of the policies, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1242.58s)]
*  almost all the policies related to the border. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1245.82s)]
*  She was there to kind of stop push factor, not stop, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1247.58s)]
*  but begin to address push factors like governance [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1250.74s)]
*  and corruption in Central America. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1253.7s)]
*  That has nothing to do with border security. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1254.94s)]
*  In fact, they famously got very mad at her, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1256.8999999999999s)]
*  Republicans did, for not going to the border. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1258.94s)]
*  So give me a break. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1260.8999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, give me a break. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1261.82s)]
*  She's also seen as more progressive than Biden [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1262.74s)]
*  when it comes to Gaza. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1265.22s)]
*  And we've discussed on this show that she is just better, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1266.7s)]
*  like full stop at sounding empathetic [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1270.38s)]
*  about the suffering of the Palestinian people. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1274.26s)]
*  According to that same Wall Street Journal's piece [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1277.14s)]
*  that talked about the personnel, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1279.78s)]
*  Harris is expected to skip Netanyahu's speech, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1281.22s)]
*  but meet with him bilaterally. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1283.86s)]
*  And in that same story, an advisor offered this quote, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1285.18s)]
*  that's characterizing what she's gonna say to Netanyahu, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1289.42s)]
*  it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1293.26s)]
*  All hostages are released. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1296.34s)]
*  The suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1297.98s)]
*  and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1300.86s)]
*  to dignity, freedom and self-determination. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1302.94s)]
*  Love the first aid words of that. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1306.3s)]
*  I worry that there's a lot of wiggle room in there for Bibi, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1308.8999999999999s)]
*  but certainly better than the current status quo. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1314.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, there's the politics, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1317.86s)]
*  then there's the policy of this. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1322.86s)]
*  On the politics, I think Biden had a real problem, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1324.46s)]
*  like in places like Michigan on this. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1329.98s)]
*  And I think even though she's obviously been a part [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1331.86s)]
*  of the policy as vice president, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1334.58s)]
*  there is an opportunity here, I think, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1337.74s)]
*  to kind of win back some of those voters [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1339.7s)]
*  that were disenchanted. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1343.06s)]
*  The uncommitted voters. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1344.54s)]
*  Because they don't see her as like designing the policy [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1345.38s)]
*  and she's not been designing the policy. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1348.8200000000002s)]
*  And to your point, she speaks more forcefully [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1350.8600000000001s)]
*  about the Palestinian perspective [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1353.5800000000002s)]
*  and actually was so forceful in calling for a ceasefire [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1357.98s)]
*  that the administration had to clarify [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1361.98s)]
*  that they weren't doing that. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1363.42s)]
*  So the politics shift on this. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1365.8600000000001s)]
*  One last thank you to Joe Biden for his decision [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1367.9s)]
*  to address the nation. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1375.42s)]
*  Obviously the most important thing [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1376.22s)]
*  is putting his country first. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1377.0600000000002s)]
*  But stepping on Bibi Netanyahu's speech. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1378.7800000000002s)]
*  I love it. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1380.9s)]
*  I love it, I love it. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1381.74s)]
*  I hope, I mean, I'm sure that it had to do [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1382.5800000000002s)]
*  with when he was better from COVID [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1385.8600000000001s)]
*  and wanting to address the nation the first time. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1387.3000000000002s)]
*  But even if there was a tiny part of him [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1389.0200000000002s)]
*  that was like, be nice to just kind of make Bibi's speech [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1391.14s)]
*  even more of a non-event, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1394.5400000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden addressing the nation [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1395.8600000000001s)]
*  right after Bibi does his Congress speech [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1397.66s)]
*  is kind of wonderful in that manner. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1399.7800000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah, I hadn't thought about that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1402.5800000000002s)]
*  Just sort of stepping on the news cycle generally, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1404.5s)]
*  but you're right. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1406.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1406.9399999999998s)]
*  who's gonna pay any attention to the speech? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1407.76s)]
*  Anyway, to the policy, yeah, like that's, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1409.3s)]
*  look, that comment kind of says everything, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1412.78s)]
*  but it leaves a lot to question, right? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1416.4199999999998s)]
*  Like, the question is, right, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1418.4199999999998s)]
*  returns all hostages, does that mean open-ended war [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1421.26s)]
*  if there's a single hostage not left? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1425.06s)]
*  Or does that mean like, ceasefire now and negotiate? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1426.78s)]
*  So they have to fill in a lot of gaps. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1430.58s)]
*  And this will be tricky for them. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1433.42s)]
*  I mean, because they can't really fully deviate. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1434.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, she's still the vice president. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1438.94s)]
*  Joe Biden's still the president. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1439.78s)]
*  Joe Biden's still the president. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1440.6200000000001s)]
*  She's still the vice president. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1441.6200000000001s)]
*  So I'm kind of- [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1442.8600000000001s)]
*  She can't really threaten to cut off aid right now. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1445.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm kind of preemptively defending, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1447.74s)]
*  I just, I don't know what they'll say, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1451.14s)]
*  but like, she can't kind of break that much. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1452.76s)]
*  Therefore, in a world in which she can't break [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1457.18s)]
*  that much substantively from the position [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1460.78s)]
*  of the Biden administration, her tone does matter [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1463.22s)]
*  because that's where she can choose her own words. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1465.94s)]
*  She can choose the language she's to describe, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1468.42s)]
*  what's happening, she can choose what to emphasize. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1470.48s)]
*  And so I would hope that there's an opportunity for her [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1473.18s)]
*  to kind of emphasize the Palestinian suffering [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1476.94s)]
*  and things like the need to respect the dignity [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1482.7s)]
*  and equality of the Palestinian people [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1485.94s)]
*  in ways that signal something of a new tone. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1487.86s)]
*  And that alone, I think, sends a message. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1491.26s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1494.2199999999998s)]
*  So before we get to Bibi's visit, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1495.62s)]
*  I mean, anything else, big picture, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1497.3s)]
*  we kind of talked through this as we went, but- [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1498.86s)]
*  I think the one thing I'd say is that like Joe Biden, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1500.86s)]
*  what's interesting about Kamala and foreign policies, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1503.4599999999998s)]
*  it's not unlike domestic, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1505.74s)]
*  Joe Biden's enormous strength in foreign policy [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1508.1s)]
*  is the kind of traditional core alliances [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1512.76s)]
*  with the United States, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1516.4s)]
*  like what he's done to repair relations with Europe [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1517.72s)]
*  and Asian allies, what he's done to reinvigorate NATO. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1521.6000000000001s)]
*  The weaker spot, one of the weaker spots [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1525.88s)]
*  has been kind of an incapacity to really break through [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1529.24s)]
*  an outreach to the global South. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1533.0800000000002s)]
*  And Kamala had, I think, a quite successful trip to Africa. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1536.5600000000002s)]
*  We talked about it on the podcast at the time. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1540.44s)]
*  Obviously she has an Indian- [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1543.0s)]
*  Mom. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1545.94s)]
*  Heritage, an Indian mom. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1546.86s)]
*  I'm excited to think about her capacity [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1549.24s)]
*  to take a message of partnership and engagement [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1552.98s)]
*  to places like Africa, to places like South Asia, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1556.84s)]
*  to places like Southeast Asia with Tech Badassian. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1560.42s)]
*  To the Caribbean too, I mean, she's Jamaican. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1563.4s)]
*  Yeah, because of her identity [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1564.96s)]
*  and also just because of the issue set, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1567.52s)]
*  climate, technology, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1569.14s)]
*  these kind of more future-oriented issues. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1571.02s)]
*  So I think she can kind of open up the aperture a bit. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1574.22s)]
*  And we were there under Obama, that stuff matters. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1577.02s)]
*  Like the excitement and energy that people felt [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1580.7s)]
*  in those countries, in those regions, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1584.02s)]
*  made it easier to bring them on board on certain things. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1587.46s)]
*  And so I think what Kamala could really do [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1589.78s)]
*  is kind of expand the scope of countries [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1592.42s)]
*  that we are engaging with. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1595.92s)]
*  And on these issues like climate and AI [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1597.48s)]
*  and the future of technologies. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1600.18s)]
*  And I think she could bring a lot to the table there. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1602.3s)]
*  Yeah, and the message to the world [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1605.9s)]
*  of the United States of America [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1607.14s)]
*  electing a woman to be president of the United States [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1608.74s)]
*  would be enormous, especially, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1611.02s)]
*  I mean, it speaks to how crazy our politics must look [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1612.74s)]
*  to the rest of the world that the United States [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1617.1000000000001s)]
*  bans abortion and then potentially elects [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1619.8400000000001s)]
*  the first woman president. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1622.78s)]
*  We're going through some stuff here. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1624.3s)]
*  I think if she beats Trump, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1626.18s)]
*  it's even more powerful than if Biden had beaten Trump. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1627.98s)]
*  I agree. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1630.3s)]
*  Because it's like, first of all, we'll be done with Trump. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1631.14s)]
*  I just don't think this guy will be 83 next time around. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1633.46s)]
*  He's not looking great. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1636.94s)]
*  Yeah, like he's not looking great. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1637.78s)]
*  So like this fear that Biden, through no fault of his own, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1639.4s)]
*  had to deal with, which is that the whole Biden presidency [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1643.46s)]
*  it's been like, is Trump gonna come back? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1646.1000000000001s)]
*  Everywhere I travel, every time, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1647.38s)]
*  it's like, is Trump gonna come back? [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1649.46s)]
*  That question will be put to rest [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1651.02s)]
*  and will be put to rest by a black woman who is younger. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1652.5800000000002s)]
*  I actually think for the first time, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1657.1s)]
*  it won't end all these problems, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1660.4599999999998s)]
*  but there'll be a light, a distant light [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1662.1799999999998s)]
*  at the end of the tunnel when she's elected. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1665.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's so exciting to think about. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1667.1s)]
*  Nice little cleansing. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1668.72s)]
*  Okay, before we get to that moment of joy, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1670.4599999999998s)]
*  we have Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1673.1399999999999s)]
*  in Washington addressing a joint session of Congress. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1676.06s)]
*  It'll happen the day this pod comes out. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1679.1799999999998s)]
*  This will be Netanyahu's fourth address to Congress, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1681.22s)]
*  more than any other foreign leader, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1684.74s)]
*  including Winston Churchill. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1686.54s)]
*  They thought, this guy, he should talk to us more often [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1688.58s)]
*  than Winston Churchill did. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1691.98s)]
*  Good job, US Congress. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1693.82s)]
*  Great work. Give me a break. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1694.82s)]
*  So as we've mentioned, I mean, Netanyahu is there [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1695.64s)]
*  because all four congressional leaders invited him. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1698.06s)]
*  So this is a bipartisan bad decision, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1700.94s)]
*  as so many are foreign policy. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1703.46s)]
*  An Israeli official told Axios [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1706.1s)]
*  that the speech won't be quote, defiantly against Biden [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1707.94s)]
*  and will have quote, a bipartisan message [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1711.34s)]
*  on the need for the US to support Israel during the war. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1714.02s)]
*  I'm not sure how that message can be totally bipartisan [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1717.06s)]
*  given that many Democrats want to cut off support [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1720.26s)]
*  for the war, but fine. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1722.84s)]
*  Axios also reported that Netanyahu aides [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1724.58s)]
*  have previewed the speech with the White House, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1726.82s)]
*  so it won't be a total surprise. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1729.02s)]
*  Now, regardless, as many as 100 House and Senate Democrats [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1730.62s)]
*  might skip the speech in protest. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1734.6399999999999s)]
*  Here's a clip from Senator Bernie Sanders explaining why. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1737.1399999999999s)]
*  I will not be going to listen to Mr. Netanyahu. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1740.3799999999999s)]
*  I think he's a war criminal. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1743.1s)]
*  I think he never should have been invited. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1744.3s)]
*  And I think it's a real problem for the Biden administration, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1745.9399999999998s)]
*  but above and beyond that, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1748.3799999999999s)]
*  Trump will be worse even on that issue. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1749.74s)]
*  Ben, where do you land before we get to the substance [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1752.26s)]
*  on this question of whether to boycott or not? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1754.78s)]
*  Boycott? I mean, why on earth would he, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1756.86s)]
*  what is there to see? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1758.86s)]
*  Yeah, boycott and the shit out of this thing. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1759.6999999999998s)]
*  There's some trolls showing up to like, you know, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1760.54s)]
*  basically divide Democrats, like interfere in our politics, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1763.86s)]
*  try to buttress his own numbers back home. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1768.74s)]
*  That's the only thing he's doing, you know? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1770.5s)]
*  A couple of things I want to point out, Tommy, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1772.5s)]
*  I'm going to be petty before I get substantive. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1774.5s)]
*  The Post has a great article today. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1776.8999999999999s)]
*  The headline is Israel's Netanyahu [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1778.62s)]
*  brings his dirty laundry to Washington. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1779.9399999999998s)]
*  Literally. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1782.26s)]
*  Now, what this is about is apparently, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1783.1s)]
*  when you are staying here in the guest house for visitors, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1787.1s)]
*  your laundry's done. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1791.9399999999998s)]
*  And here's a quote from the story. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1792.78s)]
*  Quote, the Netanyahu's are the only ones [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1794.4599999999998s)]
*  who bring actual suitcases of dirty laundry [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1796.54s)]
*  for us to clean, said one US official. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1799.54s)]
*  After multiple trips, it became clear this was intentional. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1802.78s)]
*  This is, these people are so fucking petty that like, okay, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1805.5s)]
*  it's one thing if you're, it's like you're at a hotel. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1810.1s)]
*  And well, actually the hotels I stayed at don't do your laundry. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1812.14s)]
*  It's like your kids come home from college. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1813.98s)]
*  Yeah, but exactly. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1815.22s)]
*  Like these guys are packing up dirty laundry. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1816.18s)]
*  Trash bags. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1818.02s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1818.86s)]
*  So this is who we're talking about [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1819.68s)]
*  with Benjamin and Sarah Netanyahu. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1820.78s)]
*  The other quote I wanted to read from Jerry Nadler, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1823.78s)]
*  cause I read it on the way in here. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1825.74s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is the worst leader in Jewish history [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1828.3s)]
*  since the Maccabean King who invited the Romans [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1831.06s)]
*  into Jerusalem over 2,100 years ago. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1833.74s)]
*  I'm just gonna stop it there. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1836.58s)]
*  It's a longer tweet. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1837.54s)]
*  That was a good quote. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1838.3799999999999s)]
*  I just thought that was like a massive swing [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1839.2s)]
*  by Jerry Nadler, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1840.78s)]
*  represents my Upper West Side district of my heart. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1842.06s)]
*  Chained adds with historic deep cut. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1845.46s)]
*  But yeah, like, look, I actually think [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1846.94s)]
*  one of the interesting things here is, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1848.94s)]
*  when Netanyahu came in 2015, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1851.46s)]
*  you know, it was the biggest story in American politics [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1854.58s)]
*  for weeks that he did this. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1857.4199999999998s)]
*  Weeding up to it and after. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1859.58s)]
*  It was this kind of huge thing. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1860.4199999999998s)]
*  Was in the middle of the JCPOA process too. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1862.54s)]
*  He's not having that impact this time. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1865.02s)]
*  People, there's a kind of exhaustion with him [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1868.4599999999998s)]
*  as a personality. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1870.6999999999998s)]
*  Obviously we have massive political drama [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1872.4199999999998s)]
*  happening in this country. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1874.26s)]
*  It is kind of like, what is he doing here? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1875.9599999999998s)]
*  Like there's kind of a feeling of like, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1877.82s)]
*  this again, this guy again, you know? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1880.84s)]
*  And so the Republicans think it's like some massive, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1882.98s)]
*  and actually think they're wrong on the politics. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1885.34s)]
*  Like if they think that, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1886.9399999999998s)]
*  oh, they're gonna win over Jewish voters. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1888.0s)]
*  Like, I don't think so. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1889.9399999999998s)]
*  I think Jewish voters in this country [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1891.1s)]
*  have made up their minds about Netanyahu [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1892.58s)]
*  and most of them fucking hate the guy. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1893.86s)]
*  Just like in Israel, by the way, right? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1895.62s)]
*  And so I don't think it's like some big coup for them, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1897.6599999999999s)]
*  frankly. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1900.32s)]
*  So for all the more reason to just boycott it, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1902.62s)]
*  I don't think you're gonna pay some big price with voters. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1904.9399999999998s)]
*  Like there's no reason to listen to what this guy has to say [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1908.4199999999998s)]
*  because he's gaslighting, you know? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1911.08s)]
*  He's just hanging on to power the same way [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1913.4599999999998s)]
*  like Trump is trying to cling back to power. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1915.54s)]
*  And I just don't think there's any reason [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1917.6999999999998s)]
*  to pay much attention to it. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1919.54s)]
*  Yeah, and that's not his only event while he's here. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1920.4399999999998s)]
*  So he's gonna meet with Biden and Harris bilaterally. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1923.3799999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu is also expected to meet with Trump [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1928.6599999999999s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago, I think on Friday. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1931.6599999999999s)]
*  This obviously comes at a challenging political time [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1934.6999999999998s)]
*  for Joe Biden, when considering he just stepped back [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1937.3799999999999s)]
*  and isn't gonna run again. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1939.7399999999998s)]
*  But things aren't exactly going well for Bibi, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1940.58s)]
*  as you mentioned. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1943.22s)]
*  I mean, a recent poll found that 72% of Israelis [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1944.0600000000002s)]
*  want him to resign. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1946.9s)]
*  Maybe Biden can give him some advice. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1947.78s)]
*  He's not exactly coming here with strong political capital. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1949.6200000000001s)]
*  About that. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1951.22s)]
*  We reached out to our friend. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1952.18s)]
*  Biden can teach him how to say goodbye [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1954.02s)]
*  to a quote of Hamilton there. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1955.54s)]
*  Israelis would love that. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1957.22s)]
*  A little lib fantasy. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1958.0600000000002s)]
*  We reached out to our friend, Amir T. Bone, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1958.98s)]
*  who's an excellent journalist at Haaretz [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1961.46s)]
*  to get his take on Netanyahu's speech. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1964.0600000000002s)]
*  Let's listen, because we wanted an Israeli perspective [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1967.3000000000002s)]
*  on this. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1969.46s)]
*  For the Republican speaker of the house [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1970.3000000000002s)]
*  to give Netanyahu this invitation [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1972.3s)]
*  to come to Congress in the first place, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1974.2199999999998s)]
*  with a blatant intervention in our internal affairs. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1976.1399999999999s)]
*  This is all about Netanyahu's own political survival. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1980.3s)]
*  It's about him trying to recover the political ground [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1983.34s)]
*  that he has lost since the epic failure [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1987.02s)]
*  happened under his watch on October 7. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1990.02s)]
*  All the Democratic lawmakers who are planning [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1992.4599999999998s)]
*  to go to this theatrical political speech on Wednesday, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1994.74s)]
*  they are basically going to turn themselves [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=1999.98s)]
*  into the stage crew of a partisan event [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2003.02s)]
*  meant to help one politician internally in Israel [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2009.14s)]
*  at a time of great division in this country. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2012.94s)]
*  And again, at the end of the day, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2016.46s)]
*  it's either you stand with the families of the hostages [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2017.94s)]
*  or protesting out on the streets every day almost [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2020.78s)]
*  here in Israel for a beat [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2024.38s)]
*  against this far right Netanyahu government, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2026.34s)]
*  or you choose to stand with Netanyahu. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2028.7s)]
*  And I think it's clear where these lawmakers decided [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2031.18s)]
*  to place themselves. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2034.46s)]
*  Any Democratic politician who would bother [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2036.18s)]
*  to devote five minutes to this issue [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2038.7s)]
*  and read some polling from Israel [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2040.9s)]
*  and talk to families of hostages [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2042.8600000000001s)]
*  and talk to people like myself [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2044.8200000000002s)]
*  who are survivors of the October 7 attack. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2046.5s)]
*  And I lost 15 friends and neighbors on that day. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2049.54s)]
*  My family was almost murdered. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2052.26s)]
*  If you just take five minutes to understand [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2054.5s)]
*  and to listen to these voices from Israel, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2056.9s)]
*  you will understand why supporting Israel at this moment [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2059.6600000000003s)]
*  is crucial and important, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2063.2200000000003s)]
*  but supporting Netanyahu is the opposite. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2065.1000000000004s)]
*  And sadly, I think a lot of lawmakers [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2067.82s)]
*  are not going to do that homework. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2071.1400000000003s)]
*  That is so powerful. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2072.5800000000004s)]
*  Good advice. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2073.42s)]
*  Yeah, like he said, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2074.26s)]
*  and we revisited his story after October 7th, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2076.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, this is someone who believes deeply [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2079.98s)]
*  in the profound trauma and existential sense of insecurity [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2085.22s)]
*  that Israelis felt after October 7th. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2091.1s)]
*  Just to be good, Amir was trapped in a safe room [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2092.66s)]
*  with his wife and their three-year-old daughter [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2095.3s)]
*  for eight hours. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2097.7s)]
*  So this isn't some guy who doesn't get it. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2098.66s)]
*  Well, Hamas, his own father had to drive down from Tel Aviv [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2100.18s)]
*  to save his life, to fight his way into a war zone [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2104.02s)]
*  and save his life. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2107.3s)]
*  It's the most incredible story I've ever heard. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2108.14s)]
*  Yeah, and what he said, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2109.38s)]
*  if you think you're supporting Israel, you're not. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2111.82s)]
*  You're just supporting this guy. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2113.46s)]
*  Listen to that message, Democrats. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2115.46s)]
*  Like, why be like a, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2117.26s)]
*  he wants to put this veneer, this sheen of bipartisanship [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2119.62s)]
*  over his extreme far-right politics [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2122.98s)]
*  and his clear preference for Donald Trump [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2127.26s)]
*  in this election in a few months. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2129.98s)]
*  No reason to legitimize this guy. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2132.14s)]
*  No, and the reality is he has done more to damage [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2133.86s)]
*  the bipartisan nature of the US-Israel relationship [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2136.98s)]
*  than any other leader in history. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2140.06s)]
*  By far. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2141.46s)]
*  And Israel will be much better off, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2143.26s)]
*  America will be better off, the world will be better off [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2145.02s)]
*  when Israel can turn the page on this guy, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2147.26s)]
*  just like we're trying to turn the page on Trump here. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2149.34s)]
*  And look, we should just say, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2151.38s)]
*  like Bernie mentioned in his comment, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2152.9s)]
*  the man is like being charged as a war criminal [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2154.7400000000002s)]
*  by the International Criminal Court. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2158.6600000000003s)]
*  It is not the best look for the US Congress [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2160.0600000000004s)]
*  to be whatever you think about the ICC. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2163.1000000000004s)]
*  That is the reality. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2165.34s)]
*  And the ICJ, by the way, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2166.1800000000003s)]
*  just made another ruling about apartheid. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2167.3s)]
*  West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2170.7s)]
*  were deemed illegal, the occupation was deemed illegal. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2172.66s)]
*  And so the message it sends to the world [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2175.06s)]
*  is that we don't care about any of this, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2178.1s)]
*  that we're okay with that kind of hypocrisy. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2181.5s)]
*  So better to just have this be as low-profile as possible, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2183.74s)]
*  as few Democrats as possible. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2187.66s)]
*  And I guarantee you, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2188.98s)]
*  it is not the political winner the Republicans think it is [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2190.3399999999997s)]
*  because this man is not wildly popular [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2192.66s)]
*  in the American Jewish community. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2195.3399999999997s)]
*  So it's just not worth it. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2196.5s)]
*  Yeah, and it's also, I think it's worth pointing out [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2198.06s)]
*  that basically everybody in Israel now sees Netanyahu [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2199.7s)]
*  as the main impediment to a ceasefire deal. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2203.2599999999998s)]
*  And that from both sides, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2205.3799999999997s)]
*  the families of the hostages, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2206.9399999999996s)]
*  but also right-wingers who don't want a deal [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2208.1s)]
*  and want to occupy Gaza permanently. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2210.22s)]
*  Like it's clear that Netanyahu is rejecting concessions [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2212.06s)]
*  that his own team negotiated. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2215.46s)]
*  And it's also clear to me that he made a choice [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2217.3799999999997s)]
*  not to come and deliver a ceasefire deal in this speech. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2221.7s)]
*  He could have, but he didn't want to for whatever reason. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2225.14s)]
*  So, I mean, I think Ben, the thing you keep hearing, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2227.7s)]
*  the kind of background briefing line from Ron Dermer [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2229.8999999999996s)]
*  and all these people around Netanyahu to the press is, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2232.98s)]
*  this isn't 2015. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2235.74s)]
*  This is not him conspiring with Republicans [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2237.74s)]
*  to take a huge shot at Biden [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2240.58s)]
*  like he did with Obama back then. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2242.66s)]
*  Like, do you believe him? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2244.06s)]
*  No, I don't believe him. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2249.62s)]
*  I mean, nothing's different about Netanyahu. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2251.2999999999997s)]
*  What's different is like the context is a little different. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2253.8199999999997s)]
*  Right? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2255.8999999999996s)]
*  It was like Obama had a clear initiative, the JCPOA, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2256.9799999999996s)]
*  that Netanyahu already publicly opposed. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2259.7799999999997s)]
*  And he was kind of coming as a lobbyist against that deal. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2262.02s)]
*  And so that was the context. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2265.2599999999998s)]
*  This context is different. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2267.06s)]
*  He's got an American president, Joe Biden, who, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2268.18s)]
*  let's face it, has pretty much given him a blank check. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2270.9799999999996s)]
*  So there's no Biden policy for him to come lobby against. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2273.4199999999996s)]
*  He's just- [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2277.66s)]
*  Just being a dick. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2278.5s)]
*  He's coming to fortify himself at home this time. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2279.3399999999997s)]
*  And buck up with Trump too. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2282.9399999999996s)]
*  But he's coming here to basically show the Israeli public [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2284.78s)]
*  the last thing I can, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2288.1800000000003s)]
*  the last card he has to play [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2290.5s)]
*  beyond hanging onto the far right [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2292.2200000000003s)]
*  is playing the card of, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2294.5400000000004s)]
*  hey, look, I can still get bipartisan support in the US. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2296.7400000000002s)]
*  As much as you hate me, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2301.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm the guy who knows how to play the Americans. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2302.0600000000004s)]
*  Watch me play the Americans like a fiddle. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2303.98s)]
*  And so I think it's about his politics back home, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2306.94s)]
*  his politics with Trump and the Magna Caucus [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2309.5s)]
*  and in the US Congress. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2311.5800000000004s)]
*  Yes, it probably won't be as confrontational as 2015, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2314.6600000000003s)]
*  but that's because what's he going to confront? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2318.42s)]
*  Because Biden has been, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2320.82s)]
*  if Biden had stopped giving offensive military assistance, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2322.3s)]
*  it might be different. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2325.7400000000002s)]
*  Baby is trying to make up things that Biden give him. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2326.9s)]
*  Quick thing before we go. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2330.3s)]
*  So the quick thing before we move on from this, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2331.1000000000004s)]
*  the Houthi rebels were able to somehow hit Tel Aviv [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2334.1400000000003s)]
*  with a drone last week. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2337.46s)]
*  Almost hit our embassy. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2338.3s)]
*  Yeah, almost hit our embassy. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2339.38s)]
*  Well, it's like hundreds of feet from away. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2340.86s)]
*  Somehow they got through all these really defenses, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2343.1s)]
*  missile defense systems. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2345.46s)]
*  Then I saw a report in the Wall Street Journal [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2346.7s)]
*  about how Pentagon officials are demanding [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2348.66s)]
*  a stronger response to the Houthis. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2351.14s)]
*  But again, like nothing we've done today [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2353.18s)]
*  that has deterred them. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2355.2599999999998s)]
*  So I don't know, maybe we should try ending the war in Gaza. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2356.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2358.2999999999997s)]
*  But finally, Amir had one last message [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2359.14s)]
*  for President Biden specifically [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2361.94s)]
*  about how he could help Israel [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2363.74s)]
*  in his final days in office. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2365.46s)]
*  I understand that the president is not seeking reelection [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2366.86s)]
*  and I want to encourage him to do everything he can [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2371.0200000000004s)]
*  in the six months that he's got left in office [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2374.2200000000003s)]
*  to bring back the hostages. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2377.5400000000004s)]
*  This is the most important priority. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2378.98s)]
*  This should be really the one legacy he can leave behind [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2381.7000000000003s)]
*  that he did not leave office on January 20 [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2386.0600000000004s)]
*  when there were still innocent men and women [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2389.5s)]
*  in the hands of terrorists in the tunnels of Gaza. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2393.26s)]
*  And he had a huge impact on the first hostage release [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2396.5s)]
*  deal in November, which brought us back [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2401.22s)]
*  dozens of people alive, many women and children. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2402.3399999999997s)]
*  And he can still have an impact over here [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2405.5s)]
*  and the pressure needs to be across the court [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2407.5s)]
*  on Netanyahu, on Qatar, in Egypt of course, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2409.8599999999997s)]
*  on the Hamas leadership who are the most responsible [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2413.98s)]
*  for this atrocity. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2416.9399999999996s)]
*  But everybody needs to feel the heat [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2418.4599999999996s)]
*  and if one man can do it, it's Joe Biden. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2420.14s)]
*  Love that advice. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2422.74s)]
*  Especially with Americans being held. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2423.66s)]
*  And it's a great point too that like with Biden, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2426.02s)]
*  he'll still obviously do some campaigning [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2429.1s)]
*  when I'm out there. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2432.22s)]
*  But like part of what he can do is try to close [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2433.74s)]
*  some accounts, right? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2437.46s)]
*  When your presidency is coming to an end. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2438.2999999999997s)]
*  And so getting to a ceasefire, getting the hostages [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2440.7s)]
*  returned, kind of getting Gaza in some kind of place [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2444.5s)]
*  where there's some rebuilding that's beginning, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2447.7s)]
*  that would be something that I think would be [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2451.5s)]
*  a natural area of focus for the next six months. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2454.34s)]
*  Probably getting some more aid to Ukraine. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2456.66s)]
*  These big things that they've been working on, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2458.3799999999997s)]
*  I think trying to kind of lead those [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2461.22s)]
*  in the best possible place, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2463.5s)]
*  I'm sure that will be a huge focus for them. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2464.98s)]
*  And Trump will absolutely say, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2467.3399999999997s)]
*  keep those hostages held in Gaza until I get to office [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2468.8999999999996s)]
*  and then I will release them [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2472.62s)]
*  because I'm the only man who can do so. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2473.9399999999996s)]
*  A couple other quick things, Ben. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2476.3799999999997s)]
*  Just a quick update on Bob Menendez, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2478.22s)]
*  Senator Bob Menendez who listeners know [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2479.54s)]
*  was recently convicted of taking bribes [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2481.1s)]
*  that included gold bars in exchange for official acts. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2483.14s)]
*  Menendez announced that he plans to resign [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2486.82s)]
*  from the US Senate effective August 20th. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2488.7000000000003s)]
*  So happy trails. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2491.1800000000003s)]
*  Good to see him leaving in total irrepute and disgrace, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2492.1000000000004s)]
*  befitting a career of it. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2495.7400000000002s)]
*  Relatedly, Kimberly Cheadle, the head of the Secret Service [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2497.46s)]
*  resigned on Tuesday. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2500.5400000000004s)]
*  She had somehow tried to cling to the job [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2502.1400000000003s)]
*  and argue that she was the best person to lead the agency. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2504.5400000000004s)]
*  But that argument was undercut [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2507.6600000000003s)]
*  by the fact that Trump got shot. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2509.46s)]
*  Yes, I mean, she probably could have saved a lot of time [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2512.1400000000003s)]
*  by just resigning earlier. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2515.66s)]
*  I think frankly, Biden could have just fired her earlier too. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2517.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2520.2999999999997s)]
*  Or it could have been a good leadership moment. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2521.14s)]
*  You need accountability. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2522.8199999999997s)]
*  And the accountability is not on the agents [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2523.98s)]
*  who jumped in front of Trump and did their job. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2526.54s)]
*  Or the local cops. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2528.46s)]
*  Looked willing to take a bullet. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2529.2999999999997s)]
*  You have institutions, there needs to be accountability. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2531.42s)]
*  That's what happened here. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2533.46s)]
*  And now I hope there's a process to just understand [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2534.7s)]
*  how can we better protect presidents [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2538.8599999999997s)]
*  or presidential candidates [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2542.18s)]
*  without not ever seeing them. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2544.06s)]
*  So I think reviewing protocols and digging in in a, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2547.86s)]
*  well, I'd like to think apolitical way, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2551.22s)]
*  but it probably won't be in Congress. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2553.22s)]
*  It would be worthwhile. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2555.46s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely think we should learn more, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2556.74s)]
*  but it's definitely, you had one job situation. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2558.18s)]
*  Well, and maybe don't allow a rooftop [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2560.9s)]
*  with a direct line of sight [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2564.98s)]
*  at a speaking presidential candidate to be uncovered. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2566.94s)]
*  That's a good note. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2572.54s)]
*  Security expert, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2573.54s)]
*  but I would assume that would be one place to start. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2575.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good start. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2576.98s)]
*  Let's turn to Bangladesh, Ben, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2578.34s)]
*  because there have been massive protests there [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2579.98s)]
*  that have left at least 174 people dead. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2581.82s)]
*  These demonstrations started over a quota system [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2584.7400000000002s)]
*  for government jobs that reserved 30% of positions [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2587.6600000000003s)]
*  for relatives of veterans who fought [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2590.7000000000003s)]
*  in Bangladesh's 1971 War of Independence from Pakistan. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2592.54s)]
*  Those slots combined with the government's other quotas [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2596.54s)]
*  meant that about 56% of government jobs [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2600.06s)]
*  were reserved for certain groups. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2603.98s)]
*  In response to the unrest in these protests, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2605.4199999999996s)]
*  the government led by Prime Minister Sheik Hasina [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2609.22s)]
*  imposed a curfew [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2612.22s)]
*  and a country-wide communications blackout, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2613.58s)]
*  cutting people off from the internet [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2615.7799999999997s)]
*  and in social media generally. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2617.06s)]
*  On Sunday, the Supreme Court ordered the quota [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2618.98s)]
*  for those connected to veterans be cut down to 5%. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2621.58s)]
*  Some students have vowed to continue these protests [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2625.1s)]
*  until the court order is fully honored. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2627.58s)]
*  Despite this, the communications blackout, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2630.18s)]
*  and then independent journalist named Redwan Ahmed [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2633.38s)]
*  was able to get us a voice note describing what was happening. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2635.26s)]
*  This is what he had to say. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2638.5800000000004s)]
*  In terms of the government response [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2639.6200000000003s)]
*  and their use of power to quell the protest was, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2642.3s)]
*  in my opinion, was very disproportionate. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2646.78s)]
*  The government used really brutal forces. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2649.5800000000004s)]
*  They used the police. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2652.7000000000003s)]
*  They used the pro-government activists, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2654.0600000000004s)]
*  the student wing of the Awami League and other wings. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2657.1400000000003s)]
*  They used the military. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2661.0600000000004s)]
*  They used the paramilitary troops. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2662.5400000000004s)]
*  So it's all against a group of university students, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2664.34s)]
*  a group of college students protesting for what they said [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2669.34s)]
*  were discriminatory in job sector, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2673.98s)]
*  in prior government job recruitment. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2677.1800000000003s)]
*  So we have seen, you know, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2680.1400000000003s)]
*  I was in the ground with my colleagues. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2682.1400000000003s)]
*  I have seen reporters getting killed in the protest. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2684.2200000000003s)]
*  There were onlookers. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2686.98s)]
*  There were bystanders who got hit by rubber bullets [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2688.86s)]
*  and the butt shots. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2692.8199999999997s)]
*  And there were numerous students. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2693.98s)]
*  The official death toll stands at, I think, 187 [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2696.7s)]
*  till this Tuesday evening. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2701.42s)]
*  And like for one is too many. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2704.9s)]
*  And you have to remember, like you were doing this [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2707.8599999999997s)]
*  against a group of college gurus, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2710.94s)]
*  a group of university students. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2713.3399999999997s)]
*  Some pretty horrifying images on Twitter right now [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2714.8599999999997s)]
*  of like protesters getting just shot [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2717.94s)]
*  at point blank range by the cops. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2720.18s)]
*  Then I was thinking, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2722.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if we've ever talked about Bangladesh [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2723.7799999999997s)]
*  on this show, but there's like 165 million people there. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2725.62s)]
*  It's like top 10 country by population. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2728.2999999999997s)]
*  I think it's one of the most densely populated countries [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2730.98s)]
*  in the world. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2733.02s)]
*  The economy is one of the fastest growing economies [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2733.8999999999996s)]
*  in the world in recent decades. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2736.7s)]
*  But clearly like the protests show [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2739.58s)]
*  that the growth wasn't felt equally. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2741.22s)]
*  The point I'm getting at is it's an important country, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2744.58s)]
*  an important relationship. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2746.66s)]
*  So the prime minister's critics have long accused her [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2747.9s)]
*  of using the government to turn the country [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2752.02s)]
*  into a one party state and crush their democracy. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2755.06s)]
*  It's like watching this, I mean, how worried are you [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2757.78s)]
*  about Bangladesh sliding into autocracy [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2760.6600000000003s)]
*  and how do you think it slots into this broader [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2763.78s)]
*  and anti-democratic trend we've seen? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2766.46s)]
*  I included them in that article I referenced [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2768.54s)]
*  that I wrote earlier. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2771.1s)]
*  They had a quote unquote election earlier this year. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2772.34s)]
*  Back in January. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2774.94s)]
*  In the run up to it, she detained like literally tens [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2775.94s)]
*  of thousands of people, including by the way, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2779.1800000000003s)]
*  people like, you know, Muhammad Yunus [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2781.7400000000002s)]
*  who the Nobel prize winning micro finance pioneer, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2783.7000000000003s)]
*  like a manifestly good man, you know, like, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2788.1800000000003s)]
*  and kind of crushing dissent. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2791.9s)]
*  And so she's, you know, had some autocratic tendencies, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2794.1400000000003s)]
*  but man, they're coming out in full force [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2796.82s)]
*  and basically turning this country [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2800.1400000000003s)]
*  into like a pretty harsh one party autocracy, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2802.34s)]
*  you know, live fire on protesters. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2807.5s)]
*  This quota system speaks to like a patronage economy [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2810.34s)]
*  where like, you know, only certain people aligned [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2814.1000000000004s)]
*  with the ruling party and their kind of origins [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2816.5s)]
*  and their interests and their cronies can benefit. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2819.1000000000004s)]
*  So to me, it's a signal, you know, we've talked about, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2822.86s)]
*  I mean, just globally, how this kind of, you know, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2827.1000000000004s)]
*  I was about to say strong man, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2830.3s)]
*  but this is clearly the strong woman version. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2831.54s)]
*  Like this brand of politics is just spreading everywhere. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2835.98s)]
*  Right? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2839.46s)]
*  I think also for the United States, look, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2840.5s)]
*  there is a pretty deep, you know, trading relationship [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2842.78s)]
*  and economic relationship. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2846.5s)]
*  And it just begins to raise questions about, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2848.6600000000003s)]
*  hey, like, when are you gonna have to take a step back? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2851.34s)]
*  When, like, I think the US needs to be much more vocal [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2853.6200000000003s)]
*  about this. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2856.2200000000003s)]
*  You rarely hear the US kind of weighing in [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2857.0600000000004s)]
*  on issues in Bangladesh. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2858.9s)]
*  I'm not suggesting we have a ton of leverage [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2861.46s)]
*  to do something other than use our voice [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2863.82s)]
*  and kind of call this out, keep a distance, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2866.6600000000003s)]
*  provide some support as we can as a lifeline [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2870.7400000000002s)]
*  to kind of opposition by speaking out for this, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2874.02s)]
*  by raising it in international forums. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2877.9s)]
*  But yeah, this has taken an increasingly dark turn. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2880.62s)]
*  Yeah, agreed. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2883.98s)]
*  But at the same time, as we talked about with Kenya, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2884.82s)]
*  and this is a much more extreme example, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2887.14s)]
*  that students, it's young people getting on the street. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2889.1s)]
*  So, you know, as we've seen recently, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2891.54s)]
*  the autocratic trend is very powerful, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2895.14s)]
*  but the pushback is getting more powerful too. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2896.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, you know, whether it's the Indian election [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2898.74s)]
*  resolving a surprise next door to Bangladesh, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2901.22s)]
*  whether it's these kinds of protest movements, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2903.98s)]
*  it does feel like there's more and more willingness [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2905.62s)]
*  by people at the ballot box or in the streets [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2909.3799999999997s)]
*  to begin to push back. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2912.58s)]
*  And that's the only hopeful story. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2913.66s)]
*  And they evolve into zero sum contests pretty quickly. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2915.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2918.98s)]
*  You know, you're like, you're not seeing a lot of protests [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2919.8199999999997s)]
*  that are like, we want to get rid of this, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2921.18s)]
*  that tax on some fuel subsidy. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2923.2599999999998s)]
*  It's like, we're sick of this whole thing. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2926.1s)]
*  It's like, let's burn this whole place down. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2927.3399999999997s)]
*  And that part is a little frightening. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2929.22s)]
*  A couple of quick updates from Europe. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2931.18s)]
*  Well, that's true, the danger is like a civil conflict [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2932.5s)]
*  collapse scenario, which would be terrible. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2935.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2937.22s)]
*  So a couple of things from Europe. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2938.14s)]
*  So Ursula von der Leyen secured another five years [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2939.3799999999997s)]
*  as the president of the European Commission, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2942.14s)]
*  the top job in their system. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2944.34s)]
*  We also noticed that across the EU, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2946.5s)]
*  countries are looking at conscription as an option [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2948.34s)]
*  to build up their militaries. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2950.38s)]
*  Sweden was the first to do it, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2951.78s)]
*  but Politico reported that Germany, the UK, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2953.18s)]
*  and the Netherlands might follow suit. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2955.62s)]
*  Just an interesting, I think, byproduct [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2957.62s)]
*  of the Russian invasion of Ukraine [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2959.7s)]
*  in concern that if Trump gets elected, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2961.78s)]
*  he could hobble NATO and that these guys are on their own. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2964.18s)]
*  I think the Trump hedge piece is super interesting. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2966.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it's leading to pretty broad consequences. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2969.42s)]
*  Also, I don't know if you saw this, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2972.5s)]
*  there's a fantastic video circulating [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2973.98s)]
*  from the French National Assembly. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2976.06s)]
*  So by tradition, the first legislative session, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2977.86s)]
*  it's chaired by the oldest representative in parliament [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2981.58s)]
*  and the youngest member acts as that member's secretary. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2984.42s)]
*  So they like stand in the well [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2987.98s)]
*  and they greet everybody who votes. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2989.3s)]
*  It's kind of a weird tradition. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2990.66s)]
*  It is a weird tradition. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2991.5s)]
*  It's a bunch of people walking up to a pot, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2993.06s)]
*  placing paper in there as they vote. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2994.7400000000002s)]
*  And then you're supposed to shake the hand [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2996.26s)]
*  of this youngest member. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=2998.5s)]
*  That member right now is a 22-year-old member [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3000.42s)]
*  of Marine Le Pen's National Rally Party. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3003.42s)]
*  So this guy's standing there waiting to shake [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3005.82s)]
*  everybody's hand as they come through [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3008.38s)]
*  and it didn't quite go that way. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3010.1s)]
*  So all the far left MPs refused to shake this kid's hand. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3011.82s)]
*  One very large Algerian MP got in his face [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3015.94s)]
*  and looked quite menacing. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3020.6600000000003s)]
*  And then the absolute best part, the coup de grâce, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3022.06s)]
*  was one MP extended his hand and then hit him [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3024.54s)]
*  with a little rock, scissors, paper, shoot. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3027.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3030.14s)]
*  Just fucking humiliated this little baby fascist. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3030.9799999999996s)]
*  I love that. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3034.18s)]
*  This baby fascist who looks like he kind of, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3035.02s)]
*  he looks like the kind of fascist adjacent [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3036.8599999999997s)]
*  college Republican type. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3039.54s)]
*  Yes, little T.P. USA kid. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3040.74s)]
*  And I love the panache with which the French [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3042.74s)]
*  are like giving the finger. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3048.4599999999996s)]
*  I mean, they could have done the old, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3049.66s)]
*  I'm dating myself here, like the handshake, woo! [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3051.5s)]
*  Into their hair. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3054.02s)]
*  Yeah, into their hair. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3054.8599999999997s)]
*  But yeah, no, that was a fun watch. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3056.1s)]
*  And the Algerian guy, I'm pretty sure he said, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3058.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna kick your ass there. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3061.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3062.66s)]
*  It was some school yard stuff. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3063.5s)]
*  Then finally, Ben, the Olympics start in Paris, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3064.7799999999997s)]
*  I think on Friday. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3066.98s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3067.8199999999997s)]
*  How pumped are your girls to watch a little gymnastics? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3068.66s)]
*  They're really excited. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3069.8599999999997s)]
*  We watched Simone Biles in one of the warmup competitions, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3071.38s)]
*  or no, actually it was the US trials. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3076.02s)]
*  We watched her floor routine a lot of times, I gotta say. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3079.38s)]
*  So they're super jazzed about the gymnastics. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3082.66s)]
*  My eldest daughter, Ella, swims, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3086.38s)]
*  so she's super into watching swimmers. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3087.9s)]
*  I'm of course gonna try to launder the basketball [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3090.58s)]
*  under the rotation. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3093.42s)]
*  Didn't we almost lose to South Sudan? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3094.94s)]
*  One point. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3096.6600000000003s)]
*  I was kinda rooting for South Sudan. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3098.02s)]
*  Oh, of course, they need to win. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3099.82s)]
*  Yeah, they need to win bad. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3100.7400000000002s)]
*  But yeah, I love the Olympics, I can't wait. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3102.9s)]
*  Hannah told me that there's a Simone Biles [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3105.94s)]
*  two-part documentary on Netflix right now. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3108.1400000000003s)]
*  Yes, there is. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3110.5s)]
*  Yes, there is, actually. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3111.34s)]
*  I'll probably be watching that. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3112.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I figured you'd be watching that [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3113.42s)]
*  if you hadn't already. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3114.54s)]
*  Well, I'm very excited for the Olympics. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3116.02s)]
*  All right, finally, Ben. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3117.58s)]
*  Shark Week might have officially ended a couple weeks ago, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3119.18s)]
*  but it seems that the sharks of Brazil [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3121.52s)]
*  are still going hard at the after party. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3123.74s)]
*  So Brazilian sharp-nosed sharks off the coast [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3125.62s)]
*  of Rio de Janeiro were found to have high levels [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3129.34s)]
*  of cocaine in their systems. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3132.06s)]
*  There's a few ways these sharks could have picked up [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3134.02s)]
*  the drug, run off from illegal labs, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3136.5s)]
*  absorbing the waste of drug users from sewage, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3139.16s)]
*  or their remora fish know a guy who knows a guy. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3141.94s)]
*  Important safety notice, if you or a shark you know [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3145.08s)]
*  corners you and starts monologuing at high speed [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3148.7599999999998s)]
*  about their unwritten screenplay, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3151.2s)]
*  you have to punch them in the nose [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3152.72s)]
*  and then back away slowly. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3154.6s)]
*  That's how you fight off a cocaine shark. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3156.16s)]
*  But my question is, where do these Brazilian sharks [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3158.8199999999997s)]
*  get their money to support this habit? [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3162.12s)]
*  It's pretty expensive. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3164.88s)]
*  And what do they do, what does a shark do? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3165.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, of all the living things that you don't wanna see [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3171.8s)]
*  loaded up with a massive amount of cocaine, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3175.36s)]
*  I kinda feel like a shark is, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3177.76s)]
*  maybe that was the jaw shark, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3179.6400000000003s)]
*  because I was wondering about this shark [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3181.86s)]
*  that all of a sudden is like, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3183.04s)]
*  I'm just gonna eat a boat, you know? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3184.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3186.48s)]
*  It's kind of a wilding shark, you know? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3187.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of 80s too, you know, like grow up. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3189.84s)]
*  It's very 80s, is there a shark party? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3191.84s)]
*  What would it look like if a bunch of sharks [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3195.28s)]
*  got together on cocaine? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3196.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, it's like, it is a movie, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3198.04s)]
*  I mean the movie is just waiting to be made. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3200.92s)]
*  Waiting to be made, I mean they made Cocaine Bear. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3202.36s)]
*  It feels like the sequel, I mean, like, you know, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3204.2799999999997s)]
*  on land on sea, the next one can be like, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3206.52s)]
*  I don't know, Bald Eagle on cocaine or something, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3209.68s)]
*  like so we get, like, in that style. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3211.64s)]
*  Oh, that's a good idea. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3212.48s)]
*  He just comes for you to- [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3213.82s)]
*  Just like, he comes screaming down, like, yeah, yeah. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3214.66s)]
*  Ritz your nose off, try to like extract the cocaine. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3216.0s)]
*  All right, we'll get the WME on the phone [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3218.88s)]
*  and write this thing up. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3221.58s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna take a quick break when we come back. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3222.8s)]
*  You're gonna hear my conversation with Jason Rezaian [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3225.08s)]
*  about his podcast, 544 Days, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3227.52s)]
*  about his experience being held hostage in Iranian prison [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3230.08s)]
*  and how the US government could do more [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3233.48s)]

*  But we're gonna talk about a lot of the issues [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3345.7000000000003s)]
*  related to what Jason discussed in the pod and in his book, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3347.06s)]
*  which involves around this growing trend [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3351.34s)]
*  of hostage taking all over the world. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3353.9s)]
*  So last week, Jason, we saw Wall Street Journal reporter [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3355.3s)]
*  Evan Gurskiewicz was sentenced to 16 years [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3358.7200000000003s)]
*  in a high security penal colony [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3362.1000000000004s)]
*  on completely bullshit espionage charges in Russia. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3363.9s)]
*  Alsuh Khromysheva, a Russian-American journalist [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3367.38s)]
*  who has been detained in Russia for the last nine months [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3369.98s)]
*  was sentenced to six and a half years in some secret trial. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3372.6400000000003s)]
*  We actually spoke with Alsuh's husband, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3376.7400000000002s)]
*  Pavel Butorin, earlier today. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3378.26s)]
*  This is what he told us. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3380.1s)]
*  I mean, no matter what I say, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3381.2400000000002s)]
*  it doesn't quite adequately describe the pain, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3382.58s)]
*  the daily pain that we go through without Alsuh. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3385.1s)]
*  The girls have been without their mother [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3388.42s)]
*  for over a year now. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3390.38s)]
*  And you know, that year, we try to put on a brave face [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3392.06s)]
*  as we go on live TV, but you know, we are hurting. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3395.38s)]
*  It's been a very difficult time for us. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3400.5s)]
*  My communication with Alsuh has been very limited. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3402.9s)]
*  The only time we heard her voice [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3405.5s)]
*  was at a couple of court hearings [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3408.3s)]
*  where she was able to talk to journalists [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3411.78s)]
*  about her horrendous conditions [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3413.5s)]
*  and her inability to speak to her children. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3415.9s)]
*  We know that she was held in a tiny cell, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3418.5s)]
*  sleeping and eating about three feet [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3420.78s)]
*  from a hole in the floor that served as a bathroom. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3423.18s)]
*  It was thanks to our advocacy work [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3425.66s)]
*  that there has been a slight improvement in her conditions. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3428.2599999999998s)]
*  But she is in a very bad place. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3433.54s)]
*  She does not belong in a Russian prison cell. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3435.46s)]
*  She belongs with us at home with the children. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3437.5s)]
*  Jason, I just, you know, I can't imagine [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3441.42s)]
*  what it would be like to have my wife, you know, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3444.58s)]
*  being sentenced to a six-year sentence at a Russian prison. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3446.54s)]
*  I know this is so personal for you, given your experience, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3449.42s)]
*  but I just want to start by asking for your reaction [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3452.58s)]
*  to that clip and these two unjust detentions in Russia. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3455.2599999999998s)]
*  Look, I've met Pavel and their daughters, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3459.22s)]
*  met the parents and sister of Evan Grishkovich [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3463.38s)]
*  and so many other families. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3468.34s)]
*  Pavel's right. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3470.2599999999998s)]
*  She doesn't belong in a Russian prison. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3471.1s)]
*  She belongs at home with her family. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3473.5s)]
*  I think the despair, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3476.2599999999998s)]
*  the sense of grief and heartache [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3478.26s)]
*  and the not knowing really is the worst part [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3485.82s)]
*  of these situations. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3488.9s)]
*  You don't know when it's gonna end, if it's gonna end. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3489.94s)]
*  And, you know, when I heard the news of Evan's verdict [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3494.3s)]
*  and then also on the heels of that, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3501.78s)]
*  I thought to myself, okay, well, this sounds as though, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3504.26s)]
*  you know, there's a concerted effort inside Russia [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3507.06s)]
*  to push the ball forward. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3509.14s)]
*  Now, it's hard to say if that means that there is a deal [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3511.46s)]
*  that's about to be made [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3515.42s)]
*  or they're angling towards a deal being made. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3517.98s)]
*  But one of the things that I remember from my own experience [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3521.7s)]
*  is that this idea of a looming verdict, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3523.9s)]
*  on the one hand, you know that it's an arbitrary number, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3527.54s)]
*  it's meaningless, it's based on nothing, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3530.9s)]
*  but it's also official, right? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3533.94s)]
*  The specter of having to spend 16 years, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3536.3s)]
*  six and a half years in all suitcase in a prison [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3538.98s)]
*  for nothing more than your nationality [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3542.62s)]
*  and the job that you do is fucking ridiculous, right? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3545.22s)]
*  And it's not something that anybody in any country [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3548.7400000000002s)]
*  or any field should have to face, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3552.7s)]
*  which is why I'm out there talking about this issue [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3556.46s)]
*  as much as I can. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3559.5s)]
*  There's several dozen Americans that this affects directly [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3561.06s)]
*  and their families and their communities. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3565.02s)]
*  But that several dozen protracted over the last decade [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3567.34s)]
*  means a couple of hundred people [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3571.98s)]
*  and dozens of congressional districts, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3573.98s)]
*  dozens of companies, communities. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3578.62s)]
*  And, you know, it's gone from sort of an esoteric, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3582.38s)]
*  hard to understand set of problems [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3587.26s)]
*  to one that a majority perhaps of states [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3590.22s)]
*  has had to deal with in the last few years. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3593.5s)]
*  And so I try and convince people, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3596.9s)]
*  hey, look, this is not some kind of weird partisan issue, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3598.78s)]
*  right? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3603.5s)]
*  We either negotiate or we don't negotiate. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3604.34s)]
*  This is an American issue. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3606.78s)]
*  Fellow citizens are being targeted [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3608.58s)]
*  because a growing number of states [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3610.7s)]
*  think that they can extract something of value [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3613.46s)]
*  from our government by holding our fellow Americans hostage. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3615.58s)]
*  For me, that's unacceptable. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3619.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so just for more background for folks, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3623.1s)]
*  the Obama administration was ultimately able [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3625.8599999999997s)]
*  to negotiate your release directly [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3627.8599999999997s)]
*  with the Iranian government. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3629.5s)]
*  There are some people who think that in Evan's case, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3630.7799999999997s)]
*  his sentencing might be viewed by the Russians [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3634.18s)]
*  as a phony but necessary administrative step [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3637.3399999999997s)]
*  that would then allow them to negotiate a prisoner exchange. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3641.98s)]
*  We don't know yet. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3644.94s)]
*  Hopefully that proposition is being tested. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3645.98s)]
*  And obviously US-Russia relations are fraughts, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3648.22s)]
*  to say the least, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3651.82s)]
*  But I know you've also been working with a think tank [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3654.86s)]
*  in Washington called CSIS on policy recommendations [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3657.42s)]
*  for when it comes to hostage taking. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3660.82s)]
*  Can you help us walk us through a few of those? [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3662.78s)]
*  Yeah, so I approached CSIS, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3664.9s)]
*  which is really sort of a center right think tank, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3667.6200000000003s)]
*  a couple of years ago about trying to do some work [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3672.34s)]
*  around this issue. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3676.46s)]
*  And this concept grew into a really extraordinary group [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3678.02s)]
*  of experts from the national security background [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3685.58s)]
*  from State Department, congressional staffers, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3690.26s)]
*  former hostages, relatives of the hostages, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3694.66s)]
*  law enforcement officials, all sorts of people [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3696.9s)]
*  who have experienced this from every angle. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3699.1s)]
*  And it's co-chaired by Senator Jean Shaheen [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3703.26s)]
*  and former national security advisor Robert O'Brien. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3708.18s)]
*  So quite a bipartisan by design pairing. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3710.2599999999998s)]
*  And what we're trying to do is to pinpoint [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3715.94s)]
*  what the motivations are for the states that do this. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3719.22s)]
*  Because historically when we have a problem [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3722.02s)]
*  like hostage taking, which the Biden administration [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3725.2599999999998s)]
*  declared a national emergency back in 2022, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3729.2599999999998s)]
*  when we have these sorts of crises, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3734.14s)]
*  we respond to the most recent iteration, right? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3737.7s)]
*  You'll remember that the Obama administration [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3741.8199999999997s)]
*  did a policy review of hostage taking. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3743.54s)]
*  But that was based primarily on the problem of the moment, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3746.7799999999997s)]
*  which was groups like ISIS or Al-Qaeda [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3750.06s)]
*  taking American hostages. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3752.62s)]
*  Those groups essentially don't exist in the same kind of way [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3754.42s)]
*  that they did back then. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3757.22s)]
*  And they certainly aren't doing this kind of hostage taking. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3758.06s)]
*  But states are, Iran, Russia, China. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3761.66s)]
*  So what we're trying to figure out is one, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3765.34s)]
*  what are the reasons that these governments are doing? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3767.42s)]
*  Two, is there an incentive policy or an incentive, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3770.7s)]
*  a built-in incentive by negotiating [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3777.9s)]
*  for the releases of prisoners? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3779.9s)]
*  I think one of the things that we've come to grips with [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3782.06s)]
*  as a group is people don't come home without concessions. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3785.46s)]
*  Right? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3789.3s)]
*  Deterring this problem moving forward [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3790.14s)]
*  is another issue entirely. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3794.06s)]
*  And we have recommendations on that, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3795.66s)]
*  both at the law enforcement level, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3797.9s)]
*  but also at the commercial level, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3800.22s)]
*  trying to dissuade people from traveling [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3801.8599999999997s)]
*  from certain to certain countries, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3804.2599999999998s)]
*  maybe putting travel taxes on travel to certain countries, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3805.8199999999997s)]
*  countries that you and I might not think of [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3811.66s)]
*  as destinations for Americans, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3813.94s)]
*  but that attract a lot of dual nationals home. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3815.58s)]
*  But really, overall, trying to offer the US government [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3819.1800000000003s)]
*  across the board a series of recommendations [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3824.6600000000003s)]
*  and really some inspiration [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3827.82s)]
*  to think more creatively about this, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3830.1000000000004s)]
*  because it's a problem that's a face humanity [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3831.98s)]
*  for thousands of years, and it ebbs and flows. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3834.1800000000003s)]
*  I think we've successfully put people on the moon. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3838.1000000000004s)]
*  We can fucking figure this out too. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3842.82s)]
*  We can figure this out. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3844.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and listen, you're right that it's a problem [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3845.5800000000004s)]
*  that ebbs and flows, and it's also one where [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3847.7799999999997s)]
*  the criticism of the response [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3850.2599999999998s)]
*  seems to be the same kind of things. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3852.42s)]
*  Like for example, you always hear that [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3854.18s)]
*  hostage negotiations or prisoner swaps [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3857.66s)]
*  lead to more hostage taking. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3860.7s)]
*  There are people right now saying that [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3862.2599999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden's decision to get back [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3865.34s)]
*  a WNBA player named Brittany Greiner [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3867.58s)]
*  is the reason Evan was taken. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3870.66s)]
*  What's your response to that kind of thinking or response? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3872.94s)]
*  My response is first of all, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3876.18s)]
*  there are people who have specialized [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3878.2599999999998s)]
*  in this issue for a long time, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3881.98s)]
*  and no one who specializes in it sees a correlation [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3883.62s)]
*  between negotiated release and more hostage taking. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3887.46s)]
*  The reality is there's nothing standing in Russia or Iran [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3892.58s)]
*  or China's way from doing this. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3897.14s)]
*  They've taken our idea of a free and independent judiciary [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3899.46s)]
*  and used it against us. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3904.94s)]
*  You can remember back in my case, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3908.02s)]
*  there was all sorts of public posturing around the idea [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3911.1s)]
*  that we don't wanna comment on a sovereign nation's [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3914.46s)]
*  judiciary, you know what? [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3919.7s)]
*  I wish folks had commented on it. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3922.62s)]
*  And if you fast forward 10 years, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3925.46s)]
*  some of those same folks, folks that you worked with [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3927.86s)]
*  are out there calling this hostage taking now. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3930.82s)]
*  I think we've kinda ripped the bandaid off. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3933.7s)]
*  A big part of it is calling this what it is [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3936.1s)]
*  and then addressing it. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3939.8599999999997s)]
*  I hear so often, well, we need to let the Russians [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3941.5s)]
*  have a face-saving option. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3945.3399999999997s)]
*  You don't take fucking hostages [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3947.42s)]
*  if you're worried about saving face. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3949.5s)]
*  That's true. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3951.46s)]
*  That's just not part of it. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3952.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly right. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3953.42s)]
*  Look, my reaction to this is exactly yours. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3955.42s)]
*  I feel like a nation's obligation is to protect its people, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3958.46s)]
*  and when someone is taken hostage [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3962.3s)]
*  because of their nationality, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3963.7400000000002s)]
*  then we have an obligation to that individual [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3964.9s)]
*  to get them home. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3966.7000000000003s)]
*  That seems quite obvious to me. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3967.54s)]
*  Otherwise, what's the value of our citizenship? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3969.0600000000004s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3971.26s)]
*  It's on the most basic level. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3972.1400000000003s)]
*  Now, and you're also right that negotiating the release [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3973.9s)]
*  of anyone or negotiating anything [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3977.34s)]
*  involves talking with bad guys and giving up something [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3979.0600000000004s)]
*  in exchange for something. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3982.5s)]
*  And that process is easily demagogued [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3983.54s)]
*  in the political arena. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3985.98s)]
*  But I do think, I'm a partisan hack, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3988.0600000000004s)]
*  but my observation is that Republicans [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3991.18s)]
*  are worse in this stuff. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3993.7799999999997s)]
*  They still attack Obama over the talks with Iran. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3995.02s)]
*  They still attack Obama for negotiating the release [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=3997.58s)]
*  of an American soldier named Bo Bergdahl [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4000.06s)]
*  who was held by the Taliban. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4001.74s)]
*  Trump was just not treated the same way [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4003.74s)]
*  even when he was cutting deals with the Taliban [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4005.7s)]
*  or cutting deals to get- [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4007.8199999999997s)]
*  Or North Korea. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4009.94s)]
*  Yeah, North Korea, or just getting back a famous rapper. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4010.7799999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4013.3399999999997s)]
*  Not from a hostile state, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4014.18s)]
*  but just kind of doing it for political reasons. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4015.14s)]
*  So do you guys have thoughts on how to fix [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4017.02s)]
*  these political incentives? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4018.98s)]
*  Because Robert O'Brien, who you mentioned, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4020.26s)]
*  was a national security advisor for Trump [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4022.0200000000004s)]
*  and was the lead on hostage- [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4024.7000000000003s)]
*  And the hostage boy. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4026.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, before he was national security advisor. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4026.94s)]
*  I mean, he is one of the leading voices [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4029.1400000000003s)]
*  on depoliticizing the issue, right? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4030.98s)]
*  And I think if you were to ask him, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4034.38s)]
*  he would say that he's of the opinion [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4036.98s)]
*  that making financial resources available [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4039.1400000000003s)]
*  to bad actors that do this [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4044.34s)]
*  makes it more likely for them to do it in the future. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4047.86s)]
*  My response to that, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4050.58s)]
*  and I have a very good working relationship [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4052.1400000000003s)]
*  and friendly relationship with him [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4055.26s)]
*  and all of the other commissioners, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4057.86s)]
*  is that if we freeze money from various countries, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4060.42s)]
*  whether it's Iran or Russia or China, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4065.42s)]
*  and dangle it as something that they have an opportunity [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4068.6600000000003s)]
*  to get back if they do X, Y, and Z, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4072.46s)]
*  we should assume that their response is gonna be, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4076.06s)]
*  hey, fuck you, we don't like X, Y, and Z, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4078.7799999999997s)]
*  we're gonna do ABC instead, right? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4081.22s)]
*  And you're still gonna give us our money back. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4083.14s)]
*  That's what they've been doing. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4085.06s)]
*  They've been successful at that. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4086.62s)]
*  So I think if you look at the Iranian instance, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4088.3799999999997s)]
*  the more pots of money that you freeze [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4091.62s)]
*  and make potentially available to them [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4094.8999999999996s)]
*  sometime in the future, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4098.86s)]
*  the more hostage-taking you're gonna see [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4100.26s)]
*  from the Islamic Republic. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4102.22s)]
*  In the Russia case, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4104.66s)]
*  the more true Russian assets that are being picked up, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4106.18s)]
*  whether it's spies or assassins, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4112.0199999999995s)]
*  both of which they've tried to get home in releases, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4116.14s)]
*  and the more Americans who continue to risk everything [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4121.3s)]
*  by entering Russian territory, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4126.22s)]
*  the more American hostages you will see in Russia. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4128.26s)]
*  So I think that there's this other element of it. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4131.22s)]
*  Especially at a time when we see so many people [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4134.66s)]
*  on Instagram or TikTok talking about, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4137.66s)]
*  I'm gonna hit every country. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4140.0599999999995s)]
*  Maybe hit every country except for the six or seven [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4142.74s)]
*  that the State Department has designated [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4145.099999999999s)]
*  as a threat to taking you hostage. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4147.3s)]
*  Yeah, good call. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4149.58s)]
*  Good call there. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4150.66s)]
*  Yeah, I was, listen, all of us did some stupid shit [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4151.5s)]
*  in our 20s, but don't go visit North Korea, guys. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4155.14s)]
*  It's just, it's not worth it. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4158.0599999999995s)]
*  Look, when I feel like it's safe to go back to Iran, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4159.22s)]
*  you and everybody else who's listening [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4161.98s)]
*  and watching, we'll all go together. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4163.74s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4165.62s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be anytime soon. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4166.46s)]
*  No, no, until then, chill out. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4167.3s)]
*  Hamas and other extremist groups took about 250 people [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4169.5s)]
*  hostage on October 7th during the attack on Israel. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4173.0599999999995s)]
*  About 120 hostages are still being held in Gaza, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4176.179999999999s)]
*  though Israeli intelligence reportedly believes [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4179.62s)]
*  that 46 of them may be dead. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4182.099999999999s)]
*  Eight American dual citizen hostages are believed [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4184.9s)]
*  to still be held in Gaza. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4188.099999999999s)]
*  Given how long it's been and given how clear it is [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4190.38s)]
*  that Bibi Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4194.06s)]
*  is just not prioritizing getting these hostages back, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4195.900000000001s)]
*  do you think the Biden administration should be negotiating [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4199.66s)]
*  unilaterally with Hamas or through Qatar or somebody [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4202.54s)]
*  to get Americans home? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4206.42s)]
*  Personally, I do. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4207.42s)]
*  I mean, I think, I don't think it's that Netanyahu [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4208.34s)]
*  doesn't care. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4212.3s)]
*  I think that there's concern that there are people [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4213.46s)]
*  in the Israeli government and within Hamas [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4215.74s)]
*  who wanna elongate the hostage situation [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4218.54s)]
*  for their own political reasons. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4223.54s)]
*  And if those are at odds with Americans coming home, [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4226.26s)]
*  I'm all for us trying to negotiate those releases directly [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4230.62s)]
*  if we can. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4234.9s)]
*  And I think that the Hamas hostage taking of Israelis, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4235.94s)]
*  but also so many other nationalities, right? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4243.42s)]
*  A lot of those people, the 250 plus people [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4246.34s)]
*  were either dual nationals or guest workers. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4248.9800000000005s)]
*  Wanna talk to the State Department about this? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4253.9800000000005s)]
*  Their count was that 40 nationalities were represented [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4256.14s)]
*  in that event. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4260.26s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4261.42s)]
*  And you had babies and you had very elderly people, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4262.62s)]
*  people in their 80s and 90s. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4269.42s)]
*  The horrific audacity of that, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4271.900000000001s)]
*  I think has put this hostage issue in the minds [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4276.34s)]
*  of many more people around the world [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4280.860000000001s)]
*  than it had been in a long time. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4283.1s)]
*  And I think whatever can be done and needs to be done [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4286.18s)]
*  to bring those people home as safely and quickly as possible [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4290.5s)]
*  should be done by our government, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4295.580000000001s)]
*  by those other governments that represent [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4297.820000000001s)]
*  these individuals and frankly by the Israeli government. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4300.38s)]
*  Yeah, I could not agree with you more. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4303.22s)]
*  I think this is a moment when we gotta say, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4305.46s)]
*  Bibi, disagree with you and we're gonna do our own thing here [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4308.66s)]
*  because you're not getting it done. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4311.58s)]
*  Jason, when I think back on 544 days in your podcast [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4314.7s)]
*  about your experience and since that time, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4319.860000000001s)]
*  how much hostage issues have driven [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4323.42s)]
*  not just American foreign policy challenges, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4326.62s)]
*  but global ones? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4329.38s)]
*  It feels like it was ahead of the curve in some ways. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4330.38s)]
*  I mean, do you think you were just like [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4333.26s)]
*  in this really unfortunate place to be at the leading edge [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4334.9800000000005s)]
*  of this trend growing again or like, why is that? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4338.9400000000005s)]
*  And what do you think people can learn from the show today [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4342.54s)]
*  about what's happening now? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4345.1s)]
*  So I do think that what happened to me was the beginning [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4346.78s)]
*  or at the beginning of a new wave of this. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4351.5s)]
*  And as soon as I was released, within a couple of months, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4356.1s)]
*  Nazanin Zagari Radcliffe, this young British Iranian woman [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4362.26s)]
*  who had a daughter who was only two at the time, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4366.1s)]
*  was taken by the same goons that took me, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4370.900000000001s)]
*  very similar circumstances. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4373.620000000001s)]
*  And I connected with her husband, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4376.46s)]
*  who was a British man in the UK, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4381.46s)]
*  and then there were others, right? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4386.1s)]
*  And then there were cases in Venezuela and Russia. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4389.34s)]
*  And I was really banging this drum that, hey, look, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4392.5s)]
*  this is a problem that's getting worse and worse [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4397.02s)]
*  and it's no longer these terrorist organizations [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4399.18s)]
*  and criminal gangs doing this. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4402.54s)]
*  Yes, they still do it, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4404.660000000001s)]
*  but the main perpetrator is governments. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4405.780000000001s)]
*  And so I think, yeah, we were a little bit ahead [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4409.9800000000005s)]
*  of the curve in calling this out. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4412.7s)]
*  And I'm thankful that the US government, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4415.54s)]
*  the Canadian government, the UK government, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4418.139999999999s)]
*  started to catch up. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4420.34s)]
*  But I think that the European governments [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4421.62s)]
*  are still fumbling around trying to figure out [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4422.98s)]
*  how to respond to this. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4426.099999999999s)]
*  But I've been really encouraged by the community of people [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4428.179999999999s)]
*  who've been affected by this, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4432.22s)]
*  who've come together to try and figure out effective ways [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4434.54s)]
*  to combat it. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4437.98s)]
*  And in terms of the podcast, I mean, look, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4440.179999999999s)]
*  I tell people, it's the best podcast [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4443.38s)]
*  you may never have heard, right? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4446.06s)]
*  I agree. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4447.62s)]
*  It's a really good show, right? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4448.46s)]
*  And I think if you listen to it today, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4449.5s)]
*  it'll tell you a lot about what's going on [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4454.0199999999995s)]
*  in these hostage situations. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4457.1s)]
*  Also, we had this great, incredible fortune [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4459.34s)]
*  of interviewing a series of Obama-era officials [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4463.26s)]
*  who all have much bigger jobs in the Biden administration [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4469.26s)]
*  who you can't get two minutes with now, right? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4473.820000000001s)]
*  And I think it's very reflective of their positions [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4476.18s)]
*  on foreign policy. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4480.34s)]
*  And I don't know, I just think it's a really good [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4481.42s)]
*  historical document. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4483.74s)]
*  I thank you and the guys for believing in it. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4484.820000000001s)]
*  Oh my God, I mean, it was an honor to work on it with you, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4487.66s)]
*  but you're right. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4490.3s)]
*  I mean, when you think about some of the names of people [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4491.14s)]
*  that worked on your case, I mean, they're, you know, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4493.820000000001s)]
*  some of the top folks on the Biden team, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4497.06s)]
*  but also, I mean, I think what I really took away [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4499.700000000001s)]
*  from the show was you hear about these cases, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4502.22s)]
*  you hear about Evan or, you know, other names, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4505.34s)]
*  and they become, you know, people on the news, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4507.540000000001s)]
*  but to hear you and to hear your wife, Yaggy, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4511.820000000001s)]
*  who was also held by the same, you know, IRGC goons [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4513.740000000001s)]
*  for a long period of time, like talk about the impact [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4517.26s)]
*  on you on just a human level, like how frightening it was, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4520.22s)]
*  what it was like to get out, I think is, you know, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4523.740000000001s)]
*  an incredible window into an experience, you know, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4526.26s)]
*  I wouldn't wish on anybody. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4528.74s)]
*  I think that for us being able to share that [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4530.1s)]
*  and then just kind of give a little bit of background [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4534.820000000001s)]
*  on the production of that show for people, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4536.820000000001s)]
*  we started recording, I think the first interview I did [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4542.02s)]
*  was with Ben, and it was maybe four or five days [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4544.42s)]
*  before lockdown here in DC. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4548.9400000000005s)]
*  And, you know, so then I'm doing all of these interviews [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4551.9400000000005s)]
*  in my basement. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4555.18s)]
*  From the closet. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4556.02s)]
*  You know, with John, from the closet with John Kerry, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4556.860000000001s)]
*  right, and Yaggy, you know, was pregnant [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4558.9800000000005s)]
*  during that whole time. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4564.38s)]
*  So, you know, a lot of nights spent on the living room couch [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4565.3s)]
*  after dinner with her feet up saying, okay, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4570.34s)]
*  I'm gonna, you know, I'm gonna roll the tape now, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4573.26s)]
*  you ready to talk? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4575.38s)]
*  And I think that that intimacy really filters through. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4576.38s)]
*  Yeah, then you're retracking the, you know, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4581.38s)]
*  four week old crying in the background thinking, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4584.54s)]
*  why did I ever sign up for this shit? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4586.34s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4587.740000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4589.46s)]
*  Been there, my friend. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4590.3s)]
*  Final question for you. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4591.62s)]
*  I mean, you are an Iran expert on top of, you know, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4592.54s)]
*  all this expertise in hostage policy. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4595.62s)]
*  Iran has a president-elect who's viewed as a reformer [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4598.9400000000005s)]
*  for the first time since 2005. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4602.26s)]
*  Do you have, how much hope do you have for a change? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4605.14s)]
*  My hope for change in Iran is driven by my faith [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4608.02s)]
*  in the people of Iran. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4612.5s)]
*  It's an incredibly educated, highly civilized and cultured [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4614.66s)]
*  and angry population, right? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4621.18s)]
*  And they've been fed lots of promises from lots of people [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4622.9400000000005s)]
*  over the last couple of decades. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4627.54s)]
*  And I think that they're really at their wits end. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4630.18s)]
*  I think that the president-elect Pesach Kian [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4635.5s)]
*  will say a lot of the right things [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4641.900000000001s)]
*  and that he will be open to engagement and outreach [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4643.42s)]
*  with the West and specifically the United States. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4647.7s)]
*  I don't think that we should think of him [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4650.34s)]
*  as a real driver of change. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4651.9s)]
*  But the one wild card in all this is that [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4654.42s)]
*  Iran's supreme leader is 85 years old. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4656.7s)]
*  He's getting up there. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4658.7s)]
*  He's getting up there. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4660.1s)]
*  I mean, these clerics tend to live for a very long time, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4660.9800000000005s)]
*  but you know, not forever as far as I know. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4664.42s)]
*  And when he dies, there will be an inevitable [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4668.62s)]
*  push and pull for power and a struggle inside that country. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4675.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think we have to look to him [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4679.22s)]
*  as sort of a potential Gorbachev type figure, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4681.7s)]
*  not someone who is a firm believer in the idea [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4685.34s)]
*  of changing things up, but one who reluctantly realizes [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4689.5s)]
*  that the tide of history might be turning against [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4694.26s)]
*  the system that he helped propped up for a very long time. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4696.46s)]
*  That's my hope. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4700.18s)]
*  And that's the lens I'm gonna look through. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4701.02s)]
*  I like that. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4703.78s)]
*  I like that hopeful lens. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4704.62s)]
*  Well, as in everyone should check out Jason's book, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4705.66s)]
*  Prisoner, in this podcast, 544 Days. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4707.94s)]
*  Jason Rezayan, great to see you. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4711.38s)]
*  Thanks, Tommy. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4712.7s)]
*  Thanks again to Jason Rezayan for joining the show [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4713.54s)]
*  and to all you cocaine sharks out there. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4716.42s)]
*  Get help. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4719.26s)]
*  You know, it's not too late. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4720.1s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, like there's booze, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4721.38s)]
*  like there's, you know, there's other things you can, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4724.38s)]
*  a little slightly less, you know, like little ketamine, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4727.06s)]
*  you know. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4729.34s)]
*  Yeah, like one of those puffer fish. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4730.66s)]
*  Maybe like MDMA sharks. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4731.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4733.9800000000005s)]
*  I would rather get some rolling sharks. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4734.900000000001s)]
*  Just some kind of chill rolling sharks. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4736.7s)]
*  You know, that'd be better. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4738.34s)]
*  They just hug you. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4739.18s)]
*  And they go away, rub their fins against you. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4740.02s)]
*  Did you see the video of the crazy seals, sea lions, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4744.18s)]
*  like attacking people on the beach in San Diego? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4747.7s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta not get too close to those things. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4750.22s)]
*  Is that a cocaine seal or like a? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4751.54s)]
*  I think that's a get the hell out of my house seal. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4753.22s)]
*  The scary one are the orcas [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4756.22s)]
*  that are fucking up boats off the Azores. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4758.02s)]
*  I don't wanna fuck with any orcas. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4760.18s)]
*  If orcas decided they didn't like us, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4761.38s)]
*  kind of as a general policy, we'd be in trouble. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4763.62s)]
*  So let's not let that happen. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4766.62s)]
*  All right, talk to you guys next week. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4768.26s)]
*  See ya. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anK4MrbtQVA&t=4769.740000000001s)]
