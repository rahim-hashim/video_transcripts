Video Description: Tommy Vietor and Ben Rhodes talk about the gutting of Israel’s judicial system, and the (lack of) response from the US. They also discuss good-ish news from the elections in Spain, a US soldier who fled to North Korea, Putin’s crackdown on a far-rigth blogger, how Ron DeSantis and Senator Tommy Tuberville are hurting military recruiting, the UK’s fight with Apple, Saudi Arabia’s $1.1 billion soccer star, and doggie DNA passports in France. Then Ben talks to best friend of the pod Samantha Power, administrator of the US Agency for International Development about her recent visit to Ukraine, and the impacts of Russia pulling out of a vital grain initiative.

# Israel Passes Law Weakening its Supreme Court Sparking More Civil Unrest & Mass Protests
**Pod Save the World:** [July 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc)
*  Welcome back to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Ben Rhodes. Ben, my daughter rolled over from her belly to her back this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=0.0s)]
*  Congratulations. And you would have thought she passed the bar exam. She, I mean... That was a reaction. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=7.84s)]
*  Kind of like some people might say it's a great achievement. It was, it was impressive. I was very proud of her. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=11.92s)]
*  It's just the beginning of a long series of very exciting milestones. Long series of milestones and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=17.36s)]
*  one of the first of many child colds. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=23.2s)]
*  Sort of tearing through the house. Many. Let's put an emphasis on many. I'm sorry to tell you that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=26.32s)]
*  You were just informing me that I'll be sick for the next three years. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the stomach bugs are the ones that caught me off guard because I didn't used to get those and suddenly when my kid went to daycare, especially, it was like, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=32.56s)]
*  it was like all hell broke loose in my household. It was like living in Florida with Ron DeSantis lifting, lifting shutdowns. It was not good. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=39.36s)]
*  Oh, man. Speaking of not good, we got a lot of stories to cover today, Ben. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=46.96s)]
*  We're going to start with Bibi Netanyahu's effort to gut the power of Israel's Supreme Court in the US response or non-response as it were. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=51.04s)]
*  The better than expected elections in Spain. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  The US soldier who ran across the DMZ into North Korea. Putin's arrest of a far-right telegram influencer. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=63.28s)]
*  Ron DeSantis in the military. Apple and privacy in the UK and a bunch of other issues including [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  Kylina Mbappe's 1.1 billion dollar transfer offer. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=75.11999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's making even my Mets payroll look small. That's a lot of cash. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  And then you guys are going to hear Ben's conversation with, dare I say, a best friend of the show. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  I said that. I introduced her as the best friend of the pod. See, I didn't hear that. Sympotico. Samantha Power, USAID administrator. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so Samantha was just in Ukraine. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=96.8s)]
*  And so we talked about the the Russian obstruction or withdrawal and obstruction of the Grain Initiative, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=99.44s)]
*  which was one of the focal points for Tripp. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=106.96s)]
*  A pretty harrowing description of going to Odessa. Samantha was one of the first, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=109.44s)]
*  maybe the first senior US official to get out of Kiev and get down to Odessa, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=113.44s)]
*  which also came under attack kind of while she was there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=117.92s)]
*  We talk a bit about [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=121.2s)]
*  how she's looking at the [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=122.8s)]
*  Republican opposition to funding for Ukraine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  What's her take on that? And also like how she answers some of the criticism that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=129.68s)]
*  Ukraine is taking up so much of US bandwidth relative to other parts of the world. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a great interview as always. I learned a lot. It's a great explainer on what's happening with the Grain Initiative. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=137.04s)]
*  It's a great window into what it's like to be in Ukraine right now. And [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=143.92s)]
*  her dog, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  you know, USAID administrators are just like us. Her dog was barking in the background a bit. I think he did not like [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=150.0s)]
*  my question about withdrawing assistance from Ukraine, the Republican party. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=156.32s)]
*  Stick around for that. Yeah, listen to the dog. We have a dog related story at the very back of this show. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=160.56s)]
*  I will say, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=165.27999999999997s)]
*  oh, and she made news. She announced a new initiative. So we have to wait for that. Stick around for that. It is [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=167.11999999999998s)]
*  a pretty gutsy decision to go to Odessa. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=173.04s)]
*  I think Odessa is a port city. A lot of the grain comes out of there. A lot of shipping goes in and out of Odessa. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=176.56s)]
*  And I think the Russians thought we're going to take Odessa. Let's not blow up the infrastructure. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=181.11999999999998s)]
*  And now since the Grain Initiative blew up, they are bombing the shit out of Odessa. And I imagine it's pretty scary. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=184.72s)]
*  That's exactly what Sam was saying. They kind of didn't bomb this infrastructure [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=191.6s)]
*  during the course of the Grain Initiative because they were a part of that obviously. But since they've pulled out, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  not only is that bad for the Grain Initiative, but it's put [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=201.92s)]
*  Odessa tragically back in the crosshairs. Terrible. Should we get to the news? Let's do it. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=205.68s)]
*  So this week Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  finally succeeded in ramming through the first part of what could be a three-part overhaul to Israel's judicial system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=213.36s)]
*  So on Monday, the coalition [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=220.24s)]
*  voted to get rid of the reasonableness standard, which is a process that allows the Israeli Supreme Court to invalidate both [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  appointments and policy decisions made by the government. Now, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=229.42000000000002s)]
*  you might hear this Ben think, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=233.28s)]
*  random court deciding, or not random, the Supreme Court deciding if something is reasonable or not sounds a bit subjective. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=235.76s)]
*  I think Bibi Netanyahu would agree with you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=241.44s)]
*  I think some liberals would say there's room to reform the reasonableness standard. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=243.04s)]
*  But to understand how it works, the courts use the reasonableness standard to look at decisions made by the government [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=246.4s)]
*  to say, was it the right people deciding? Right? The transportation minister isn't making like an education policy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=253.28s)]
*  Was it the right process? Was it done in accordance with Israeli case law? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=258.64s)]
*  The standard is very rarely used when it comes to these policy decisions. My guy Amir Tibon from Kharretz, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  not the best one I've done. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=269.44s)]
*  We were DMing this morning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=271.12s)]
*  He said the most famous case where reasonableness was invoked on policy happened in 2006 [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=272.32s)]
*  when the government adopted a policy to provide bomb shelters to schools near [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=277.44s)]
*  the border with Gaza and then decided not to implement their own policy [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=281.2s)]
*  and refused to build the bomb shelters because there wasn't enough money. So residents sued. The Supreme Court said, yeah, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=284.8s)]
*  that's unreasonable, extremely unreasonable to leave a bunch of kids without bomb shelters in contravention of your own policy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=291.12s)]
*  But the reasonableness standard is more frequently used when it comes to appointments and that is critical because Israel doesn't have a senate to vet [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=298.48s)]
*  appointments like we do with nominees. The government appoints ministers and the reasonableness standard is the only way to prevent [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=305.5s)]
*  unqualified people from getting those jobs. A recent example was back in January. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu tried to install a guy named Arya Dheri, the leader of the right-wing ultra-orthodox [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=316.32000000000005s)]
*  Shah's party to be his interior and health minister, even though this same guy had had the same job and repeatedly committed crimes [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=321.12s)]
*  while in office and had to cut a plea agreement saying you'd never serve in public office again if... [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  Seems disqualified. Yeah, so long explanation there. Seems unreasonable. Seems unreasonable to me too. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=333.92s)]
*  The big question is what comes next. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=339.20000000000005s)]
*  I was talking with my guy Yair Rosenberg at the Atlantic this morning about this. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=341.68s)]
*  He said everyone is basically waiting to see what the Supreme Court itself does because they could invalidate [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=346.24s)]
*  the Knesset's move to get rid of the reasonableness standard and then it's like [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=352.24s)]
*  brave new world. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=356.24s)]
*  If the change is implemented, the question becomes, did the protests continue? Is there a strike? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=358.08s)]
*  Does the military not show up for service? And does Bibi continue to push through the rest of these judicial reforms? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  So that's my very long-winded lay of the land, but I want to shut up and get your reaction to all this madness. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, I look I think this is really bad [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  for a couple reasons. I mean the first is, you know, as we discussed in our special episode on Israel and as [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=376.4s)]
*  Max Fisher, you know, emphasized in that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=383.2s)]
*  episode, Israel doesn't have a constitution like the United States has a written constitution. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=385.91999999999996s)]
*  So they don't have [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  built-in checks and balances in the same way that we do. They have a single legislature that can [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=393.92s)]
*  S it, right? So not a house and a Senate, just one legislative body and a prime minister [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=399.12s)]
*  who's the leader of the coalition that has a majority in that body. And so [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=403.12s)]
*  if the prime minister can hold together his coalition in a vote, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  literally the only check whatsoever on the power of that coalition, which by the way, as was pointed out in your very good interview last week, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=411.2s)]
*  was elected with a minority of votes, right? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  The Supreme Court, the courts are the only [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=423.6s)]
*  check on what that coalition can do. And so the reasonable, you know, withdrawing like one major brick of a check [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=427.68s)]
*  on that body [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=435.44s)]
*  is basically beginning to dismantle any check and balance on what is the most far-right government in Israel's history, right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=437.44s)]
*  So if you are an Israeli who is, you know, not represented in that coalition, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=445.36s)]
*  if you are an Arab Israeli citizen who's worried about your rights being taken away, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=450.8s)]
*  never mind if you're a Palestinian who's worried about the expansion of settlements that the court has sometimes blocked, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=454.8s)]
*  you're waking up today much more concerned. Absolutely. That there's no voice for you in the system and that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  in, as in an autocratic system, if the autocrat, in this case Bibi and his extreme coalition, decide to do things you don't like, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  you have nowhere to turn. There's no recourse here, you know? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=473.44s)]
*  And so that's the first point. And the second point I make is you have to look at the intent of the people making the reforms. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=476.32s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. These are not good government types. You're like, yeah, there's a better way of doing the reasonable and standard. And they are open about it. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=482.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, these are people who are very open about the fact that they want to turn Israel into a full-bore, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=487.2s)]
*  religious, ethno-nationalist state, right? In which, you know, Arab Israeli citizens are second-class citizens, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=493.76s)]
*  in which a two-state solution is eviscerated and in which a hyper kind of religious agenda [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=500.16s)]
*  dominates over some of the more secular identity of Israel manifested in places like Tel Aviv. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  And so the intent matters here because their intent is not to reform something that could work better. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=511.6s)]
*  Their intent is to do the same thing that, like, a Viktor Orbán has done in Hungary, which is to eke through an electoral victory, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=516.88s)]
*  frankly, Orbán won by more than they did, and then methodically dismantle any checks and balances so that they can essentially [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=524.72s)]
*  transform the nature of Israel from a democracy to an illiberal [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  autocracy. And, you know, that sounds alarmist. And sure, if they stopped here, it's bad and could be worse. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=535.66s)]
*  But like, why would they stop here? Like, I just didn't... They keep telling us what they're going to do. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=542.7199999999999s)]
*  That's right. They keep telling us that they're going to ram through all this crap, you know. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=547.28s)]
*  The reason you're not at all alarmist is because [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=550.16s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu is usually savvy, I think, got pushed along by an even more right-wing coalition and tried to do [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=552.9599999999999s)]
*  not just this little piece of his judicial reform, but try to do the whole thing at once, which included [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=558.64s)]
*  changing how judges are chosen to get the ruling party more control over how [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=564.0799999999999s)]
*  picking those judges... First thing that Orbán did, by the way, after he took power in 2014. Yeah, it's the same playbook. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=568.16s)]
*  And then the Netanyahu coalition wanted to pass a law that said assemble majority in the Knesset can overrule a Supreme Court decision. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=574.4s)]
*  So basically, there's no point in having a Supreme Court. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=579.92s)]
*  There's also sort of like a class element to this. If you read a lot of the reporting, the courts are more liberal. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=582.48s)]
*  They're seen as more educated. So are some of the striking people, by the way, like Air Force pilots. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=587.12s)]
*  And Bibi's coalition is this kind of like right-wing orthodox, kind of MAGA-like, if we're being honest, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=591.36s)]
*  group of people. And there's a real question of whether Netanyahu is losing control. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=596.4s)]
*  There's this now kind of iconic image of Bibi sitting in the Knesset. On his one side is his defense minister, on the other is [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=600.72s)]
*  the justice minister. And they're just screaming over him about these changes. And he's [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=607.12s)]
*  sitting there and he literally just had a pacemaker put in during all of this. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=612.64s)]
*  Like that didn't slow this psychopath down. So I think the thing a lot of people are wondering is [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=615.84s)]
*  what comes next, right? Does he fire, does Netanyahu, who is facing three corruption cases, does he fire the attorney general? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=621.28s)]
*  Do they, does he strip away some power from the attorney general? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=627.6s)]
*  Do these protests continue? There are 28 weeks of protests. And, you know, last night or two nights ago, Ben, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=630.56s)]
*  there were images of these protesters getting brutalized in ways that frankly looked like how security forces treat Palestinians in the occupied territories [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=636.56s)]
*  daily. Yeah. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  First of all with Netanyahu, like you have to remember that this man is above all usually interested in the perpetuation of his own power. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=646.88s)]
*  And at every single turn in his career, he has always chosen [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=652.96s)]
*  the right, and I mean right in the political sense, rightward pathway to cling to power. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=657.36s)]
*  There's nothing about Bibi Netanyahu that suggests that at some moment [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=662.4s)]
*  he's going to stand up and, you know, discipline the far-right members of his coalition and take the greater interest of Israel at heart. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=665.6s)]
*  He's cast his lot with a bunch of extremists, and we've detailed how extremists these people are [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=673.36s)]
*  repeatedly. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=678.86s)]
*  But that's the direction he's going, and there's no reason to think, he's been telling us [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=680.24s)]
*  who he is for a very long time. Since the 90s. Yeah, and one of the things that's so frustrating to me, and I've ran about it [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=685.12s)]
*  before, so I'll just mini-rand about it now, is that like if you said these things out loud, if you said 10 years ago [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=690.72s)]
*  or 15 years ago, this guy is a far-right politician who has no interest in a Palestinian state [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=696.48s)]
*  and no interest in Israeli democracy relative to his own power, it was like, oh god, how dare you say that? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=702.08s)]
*  How can you insult our sacrosanct ally Israel? No, it's not about Israel, the people, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=706.5600000000001s)]
*  it's about this guy and his coalition. They're a bunch of far-right people that are interested in dismantling Israeli democracy. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=712.1600000000001s)]
*  They tell us this over and over and over again, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=718.48s)]
*  and we just kind of choose not to hear it, or we choose to think that somehow [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  that moment that momentum is going to get arrested on its own. It's not. This is what's happening. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=725.52s)]
*  They didn't care that these people protested. Sure, it slowed it down, but didn't stop them from doing what they want to do. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  The other thing, you make this really important point, the images are chilling. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=735.52s)]
*  It's like people with water hoses, you know, security forces clearing squares without regard to kind of the safety of some of the people beating people. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=738.64s)]
*  Look, occupation, military occupation, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=747.6s)]
*  for decades that has gotten worse of Palestinian territories. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=751.12s)]
*  I mean, this is, you know, a provocative statement I've seen a number of people make, but I think it's true. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  That was always going to come into Israel. It's the training ground for where security forces work. If this becomes, if you normalize [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=760.24s)]
*  treating other human beings that way, and if you normalize a kind of securitization [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  of a kind of national spread of politics, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=771.52s)]
*  that was ultimately going to migrate from the West Bank to Israel proper, and that's exactly what's happened. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=774.0s)]
*  And as you pointed out, this is a diverse country, right? Just because it's a Jewish state, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=778.72s)]
*  not only is it diverse in the sense that they're Arab [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=783.6800000000001s)]
*  citizens of Israel and Christian Muslim citizens of Israel, but also like the difference between, you know, a [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=786.2399999999999s)]
*  a liberal, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=793.92s)]
*  somewhat secular Jew in Tel Aviv and like a settler, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=795.76s)]
*  an ultra-Orthodox settler, is the same as the difference between someone sitting here in Hollywood and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=800.8s)]
*  somebody, you know, in, you know, rural West Virginia, like who has like 20 guns, right? And [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=806.9599999999999s)]
*  so this is [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=813.3599999999999s)]
*  this is fundamentally an effort to alter the character of the state of Israel more than anything that I think we've seen in our [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=815.68s)]
*  lifetimes, and it's happening, and it will take [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=822.0799999999999s)]
*  probably the only thing that could stop it is if these protests continue at a scale, and if, and I know we get to this, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=826.4s)]
*  there's some external pressure [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=832.2399999999999s)]
*  that slows the process down. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=834.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I agree with that. So let's talk about the US response, because, you know, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=835.68s)]
*  I think the first thing we're all watching is what the Supreme Court does, but also everyone is watching what the US does. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=839.52s)]
*  I mean, not just in the US and Israel, but globally. This episode of Paz de [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=843.84s)]

*  crooked world. Last week, President Biden invited Bibi Netanyahu to the US. They had a phone call where apparently they talked about the judicial coup. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=996.0s)]
*  True to form, Ben, Netanyahu put out this [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1002.88s)]
*  misreading, misleading readout of this call that made it seem like Biden no longer objected to the judicial changes. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1005.76s)]
*  So in response, the White House got pissed. They called in Tom Friedman to talk to Biden for an hour. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1012.5600000000001s)]
*  That's just funny when you say that a lot. To make clear that Biden- [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1018.32s)]
*  They were like playing the role of cab driver. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  The world is flat. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1023.84s)]
*  They call in Friedman to do an interview with Biden to clarify [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1026.16s)]
*  Biden's positions and make clear that Biden is not happy about Bibi ramming through these changes. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1030.24s)]
*  They have no popular support, etc. They also gave a statement to Barack revealed at Axios to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1034.8s)]
*  US-based outlets. I think it might have been good also to talk to Haaretz, you know, right in power like a progressive- [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1040.32s)]
*  Barack's old employer. Yeah, you're right. But like listen, no shade of those two. But so of course, you know Netanyahu [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1046.48s)]
*  ignores Biden's advice to slow down and push us through the changes anyways. So the question is how does the US respond? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1052.0s)]
*  Two former US ambassadors to Israel told Nick Kristof at the New York Times [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  that it's time for the US to cut military aid to Israel. They argue that Israel's economy is strong. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1062.64s)]
*  They don't need aid and that the US doesn't get any leverage or influence over Israeli decisions about the use of force from that aid [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1067.92s)]
*  and that we are seen as enablers of the occupation. I think all of that is unequivocally true. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1076.0800000000002s)]
*  But the White House has signaled that we should not expect any consequences in response to this first [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1081.76s)]
*  ditching of the reasonableness standard and Biden tends to bend over backwards to avoid public fights with Netanyahu. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1088.48s)]
*  So it gets us to this question of leverage. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  I will admit then like hand up that like I [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1098.64s)]
*  was very annoyed that there wasn't more public pressure on Bibi in part because I don't like him. I think he's a racist corrupt [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1102.0s)]
*  person and a bad leader. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1108.8000000000002s)]
*  I guess it's unknowable if more US pressure would have stopped him or stopped this [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1110.8000000000002s)]
*  given that Bibi's kind of captive of his coalition to some extent, but I think it would have been worth trying. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1115.6799999999998s)]
*  And I don't like the idea of the US not standing up for I don't know democratic values or treating Bibi with kid gloves when you've got [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1122.24s)]
*  protesters on the street for 28 weeks getting the shit kicked out of them who who are holding up signs saying Biden save us. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1128.08s)]
*  So I do think more could have been done here, but I don't know you got a hot take. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1134.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I mean my hot take is like let's roll back the tape and look at what happened in the couple weeks leading up to this [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1139.04s)]
*  transformative moment for Israeli democracy where a far-right [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1145.02s)]
*  ethno-nationalist coalition that is determined to eradicate any potential of a Palestinian state rammed through their changes. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1148.8200000000002s)]
*  We welcome the Israeli president, Bougie Herzog, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1156.5800000000002s)]
*  to address a joint session of Congress in which there was kind of a [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1160.5s)]
*  you know the normal you know competition to show how much you were devoted to applaud any platitude about [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1164.98s)]
*  Israel and the US being shared values blah blah blah blah. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1172.02s)]
*  There was an invitation extended to Bibi Netanyahu to visit the White House by Joe Biden. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1175.7s)]
*  So despite the readout to Tom Friedman, like I think the fact that [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1183.3s)]
*  right in the middle of this debate, you know Bibi's invited to Washington to the Oval Office sends a much more powerful [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1187.94s)]
*  message than [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1194.5s)]
*  you know, like a phone call to Tom Friedman. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1195.8600000000001s)]
*  And the US Congress including [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1199.14s)]
*  overwhelming support from the Democratic Party passed a stupid and pointless resolution [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1202.16s)]
*  about Israel not being racist or something to kind of brush back representative Jayapal. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1207.54s)]
*  You know like which I'm not endorsing what you said, but is that really like they could have passed a resolution [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1212.74s)]
*  saying that Israel should not do this. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1218.74s)]
*  Like like what is accomplished by passing the message from that resolution, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1220.98s)]
*  the message from that invitation to Bibi and the message from the way that Boudjie Herzog who I you know [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1224.74s)]
*  like a lot more than Bibi, so it's not against him, but like the collective messages [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1229.22s)]
*  the politics in this country are no different today than they were five, ten, fifteen, twenty years ago. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1233.38s)]
*  In fact, they are ever more in the direction of whatever [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1238.66s)]
*  APAC or pro [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1242.24s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu people in Washington want which is that we unconditionally say Israel can do whatever the fuck it wants and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1244.26s)]
*  the only thing that US politicians are going to do is compete with one another to hug these people no matter what they do, right? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1251.7s)]
*  That's not what we should be doing. Oh and but at the same time like the the the Barak Ravid and you know, I when I was in [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1258.42s)]
*  government I used to call Barak Ravid and read him out. He's a great reporter. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1265.38s)]
*  Yeah, he's a great reporter, but like that's such an elite insular conversation, right? That is like Tom Friedman, Barak Ravid. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1268.0200000000002s)]
*  That's like you're talking to you know, a very small number of people who follow this thing closely. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1274.18s)]
*  It's not like reaching a wide audience. That's a way of kind of covering your tracks with like a certain elite conversation. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1278.4199999999998s)]
*  What can you do? Disinvite Bibi Netanyahu, right? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1285.4599999999998s)]
*  Criticize this much more forthrightly. Say that we are going to be looking at our assistance relationship based on the direction of [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1288.58s)]
*  Israel's democracy. If you and I way back in you know, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1294.8999999999999s)]
*  2019 I think were at a J Street conference asking every Democratic presidential candidate whether that we could get [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  whether they would condition assistance on things like annexing the West Bank. Like this should be on the table too. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1305.94s)]
*  Absolutely. This is the number one recipient of US foreign assistance in the world. I guess, you know, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1311.3s)]
*  Ukraine right now is more, but in terms of regular basis, we're talking on order of nearly four billion dollars, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1315.94s)]
*  if not more than that a year. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1320.18s)]
*  We should not we should say we're not going to give you all that assistance if you ran through the rest of these reforms. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1322.18s)]
*  Like why not? Like if we're for democracy, if our entire [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1327.06s)]
*  foreign policy is about democracies versus autocracies, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1331.7s)]
*  why would we continue to subsidize a government that is going down the path of autocracy? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1334.5s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. And by the way, it's not like they are a poor country that isn't desperate to eat that money. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1339.78s)]
*  It's a wealthy country that we give money to to prove something, you know, like so I think everything, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1344.74s)]
*  you know, like we're not going to ever not, you know, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1351.6200000000001s)]
*  not suggesting we like terminate this, you know, tomorrow. I'm saying we have all these [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1354.58s)]
*  points of leverage. People say, well, we don't really have leverage. We've never tried to use it. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1359.46s)]
*  You don't talk about it. Yeah. Well, and [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1362.98s)]
*  you know, there is the response you hear a lot is [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1365.94s)]
*  the U.S. should not be meddling in or talking about domestic Israeli political matters. And the reason I think that is [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1369.78s)]
*  silly is because we all know what in total these changes to the Israeli judicial system would do [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1376.9s)]
*  and what they would allow, which is full annexation of the West Bank, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1383.3000000000002s)]
*  the continued occupation, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1387.14s)]
*  all kinds of challenges that is, as Amir T-Bone said last week, would arrive on the U.S. doorstep pretty quickly. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1389.7s)]
*  The same and the other thing that's a very good point, which is that these domestic changes are going to change their foreign policy, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1396.18s)]
*  right, as relates to Palestinians and other things. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1401.94s)]
*  I'd also say the people that make this argument constantly about how we should never meddle in Israel's domestic politics had no problem with Bibi Netanyahu [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1404.66s)]
*  constantly meddling in American politics, right? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1411.78s)]
*  Literally coming here without the invitation of a U.S. president to address Congress to oppose [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1414.02s)]
*  Barack Obama's signature foreign policy at the time. And that's not the only time that Bibi Netanyahu is meddled in U.S. politics. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1418.58s)]
*  Same what you believe isn't meddling. Yeah, this is a bunch of bullshit, right? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1423.78s)]
*  This is a bunch of like people hiding behind norms that nobody abides by, right? And the reality is [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1427.3s)]
*  if we are going to give four billion dollars a year, like we should be able to have a point of view. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1435.06s)]
*  And I would say that if you truly care about Israel, you know, which I do, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1439.46s)]
*  you know, the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1445.06s)]
*  members of Congress [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1446.82s)]
*  who are usually defending, you know, Israel talk about how it's so important to defend this democracy in the Middle East and all this stuff. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1448.5s)]
*  Well, if you care about Israel and its democracy, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1454.58s)]
*  how can you look in the mirror? Yeah, how can you look in the mirror and do nothing to defend that democracy? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1457.8600000000001s)]
*  These people on the streets in Israel are doing a hell of a lot more to stand up for Israeli democracy [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1462.9s)]
*  than American politicians who mouth platitudes about Israeli democracy while doing nothing [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1468.26s)]
*  while those people are getting like water cannon, you know? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1472.98s)]
*  So I would argue that the pro-Israel, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1475.38s)]
*  pro-Israeli democracy position would be to try to do more to help these people in Israel who are trying to stand up for democratic values [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1477.8400000000001s)]
*  because there's no reason that this like extremist far-right government [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1485.14s)]
*  is permanent, right? We should want that not to become the permanent character of the Israeli state, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1489.3s)]
*  not just for our own sake, but for the sake of Israel democracy and all the people that are in the streets trying to defend it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1495.38s)]
*  Absolutely. Well, I'm sure we'll be covering this [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1500.58s)]
*  repeatedly over the next few weeks. But speaking of the fate of democracy, Ben, let's turn to Spain where they just had an election on Sunday. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1502.96s)]
*  Many people going into this election were afraid that Spain's center-right party would win the most seats [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1510.34s)]
*  in the election, but not win enough to form a government and that they would end up forming a coalition with the far-right [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1516.5s)]
*  nationalist Vox party. Now Vox isn't Ezra Klein and Matt Iglesias. Vox is this terrible... Max Fisher, by the way, didn't he start Vox? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1521.78s)]
*  Terrible anti-immigrant. We should give him shit about that. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1530.4199999999998s)]
*  Why didn't you found a far-right Spanish political party? I didn't know you'd been to Spain. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1533.78s)]
*  Yeah, but Vox is like anti-immigrant, they're anti-LGBT rights, they're hostile to the EU, and like Spain has a [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1537.46s)]
*  very scary, very recent [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1543.78s)]
*  history with right-wing fascism under Franco. So this is like you want to mess around with these kind of parties. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1545.78s)]
*  The good news is that didn't happen. Vox actually lost seats. So now the center-right PP party, which is funny to say, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1551.38s)]
*  and the current prime minister... [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1559.3s)]
*  And the current prime minister and the center-left socialist party, they're both going to try to cut deals with smaller regional parties to cobble together [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1562.34s)]
*  176 seats to have a majority in the legislature to run the government. So [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1568.08s)]
*  Ben, how you feeling about this outcome? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1573.38s)]
*  The question I have is whether [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1575.94s)]
*  Vox's stumbles had to do with [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1578.18s)]
*  issues specific to Spain, in particular the prime minister's pretty like deft handling of [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1580.9s)]
*  Catalan independence and kind of defusing that issue, which a lot of people think led to Vox's rise, versus a broader trend [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1585.86s)]
*  and maybe struggles for these far-right parties. That's me wish casting. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1592.66s)]
*  No, I think the wish casting is [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1596.42s)]
*  true to a point because you know what we've seen is that in a lot of these countries [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1598.42s)]
*  there's kind of like a ceiling on these particularly odious far-right parties, right? Like so the AFD, the Nazis in Germany, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1602.74s)]
*  like they kind of top out about 10 percent, you know, Vox is kind of topping out around 15. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1610.66s)]
*  The the the uber right-wing party in the Netherlands, usually tops out around 10 to 15 percent. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1616.18s)]
*  And you know, Marine Le Pen has gotten a little more than that, but like she's tried to moderate, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1622.58s)]
*  she tried to play the same game that you know, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1627.46s)]
*  we've seen in Italy, but like that still hasn't allowed her to get over the threshold of winning an election. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1629.62s)]
*  So I think there is something to the reality that, you know, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1634.98s)]
*  there's a difference between kind of center-right, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1638.3400000000001s)]
*  nationalist sentiments and anti-immigrant politics that have allowed kind of certain right-wing leaders to come to power in parts of Europe. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1641.3s)]
*  You know, particularly in central and eastern Europe, a little bit more right-wing, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1648.98s)]
*  but in some of these western European countries, there's kind of a ceiling on the far-right. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1653.06s)]
*  You know, among the uncertainty is, you know, Spain is one of the countries that has the rotating presidency of the EU right now, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1656.18s)]
*  so you'd like to have a little bit more stability there, but a good result in seeing Vox fall this short. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1661.3s)]
*  Yes, here's our weirdest story of the day, I think. So last week, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1666.58s)]
*  a U.S. soldier on a tour of the demilitarized zone, or the DMZ, the area between North and South Korea, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1670.82s)]
*  decided to leave a tour and sprint across the border and into North Korea in custody. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1677.28s)]
*  So this guy's name was Private Travis T. King. His motives aren't clear yet. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1682.42s)]
*  We know that he's a 23 year old private second class. He's been in the army since 2021, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1686.42s)]
*  serving as a cavalry scout at the base in South Korea near the DMZ. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1690.82s)]
*  He had recently spent 47 days in a South Korean jail for beating someone up at a club in Seoul [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1694.8200000000002s)]
*  last September, I believe, and then I think he kicked the car, the cop car that came, like broke the cop car. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1700.02s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like a real class act. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1705.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, he got in some real trouble. So this guy was in South Korean detention for a while. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1706.3400000000001s)]
*  He got out on July 10th, then he spent a week sort of under observation at a U.S. military base. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1710.26s)]
*  He was supposed to return to the U.S. on July 17th, where he likely would have been disciplined further or kicked out of the army. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1714.98s)]
*  U.S. officials escorted him to the airport, but not to his gate because they didn't have tickets. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1721.78s)]
*  And so instead of flying back to Texas, King left the airport, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1726.98s)]
*  spent 12 hours finding his way to a tour of the DMZ and then fled to North Korea. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1730.58s)]
*  The North Koreans haven't said anything publicly about what happened. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1736.82s)]
*  The U.S. government says they've reached out to North Korean officials via the UN, but haven't heard back. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1740.4199999999998s)]
*  I think people are wondering, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1745.1399999999999s)]
*  is this a guy going through like a mental health crisis? Is this a defection? Is this someone like coordinating with [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1746.82s)]
*  North Korean intelligence and been working on this for a while? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1753.6200000000001s)]
*  Apparently there was a van waiting for him on the North Korean side of the border, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1756.34s)]
*  which suggests there was some degree of planning, but who knows? Maybe that van is always there. Like, what do I know? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1760.1s)]
*  So Ben, if King [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1765.06s)]
*  defected or I guess regardless, I'm sure the North Koreans will get some like limited intelligence out of him, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1767.46s)]
*  but probably hopefully nothing too sensitive, although the discord leaks [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1772.9s)]
*  taught us that anything can happen. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1777.3000000000002s)]
*  But the Wall Street Journal had a great piece on sort of the history of these incidents. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1778.8200000000002s)]
*  At least six U.S. military service members have defected to North Korea over the past several decades. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1782.98s)]
*  Army Sergeant Charles Jenkins defected in 1965 and was used in propaganda for nearly 40 years before finally getting to Japan and returning. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1787.46s)]
*  American defectors are apparently [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1796.42s)]
*  cast as evil American soldiers in these North Korean like agitprop films about the war. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1798.4199999999998s)]
*  The scarier example is, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1805.62s)]
*  yeah, you become like a movie star. You become a movie star in the worst way possible. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1808.34s)]
*  You're evil again. You don't really get to, you know, extend yourself or learn your craft. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1812.74s)]
*  Yeah, the scarier example is Otto Warmbier, who was an American student arrested in North Korea when he I think ripped down a political poster. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1817.62s)]
*  He was then beaten and and or denied medical care that led to brain damage and his death in 2017. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1825.5400000000002s)]
*  So Ben, this is a huge mess and it doesn't sound like one that will be resolved anytime soon. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1831.94s)]
*  But I don't know if you have thoughts. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1838.74s)]
*  Well, we don't know. Yeah, like you said, I mean, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1840.98s)]
*  it's hard to judge when you don't know whether this person had like a real mental health issue or whether they just had a, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1843.6200000000001s)]
*  you know, nefarious intention to defect and potentially share information with North Korea. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1851.54s)]
*  Either way, like I guess the observations I'd make are first of all, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1857.46s)]
*  never a good bet to think that it's going to turn out better for you in North Korea. You know, like just like uniformly across the board, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1862.42s)]
*  whatever this guy thought he was looking at back home [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1869.46s)]
*  or whatever he didn't like about [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1872.42s)]
*  the U.S. or South Korea, like [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1874.42s)]
*  he's not going to find anything better over there, you know, and so and I don't mean that in any [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1876.9s)]
*  humorous way, like it's [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1880.98s)]
*  tragedy for whatever informed his judgment. It's not going to turn out well. I think the other point [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1883.14s)]
*  that, you know, we've talked to, you know, oftentimes there's, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1889.06s)]
*  you know, be careful here, but like there's a huge umbrella put over anybody that is detained [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1893.38s)]
*  in foreign countries as, you know, they're all hostages and [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1898.66s)]
*  but like there's [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1902.9s)]
*  differences here, you know, like we've talked about the differences between like a [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1904.26s)]
*  journalist who's detained like Evan Gershkovitz and yeah in in Russia or Jim Foley in [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1908.6399999999999s)]
*  Syria, even like a journalist even trying to cover like a tough spot or Laura Ling who was taken hostage by the North Koreans in [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1914.98s)]
*  when was that 2008 2009 she gets out and then there's like people that maybe let's just say exercise some poor judgment, right? Like [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1921.86s)]
*  the hikers, you know that we [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1930.1799999999998s)]
*  dealt with and which I'm not trying to attack them or anything, but these guys actually hiked into Iran [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1932.4199999999998s)]
*  These guys accidentally hiked in Iran and that like, you know that that's a weird place to go hiking, you know [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1936.02s)]
*  But i'm glad they got home and it was important and it was important to try to get them home [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1940.5s)]
*  but like and then this is you know the far end of the other spectrum, which is that this person [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1944.1s)]
*  chose to do this for whatever reason and so [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1949.1399999999999s)]
*  You know, obviously the u.s. Should be concerned about a safety should be trying to get them home [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1952.34s)]
*  but like I I just think it's a different category than [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1955.3s)]
*  Than people that are taken in other circumstances and and that informs how you approach it, you know [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1958.82s)]
*  Um [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1964.26s)]
*  like so I like I hope he's released on kind of humanitarian grounds, maybe the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1965.46s)]
*  North Koreans will come to realize that you know, he's not the next movie star for their [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1970.5800000000002s)]
*  Anti-american word flicks or whatever but like it seems like this person needs some help [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1975.2s)]
*  But don't do this like I I just remember when I was in government, you know, uh [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1981.0600000000002s)]
*  sometimes [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1986.5800000000002s)]
*  you would just think like [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1988.18s)]
*  You want to tell someone like don't take this risk or don't [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1989.86s)]
*  Do this thing and think that the u.s. Is automatically going to be able to bring you home, you know [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1993.4599999999998s)]
*  Because that's not always the case the issue of the capacity [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=1998.34s)]
*  I mean like in the case of laura ling who we mentioned earlier [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2000.74s)]
*  I mean the president obama had to send bill clinton, which was a big get for kim jung-il at the time [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2003.86s)]
*  Yeah, those propaganda photos are still surfacing and they're they're not funny [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2009.62s)]
*  But it's like you can tell in the photos that everyone in the clinton entourage was told wear a black suit [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2013.1399999999999s)]
*  Like you're going to a funeral and do not smile. Yeah, none of them are smiling. Um, yeah ben [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2018.4199999999998s)]
*  I think this I just worry this guy's gonna be held for a very long time [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2022.98s)]
*  It reminds me of the bo bark doll case who is you know, he walked out who was also a guy with some problems [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2025.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it was helped for five years [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2029.86s)]
*  Um, uh, as long as we're talking about north korea. I did just want to shout out two stories worth reading [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2031.9399999999998s)]
*  The first is a washington post story about yomi park a north korean defector who has become [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2036.4199999999998s)]
*  A darling of the right-wing media circuit [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2043.1399999999999s)]
*  For example ben [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2045.62s)]
*  I was trying to make sure I was pronouncing her name correctly and I youtube it and I found her [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2046.5s)]
*  Conversation at the ein rane institute. So there you go [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2050.64s)]
*  Um, but she likes to claim paul ryan. Yeah, me and paul ryan were there [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2054.1s)]
*  She likes to claim that evil woke people are going to turn the u.s into north korea basically in the actual she's like [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2056.98s)]
*  very interesting story actually i've read about this too like [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2062.9s)]
*  like [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2066.58s)]
*  There's such a splintering of media that I sometimes are these people that are like very famous and right-wing media [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2067.3s)]
*  And and I've never heard of them and like I like discovered her and didn't realize she was like this phenomenon [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2072.5s)]
*  You know I didn't either and she became famous first in south korea where she sort of was on this reality show and told her [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2077.3s)]
*  Story, but north korean scholars have have questioned a lot of her assertions [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2082.98s)]
*  Uh and have noticed that her story has changed a lot since the audience became the united states [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2087.94s)]
*  And her right-wing influencers here versus south korea kind of happened with the chinese, uh dissident. Yes. Yes, sure did [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2095.22s)]
*  um later, uh, yeah, and also, uh, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2102.2599999999998s)]
*  There's an amazing story the bbc somehow managed to communicate with three north koreans living in the country over the course of several months [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2104.5s)]
*  to learn about what life has been like there since [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2111.14s)]
*  Uh, they closed the border in 2020 because of covid and it's just unimaginably awful [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2113.54s)]
*  And I just think it's great reporting one by bbc and worth reading to remember like the character of the guy [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2118.5s)]
*  That trump is constantly praising on truth social or whatever. That's true. I mean north korea can be this kind of cartoon [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2124.34s)]
*  Character right is kim yong-un and then there's like, you know crazy propaganda videos. I mean if i've spent you know, 30 minutes watching [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2130.8199999999997s)]
*  Oh me too newscasters like, you know moaning about kim yong-un. Well, it's cuz danny russell said yeah [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2138.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. But underneath that right there are people millions of people living basically in hell on earth, right like [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2143.06s)]
*  no freedoms, uh deeply impoverished [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2150.2599999999998s)]
*  malnutrition [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2153.7599999999998s)]
*  um not even necessarily like the the most chilling stuff i've ever read about is people like [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2154.8199999999997s)]
*  Aren't even aware, you know of like a an alternative world or history [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2160.02s)]
*  And the only economy was like the black market smuggling economy when they shut the border that went away [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2164.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, people just literally had nothing. Yeah, so keep that in mind next time you hear about you know, trump talking about what good buddies [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2168.8199999999997s)]
*  He is with this guy. Yeah, speaking of trump's buddies. So [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2173.94s)]
*  You are going to talk a lot more about russia and ukraine in the interview with samantha power [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2177.06s)]
*  But we did want to uh do some quick updates [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2181.94s)]
*  So the first is that russian security services arrested this far-right ultra nationalist former fsb intelligence officer turned telegram star [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2184.58s)]
*  Telegram commendator named igor gurkin [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2194.2599999999998s)]
*  Back in 2014 gurkin helped lead russia's invasion of krymia and he worked as a commander of separatist forces in the eastern ukraine and donbass region [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2197.2999999999997s)]
*  A dutch court convicted him of facilitating the transfer of russian surface-to-air missiles from russia to ukraine that were used to shoot down [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2205.2999999999997s)]
*  Malaysian flight 17 so he's a very bad guy. He is one of those [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2212.02s)]
*  Super nationalist right-wing bloggers that we've talked about a lot of times on the show [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2216.66s)]
*  Who have been allowed to criticize the military from the right for being incompetent for not being harsh enough. They're like nukem, whatever [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2220.26s)]
*  But he appears to have lost his fucking mind [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2227.86s)]
*  After the prugosian mutiny and started criticizing putin himself in harsh ways. So ben this is from the financial times [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2230.7400000000002s)]
*  Gurken on his blog has called prugosian a traitor and ridiculed putin's decision to meet with him in other waggoner commanders just days after the mutiny [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2238.2599999999998s)]
*  Suggesting it was a sign of weakness on the president's part [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2244.82s)]
*  This is a quote from gurkin wretched whining complaints about partners for a very very long time [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2247.38s)]
*  The president's rhetoric does not even remotely resemble traditional male standard [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2252.02s)]
*  The country will not survive another six years with his cowardly mediocrity in power [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2256.1s)]
*  And the only useful thing he could do before the end is to ensure the transfer of power to someone truly capable and [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2260.42s)]
*  Responsible so that'll get you killed. Uh [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2266.96s)]
*  Not a deal. It's a lot of like kind of toxic mess you're only swirling around these guys like gurken putin or the prugosian but like I um [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2270.5s)]
*  I think this is important. Uh, I did too first of all [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2277.94s)]
*  This is like a an important guy, right? Like I knew about this guy back in 2014 15 [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2281.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean he was one of the people that was kind of fomenting this petempkin, you know separatists in eastern ukraine rising up [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2287.14s)]
*  I mean he was like a commander. He was like a real figure. He wasn't just like a guy with a blog on television [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2294.1s)]
*  He's like tucker carlson [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2298.74s)]
*  Leading tucker carlson had a militia and like the don boss, right? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2300.2599999999998s)]
*  Which maybe in arizona actually that may happen. That may be the next the next is x tv show media company, right? Yeah [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2304.18s)]
*  So this is not like just some guy with a blog. This is a guy with like a you know history [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2311.7s)]
*  Um, but to me the important point is that like putin is now looking over all he's looking over his shoulder at the liberals [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2315.78s)]
*  He's looking over his shoulder now at the right wing guys who are starting to criticize his [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2322.58s)]
*  His manhood and his capacity to rule he's looking over at, you know prugosian and belarus like this is not [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2327.22s)]
*  Going well for him. There's there's starting to be a multiplicity of [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2333.86s)]
*  people that don't want to see putin in charge of russia such that he's putting all these different people in jail, you know and [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2337.46s)]
*  Post prugosian [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2345.94s)]
*  The idea that somehow putin, you know was just a strong like no this is this is a guy who's worried, right? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2347.54s)]
*  Like you don't throw people in jail for things on telegram [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2352.58s)]
*  Unless you feel like there's a real threat emanating from that people that person right? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2356.58s)]
*  And so to me i'd watch this space like of of like is putin's now cracking down on the far right [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2360.42s)]
*  Just like he had to crack down on liberals and and and that that's a guy who's getting weaker [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2366.74s)]
*  He's on a he's basically on like an island that is shrinking, you know [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2370.9s)]
*  And that's never a place you want to be in a totalitarian system [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2374.5s)]
*  He's also doing this at a time when they're increasing conscription [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2377.94s)]
*  So they raise the age of who can be drafted into the military for a mandatory one year of service from age [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2381.14s)]
*  18 to 27 to age 18 to 30 [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2387.14s)]
*  Uh the law this new law also forbids men from leaving russia on the day. They were called the conscription office [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2389.94s)]
*  They're trying to get after the draft dodgers and they also made a change so that [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2395.38s)]
*  Senior officers as old as 70 could be called back into service. It used to be 65 [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2399.38s)]
*  Jesus christ, what's going on? I missed that. Um that piece of it. Uh, yeah, I mean look that will make [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2404.1s)]
*  More people unhappy right like that will I mean look that that may [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2411.3s)]
*  Frankly in the very short term help them throw some more bodies at the front line [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2415.54s)]
*  So i'm sure you know, it's not good for ukraine to be dealing with this kind of larger well of conscripts coming from russia [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2419.62s)]
*  But I think over time it erodes pudin's position because it's more people are unhappy. It's more households that are [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2426.5s)]
*  Losing somebody it's more of the economy that's taking a hit [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2432.98s)]
*  I'm sure more people will emigrate and try to get out of russia because of this even though they're being told they can't [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2435.94s)]
*  They'll still find a way. So, you know again, none of this suggests a guy [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2440.98s)]
*  That is really confident in his position either militarily in ukraine or politically in russia [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2445.78s)]
*  Also, it's just worth pointing out that ukraine, uh, the ukrainians [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2451.54s)]
*  Reportedly launched another drone attack on moscow and on kremia [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2455.22s)]
*  And the russians are are harassing us drones over syria. So on july 23rd [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2458.74s)]
*  There's now video out of this all over twitter a russian fighter jet launched flares at an american reaper drone that I think was doing [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2464.02s)]
*  Counter-isis work in the syria region the flares hit the propeller damaged the thing and I raise this because like [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2470.7999999999997s)]
*  You and I were in a couple meetings back in the day [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2479.54s)]
*  When folks at the pentagon recommended incredibly hawkish kind of scary intense responses [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2482.7400000000002s)]
*  When I think it was the iranians were messing with an american drone [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2488.5s)]
*  I can only imagine what the conversations about actually damaging this thing are like right now [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2491.0600000000004s)]
*  I just think again it speaks to like these multiple escalation risks the ukrainians [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2495.38s)]
*  As we've talked about going to continue to try to strike into russia continue to try to strike deep into kremia [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2500.9s)]
*  I'm sure they want to blow up that bridge connecting kremia to russia [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2506.34s)]
*  The russians are like fucking around in syria where we obviously have a lot of military [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2509.54s)]
*  Assets including some some troops on the ground like there's just just like the more this war goes on [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2514.74s)]
*  instability in russia [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2520.16s)]
*  And flashpoints in these different places, you know are going to be increasingly [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2521.86s)]
*  Coming to the forefront for sure. Uh, so last week [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2526.82s)]
*  We talked about some of the republican 2024 candidates and their views on ukraine [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2529.14s)]
*  We didn't spend a lot of time on ron de santis [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2532.82s)]
*  But lucky for us as part of his slow rolling [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2534.98s)]
*  Disaster that they're calling a campaign reset. Let ron be ron [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2538.1800000000003s)]
*  He's doing more interviews. So here's a clip of jake tapper talking with the santis about his claim that wokeness is harming military recruiting [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2542.02s)]
*  The army did this survey. I'll give you a copy of it if you want [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2548.9s)]
*  They haven't released it but I got my hands on a copy [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2552.34s)]
*  And it looked at it surveyed people I think 16 to 28 barriers to service and beyond the ones such as don't want to die [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2554.98s)]
*  Don't want to be injured don't want to be away from my family [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2561.3s)]
*  The biggest issues [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2563.78s)]
*  Were the number two issue women and racial or ethnic minorities are discriminated against in the army wokeness is listed here [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2565.3s)]
*  But it's only it's only number nine [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2571.2200000000003s)]
*  So that would suggest that wokeness is not as big [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2574.34s)]
*  Well, but I think there's an issue about like not even really knows what wokeness is [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2576.9s)]
*  I mean i've defined it but a lot of people who rail against wokeness can't even define it [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2580.5s)]
*  And so I think it's a sense of you know [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2584.9s)]
*  This is not something that's that's holding true to the core martial values that make the military unique [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2586.82s)]
*  His voice is so I I just I was like like just hard to react to anything you just start to hear his voice and you [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2592.66s)]
*  kind of [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2598.02s)]
*  You kind of want to punch his voice. Yeah [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2599.3s)]
*  Like not him himself like so it should be clear [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2602.58s)]
*  but like the voice is just like it sounds like the voice of a man who changes the curriculum to to celebrate the [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2605.14s)]
*  the work [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2611.7s)]
*  Created by slavery, you know, like this just sounds like a smarmy prick in the world [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2612.74s)]
*  What a shocker that racism and sexism are far more of an issue [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2617.8599999999997s)]
*  By the way, joe biden recently selected admiral lisa franchetti to lead the u.s [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2620.8199999999997s)]
*  Navy if confirmed she would be the first woman to be a service chief and the first female member of the joint chiefs [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2625.22s)]
*  Of staff but her nomination was immediately blocked by our favorite alabama senator tommy toberville [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2630.3399999999997s)]
*  Who is mad that the u.s military supporting members? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2636.18s)]
*  Of the military who need abortion services, but yeah, man, uh, wokeness is your issue [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2639.14s)]
*  I mean, this is going to drive away. I think more potential female recruits than anything else ronda santas talking about [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2643.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it the military like [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2650.18s)]
*  their their [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2655.06s)]
*  insistence on imposing their culture war on the military is both completely [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2656.8s)]
*  Divorced from the reality of actually being in the military like the like jake points out like nobody's actually that worried about this there [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2662.1s)]
*  But it's also it is going to muck around with recruiting on all men or fronts, right? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2668.42s)]
*  You and I have been going back and forth on the one hand [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2673.06s)]
*  I think they're going to be these like proud boys who don't want to join the military anymore because they're [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2675.3s)]
*  In that small number of people who are concerned about like woke issues on the other end. There are women who are like, uh, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2679.94s)]

*  Like he has no respect and no regard for veterans [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2770.58s)]
*  um [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2773.22s)]
*  I I don't we should ask gibbs like [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2774.8199999999997s)]
*  He was coach at auburn for a long time. Yeah, he's pretty good coach [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2777.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he reminds me of the racist coach in varsity blues. Well, that's what i'm saying [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2780.4199999999996s)]
*  Like like he's clearly was coaching like a multi-racial like the yeah, he's definitely like the figure of the racist [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2783.14s)]
*  Football coach like give me a break go back to alabama. Absolutely sucks a couple more shorter things [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2789.22s)]
*  So then uh apple the company they say a planned that plan changes to surveillance laws in britain could force them to withdraw security features [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2793.9399999999996s)]
*  And ultimately make i-message and facetime unavailable in the uk. So that issue is a law called the investigatory powers act of 2016 [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2801.3799999999997s)]
*  Which apple says requires them to notify the uk home office when it updates its products including ios software updates [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2809.8599999999997s)]
*  Apple is concerned about an amendment that would allow the government to block implementation of security features while the home office are reviewing them [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2816.1s)]
*  Which apple says gives the home office de facto control over security and encryption updates globally. So here's a quote from apple [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2822.82s)]
*  These provisions could be used to force a company like apple that could never build a back door [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2830.7400000000002s)]
*  To publicly withdraw critical security features from the uk market depriving the uk users of these protections and quote result in an impossible choice [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2834.18s)]
*  Between complying with the home office mandate to secretly install vulnerabilities into new security technologies [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2842.2599999999998s)]
*  Which apple would never do or to forego development of those technologies altogether and sit on the sidelines as threats to user data [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2847.8599999999997s)]
*  Security continue to grow end quote. So ben, I just want to say to all of our listeners out there labor tori anybody [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2854.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh, don't let your government go down this road like obama was wrong about this [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2860.5s)]
*  We all deserve to communicate privately do not let vague threats or suggestions of terrorism scare you like there's better ways to catch [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2865.06s)]
*  Child predators and terrorists and installing a back door into fucking iMessage [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2871.86s)]
*  Yeah, I I totally agree with that and uh, including like, you know when this fight happened the obama years, not only was it wrong [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2876.42s)]
*  But man like tim cook and apple [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2884.1s)]
*  Love this fight. Oh, then they're tough. Like they they love they have every incentive to stand up and be seen to be [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2888.2599999999998s)]
*  Taking a stand for consumer privacy [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2894.98s)]
*  Against the snoops in government, so you're going to lose in the court of public opinion, too [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2897.8599999999997s)]
*  And so this is just not a close call like I you know [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2904.3399999999997s)]
*  The idea that they have to you know [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2906.98s)]
*  Before I get my like automated notice of like an upgrade in the security on my iphone like that [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2908.98s)]
*  They're gonna like brief the home office like no like give me a break some goober working on the home office [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2914.3399999999997s)]
*  Ben we talked about this last week, but the chinese foreign minister is still missing [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2919.2999999999997s)]
*  We talked about a strange absence in more detail last week including speculation that he'd had an affair with a tv personality [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2922.58s)]
*  And maybe got in trouble [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2928.2599999999998s)]
*  But um now it looks like there might be a meeting by the chinese communist party sort of officials in charge of replacing him [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2929.62s)]
*  So this seems to be getting even more ominous the foreign minister. Yeah, he's he's replaced now actually [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2936.5s)]
*  Oh, he's fully on. Okay. So just breaking news, uh shortly before this podcast [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2941.94s)]
*  They put wang yi who was the foreign minister from like, you know for over a decade back into the obama years [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2946.58s)]
*  back in his old post as foreign minister, um [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2952.66s)]
*  so [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2956.1s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2957.46s)]
*  Like everything about this is insane [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2958.5s)]
*  Like we still don't know what happened to this guy like and I hope that just because they he's been replaced and like [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2959.94s)]
*  People don't like look away from this because it's this guy that had this like meteoric rise to become foreign minister [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2964.8199999999997s)]
*  He's been disappeared for over a month [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2970.74s)]
*  They've never provided an explanation that vacuum has been filled with all these kind of lurid rumors that he's having like an affair [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2972.74s)]
*  with like a tv personality in the u.s, but like [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2979.54s)]
*  Meanwhile chinese diplomacy like nobody knows who to call like it's a real weakness in their system [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2983.22s)]
*  but the only other thing i'd highlight that's different from what we discussed last week, too, is that [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2988.74s)]
*  This guy was like very close to xi Jinping. He was seen as like a protege of xi Jinping [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2993.06s)]
*  he got ahead by essentially being the model of what xi Jinping wanted which is this kind of combination of like a [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=2998.18s)]
*  wolf warrior and a [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3004.34s)]
*  Xi Jinping disciple there's some great details in some of the stories about he had a job for a while as like the protocol guy [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3005.86s)]
*  So like imagine like that's how he got ahead because he would plan [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3012.1s)]
*  Xi Jinping's trips and he'd get up in the middle of the night and do these walkthroughs of you know [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3015.06s)]
*  He needed to know exactly where xi Jinping was going to step at this time or another and so [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3019.2999999999997s)]
*  This inevitably like makes xi look bad. I think um because it's totally opaque and his guy just like his head rolled [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3023.8599999999997s)]
*  So but I you know, let's see where this guy is like i'm really curious about it. Yeah, I want to find that too [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3031.46s)]
*  um last couple things so [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3037.2999999999997s)]
*  Saudi arabia continues to buy its way to sports dominance or at least try so the latest news is al-halal [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3039.6200000000003s)]
*  It's a saudi club owned by saudi arabia sovereign wealth fund a soccer team [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3046.7400000000002s)]
*  Reportedly offered a package valued at 1.1 [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3051.46s)]
*  Billion dollars to get a player named kilian imbapé onto their club for just one season [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3055.1400000000003s)]
*  One season 1.1 billion dollars. So imbapé. He's unbelievable. He's a french forward [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3062.1800000000003s)]
*  He currently plays on the qatar. He owned paris st germain, uh, or psg [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3067.62s)]
*  Uh, so the way this deal works is three hundred and thirty two million dollars would go to psg [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3073.06s)]
*  That's like the transfer fee and then seven hundred and seventy six million would go to imbapé in the form of salary [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3077.86s)]
*  And I think some sponsorship stuff that means he would be making over [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3083.54s)]
*  Two million dollars a day and it would be so, uh mbs [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3087.86s)]
*  You win we give up [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3092.74s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you can become like a billionaire [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3094.8199999999997s)]
*  By playing one season of soccer, you know, and this guy is really good. But like, you know, what's scary about this is [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3097.7799999999997s)]
*  We've said this time and again like mbs wants to show us [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3104.74s)]
*  Us being everybody else in the world that he can buy whatever he wants [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3109.54s)]
*  We're all for sale and upstate to qataris. It's like he's gonna come here and be like [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3112.9799999999996s)]
*  He'd give us two billion dollars to potty the world and react now. We'd probably get [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3116.4199999999996s)]
*  You know, uh chopped up chopped up over there [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3120.2599999999998s)]
*  But the point is like and even some us athletes I saw like we're saying like oh shit [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3122.82s)]
*  This sounds good. Like that's what he wants. He wants oh all these nba players were like replying [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3127.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and like which is fine that like i'm not gonna hold against them, but that's the point he wants it to be known [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3132.6600000000003s)]
*  Like this is what i've always said about mbs. It's not that he wants you to not think he's just buying the stuff [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3139.3s)]
*  No, he wants you to believe [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3144.02s)]
*  That he's going to show that everything is ultimately for sale, you know [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3146.34s)]
*  And if he can buy the best soccer playing the world even for just a year [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3150.18s)]
*  A billion dollars is nothing to this guy. It's absolutely nothing and that's kind of his message [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3154.02s)]
*  He could he could start a basketball league next year, you know [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3158.2599999999998s)]
*  And buy where the fuck he wants for that too. Like that's what he wants us all to be aware of so it's depressing [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3161.54s)]
*  Yeah, because that's the message just like he bought professional golf [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3166.98s)]
*  And he already bought and he got christiano ronaldo to come over and lionel messi is their sort of like pr ambassador [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3170.5s)]
*  But yeah, you know, uh, jeanus, uh [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3176.3399999999997s)]
*  Bunch of nba players were saying like I look like imbappe give me a billion dollars, right? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3179.3s)]
*  Like everyone just look I get it from a player perspective [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3183.62s)]
*  There's like get paid but like if i'm you know, not that they would or should have to think about this [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3185.7000000000003s)]
*  But them doing that is actually the point like like the reason mbs is doing this is not just to get imbappe [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3190.34s)]
*  It's to get those players saying that because it's like oh shit like that. Like like yeah, like at the end of the day [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3196.34s)]
*  The the force of gravity is to saudi no matter what mbs does. Yeah final story [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3202.58s)]
*  So, uh guy named robert maynard. He's the mayor of this small french town has instituted a policy where dogs [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3207.4599999999996s)]
*  That get walked on main streets have to file their dna with the local government [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3214.74s)]
*  And have to carry a passport to prove they've complied with this law the reason [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3221.2999999999997s)]

*  so [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3673.64s)]

*  But you know having it described how many jobs? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3739.72s)]

*  Downtown odessa not just the grain silos and and and the other port infrastructure [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3775.42s)]
*  but downtown odessa [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3781.1s)]
*  being part of this un [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3783.02s)]
*  brokered [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3785.64s)]
*  Enterprise had actually bought odessa a year-long reprieve [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3786.84s)]
*  From missile attacks. So now the question of ukrainian refugees, are they going to come home? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3791.82s)]
*  Are they not which zolensky is counting on in advance of the school year so that they can go back to work [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3797.1800000000003s)]
*  So that there can be more tax revenue so you see putin killing as it were, you know multiple birds with one stone. He's [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3801.98s)]
*  uh, you know really [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3809.5s)]
*  Having a terrible effect on global food prices. You see the food price is up 17 percent since he pulled out of the deal [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3811.98s)]
*  Uh, he is going to make it very hard for ukrainian farmers even with us aid support [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3819.02s)]
*  To make ends meet because the cost of exporting grain through other channels is so much greater [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3825.42s)]
*  Again, we've diversified those channels. We are going to get the grains out [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3831.26s)]
*  But it's much more expensive. So the the profit margin for your average farmer isn't great [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3835.18s)]
*  And then odessa this this this major town [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3841.26s)]
*  Um, you know now finds itself in the rifle sites and the missile sites and the drone sites [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3845.02s)]
*  Of russian forces for the first time [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3851.18s)]
*  In in a year and that's its own [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3854.54s)]
*  devastating stake that I think [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3858.12s)]
*  People were very focused on food prices globally maybe a little bit on the agricultural sector and the effects on the ukrainian economy [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3860.52s)]
*  But the idea that you now have a new civilian hub a cosmopolitan city may ben you go there you walk around [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3866.92s)]
*  You know right on the ocean cafes people out art galleries. I mean a very very [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3873.72s)]
*  um, uh, you know a kind of hub of culture and economic and and social life in ukraine and with such great history a [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3879.88s)]
*  unesco protected site [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3887.62s)]
*  now [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3889.7s)]
*  Uh being deemed by putin fair game, uh to to strike and the human cost of that, you know, you can't overstay [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3890.66s)]
*  And so what what were you doing on your trip? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3897.46s)]
*  Like tell us a little bit about like what you set out to do. I imagine you were trying to find alternative routes for some of this [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3900.1s)]
*  uh agricultural yield [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3906.58s)]
*  um, but what what was the uh, what was the nature of your visit? Well, I think that [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3908.66s)]
*  Um, but [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3913.54s)]
*  There's a lot of focus rightly on what the next weapon system is that the ukrainians need particularly as they [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3916.18s)]
*  You know slog ahead in this very very difficult counter offensive [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3923.3s)]
*  um, and you know what the ukrainians say is [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3927.94s)]
*  Defense and and weaponry is humanitarian support. So [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3932.74s)]
*  Um, you know, it's obviously a huge [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3937.46s)]
*  a hugely important part of what the united states is doing [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3940.42s)]
*  But as we've talked about a little bit in the past [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3943.54s)]
*  Just as important [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3946.66s)]
*  Is the other battlefront which is the battle to sustain and even grow ukraine's economy? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3948.42s)]
*  And as the war rages on to strengthen its democracy and the checks and balances [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3955.62s)]
*  And so I really wanted to get back there, uh to see how some of those investments are faring [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3961.06s)]
*  To hear from the ukrainians directly about what their priorities are as they potentially head into another winter [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3967.94s)]
*  uh, usa provided about 400 million dollars of uh support [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3974.1800000000003s)]
*  To ukraine as putin was weaponizing the cold and and trying to take out electricity and heat and and force the ukrainian [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3979.1400000000003s)]
*  Uh public undermine its morale and and try to force it to press solenski to to sue for peace [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3987.7000000000003s)]
*  We swept in swooped in there with our european and and other donor colleagues and supported their efforts [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3993.54s)]
*  You know when the pipes were hit to repair the pipes, you know within a day or two [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=3999.86s)]
*  To provide power stations and substations [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4003.7000000000003s)]
*  Now we're looking at you know, how do you protect? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4007.06s)]
*  Some of that infrastructure now that we have lead time. We know what gluten's going to do in the winter [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4009.86s)]
*  So a focus on energy with enough lead time to be able to make a difference [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4015.7000000000003s)]
*  A focus as you rightly said on the agricultural sector we usa had already [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4020.1800000000003s)]
*  Uh launched an initiative [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4025.3s)]
*  Going on a year ago now called agri ukraine [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4027.46s)]
*  Which was meant to expand ukraine's storage capacity for its bountiful grains [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4030.42s)]
*  Provide fertilizer and seeds to the farmers help develop [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4036.02s)]
*  These alternative routes which involves dredging the rivers, you know expanding lift capacity changing the gauges [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4040.7400000000002s)]
*  On ukrainian trains so that they are harmonized with those uh in europe [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4048.66s)]
*  Um, you know even you know [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4053.54s)]
*  Creating speedier passage at road transit points. We've gone from two days now to two two hours for commercial traffic to pass [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4056.34s)]
*  With usaid and and other donor support. So [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4065.46s)]
*  You know all of this work was important, but you know, this is still the lifeblood of of ukraine's economy [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4068.74s)]
*  The flag i'm not even sure if that many listeners know that the yellow [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4076.3399999999997s)]
*  In the ukrainian flag that is now so such a hallmark of the flags that still wave across the united states that yellow is wheat [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4080.3399999999997s)]
*  Fields and the blue is the ukrainian sky [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4086.8199999999997s)]
*  So I announced on the trip an additional 250 million dollar investment to do more [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4090.3399999999997s)]
*  In each of those areas that I just mentioned [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4095.54s)]
*  And we've already increased the grain [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4099.0599999999995s)]
*  throughput or export [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4103.04s)]
*  Movement by about four thousand percent [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4105.86s)]
*  via river [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4109.54s)]
*  Which is incredible. Um [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4110.9s)]
*  but if the black sea ports are now out of commission for the foreseeable future [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4113.139999999999s)]
*  we I talked to ukrainian officials about how we [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4118.9s)]
*  Capture that next million metric tons. Let's say monthly. I mean our goal collectively is to still be getting out [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4122.26s)]
*  five five and a half million metric tons [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4128.98s)]
*  Of agricultural commodities each month and if the black sea ports are out of the picture now [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4132.18s)]
*  We'll be at around three million a little shy of three million. So we have a long way to go [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4138.58s)]
*  And one more true question. I just because I was just concerned as your friend [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4142.74s)]
*  Because I saw you were in odessa and I saw there were these strikes in odessa [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4147.06s)]
*  I mean were any of the places that you visited? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4150.42s)]
*  Targets of those strikes. Well as it happens Ben, thank you for asking [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4153.22s)]
*  No, we felt so grateful to the you know, you know what it's like when the u.s. Government [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4157.46s)]
*  kicks in [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4162.42s)]
*  You know and and and offers such incredible intelligence support and security support [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4164.0199999999995s)]
*  so we we felt [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4169.54s)]
*  You know certainly as if we were in in very good hands and as we were traveling to odessa [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4171.54s)]
*  uh, the russians launched [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4178.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think something like 35 drone drone separate drone attacks [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4181.0599999999995s)]
*  Or 35 drones that attacked uh the port area [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4186.1s)]
*  Uh as well as I guess there were some cruise missile attacks [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4190.74s)]
*  We were able to proceed [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4194.74s)]
*  So far the russians have mainly attacked in the middle of the night and it has allowed a certain [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4196.820000000001s)]
*  kind of functionality because they're trying to to I mean they're certainly striking in the day in different parts of the country, but [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4202.18s)]
*  But there was a view that we could proceed and proceed safely as we did [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4208.9800000000005s)]
*  We held meetings with farmers to kind of hear what are the challenges in getting your goods to market [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4212.58s)]
*  Because it has to be said the black sea grain initiative as well. Like russia's been slow walking it [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4218.18s)]
*  Um, not allowing ships in for inspections, you know really reducing [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4223.46s)]
*  The throughput compared to what it was doing at its peak a couple months after it came into force [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4228.1s)]
*  So hearing from farmers about that about land mines, you know, how do they? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4234.02s)]
*  Uh till their fields when there's unexploded ordnances the cacova dam explosion that destroyed a bunch of arable land [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4237.860000000001s)]
*  So really hearing about those struggles. We did it in the port authority building. Um, and we also met with [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4245.62s)]
*  Deputy prime minister kubrkov and and the agricultural minister and others to talk about our next steps about what more we could do [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4251.7s)]
*  And then eventually at the end of a very long day in odessa. We got back on the train as we were on the train heading to keve [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4258.26s)]
*  Uh more strikes occurred including on the green infrastructure right next to where we were and in fact the very [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4264.900000000001s)]
*  Port authority building where we had held the meetings was badly damaged [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4270.900000000001s)]
*  In that second set of strikes, so i'm glad to be home. Um, i'm incredibly grateful to the people who um [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4275.54s)]
*  Supported us but above all mindful that that's ukrainian daily life. So it did bring home [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4282.58s)]
*  How volatile it is? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4289.38s)]
*  How no place is safe, I mean you're down there in the port [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4291.3s)]
*  Sun is shining. Uh, you see the cranes and the freights and all the capacity that is there [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4294.66s)]
*  Just wanting to feed the world. Um, and uh, and then a day later, you know much of that infrastructure has been [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4300.820000000001s)]
*  severely damaged [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4309.38s)]
*  Well, glad you're safe, but uh, that is a harrowing picture of what ukraines deal with so [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4311.46s)]
*  This is a country, uh that is literally fighting for its survival [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4316.9800000000005s)]
*  So much at stake [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4321.9400000000005s)]
*  Uh, we've been talking the podcast about some of the skeptics in this country who've called them to question continued u.s assistance [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4323.38s)]
*  um [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4331.06s)]
*  What how concerned are you about? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4332.34s)]
*  maintaining bipartisan support [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4335.2s)]
*  For the assistance that goes to ukraine [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4337.62s)]
*  Um, and and how do you answer? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4339.78s)]
*  If you have to uh, presumably you have to go to the hill sometimes [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4342.1s)]

*  I should I should stress that [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4384.259999999999s)]
*  USAID provides in addition to the kind of programming that you and I have talked about in the past and talked about today [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4386.98s)]

*  Dollars a month as we're down to about 1.2 billion a month [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4432.04s)]

*  There are a set of conditions that the imf has imposed that the european union has imposed because ukraine of course wants to get into the european union [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4473.16s)]
*  And we as well in our latest tranches of assistance are talking with them about the things that they need to do in order for this [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4481.08s)]
*  Assistance to keep flowing but our ultimate objective is to use our development assistance the kind of economic programming [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4486.52s)]

*  with regard to any piece of legislation is [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4612.599999999999s)]

*  Uh, you know, there's a lot of hijinks. I'm sure that that will will occur but in terms of broad [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4630.2s)]
*  Public opinion I would say that the the bipartisanship that has been the hallmark [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4637.32s)]
*  Of the united states the strength of the united states's response to russian aggression ukraine [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4643.24s)]
*  It has proven very resilient and appears to be enduring well, that's that's good news for now [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4648.84s)]
*  Um, so it's good to hear that one last question for you, which i'm more sympathetic to you [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4653.88s)]
*  Which is a tough question right you you're someone who I know cares about things beyond ukraine, right? [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4660.5199999999995s)]

*  Why are you guys so focused on this relative to sudan or relative to [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4676.280000000001s)]
*  any number of issues in the horn of africa, um, I know usaid has a lot of programs there, but obviously [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4681.96s)]
*  You know, you have to put a lot of weight bandwidth resources into ukraine. What do you say to people because I know you travel those places, too [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4688.52s)]
*  Uh, what do you say to people who who make the argument look? Okay, we get it ukraine's important, but [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4695.72s)]
*  What you know, why are you so focused on this relative to other things like how do you make a global argument? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4701.56s)]
*  to a skeptical audience [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4706.92s)]
*  that [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4709.16s)]
*  This isn't you know, uh out of proportion to other challenges in the world. Well, i'd say um [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4710.28s)]
*  A couple things. I mean first [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4717.8s)]
*  uh [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4719.88s)]
*  This kind of naked [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4721.64s)]
*  cross-border [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4724.68s)]
*  Aggression, you know actually in a pretty messed up global system is pretty rare [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4725.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we think about it. Um, and it's it does tap [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4730.76s)]
*  a kind of universal sense [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4736.6s)]
*  particularly among small countries that you know, you need to you need to live safe in your skin safe within your borders and [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4739.400000000001s)]
*  Other countries shouldn't be invading you and trying to lop off [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4747.160000000001s)]
*  You know in the case of ukraine the entire country or large large chunks of your country as a lot of a lot of countries [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4750.4400000000005s)]

*  and um [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4758.68s)]
*  And so I do think that there is something quite singular about the form of aggression that russia is taking i'm not saying [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4760.04s)]
*  What i'm saying is entirely persuasive to to those who who bring? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4767.0s)]
*  Understandably the question that you pose but I think it is part of the answer is that there that this is [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4772.34s)]
*  if if [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4778.44s)]
*  We are collectively to succeed [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4780.04s)]
*  On behalf of the principle of non-aggression and sovereignty [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4782.92s)]
*  This is a powerful signal as well, you know to aggressors [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4787.18s)]
*  To be honest ben your question [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4791.58s)]
*  Is actually less hard for me as us aid administrator to answer [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4794.46s)]
*  in july of 2023 than I might have feared when the full-scale invasion started because [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4799.42s)]
*  part of what the bipartisanship [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4806.7s)]
*  Has yielded [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4808.9400000000005s)]
*  Are not only significant. I mean I should say huge [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4810.46s)]
*  Supplementals that have enabled us to provide, you know the scale of assistance that we've been talking about in ukraine [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4813.98s)]
*  but those supplementals to the eternal credit of [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4820.38s)]
*  The republican and democratic leadership on the hill have been written broadly [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4824.38s)]
*  To give us scope to spend a very significant share of the quote new money [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4829.58s)]
*  On the global south so actually some of our flagship programs like feed the future which is you know [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4836.219999999999s)]
*  Helping farmers adjust to the ravages of climate change getting the new technologies to be able to predict the weather better or climate resistant seeds [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4842.3s)]
*  We had way more money this last year because congress gave us license to deal now [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4849.58s)]
*  we you know drew a dotted line to to putin's blockading of the ports and and [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4855.58s)]
*  you know the loss of of ukrainian weed exports to to show that the [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4860.62s)]
*  Ravages of climate change were being exacerbated by putin [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4865.9800000000005s)]
*  But at core, you know, we had a billion dollars in new money [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4869.5s)]
*  To work on food security in developing countries. I think it's been much harder for our european [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4873.9800000000005s)]
*  Friends to answer that argument because they are spending in addition to 40 billion dollars [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4879.5s)]
*  In ukraine and on ukraine of non-security assistance along the lines of what usa does which is much more than than even the united states is doing [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4884.860000000001s)]
*  They're spending an additional 17 billion dollars on ukrainian refugees. Yeah [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4893.900000000001s)]
*  We've cut their countries and all of that refugee money [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4897.9s)]
*  could have been counted in the obscure budget processes as [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4901.66s)]
*  Domestic spending but actually it has been counted as development spending [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4906.46s)]
*  And so while countries like germany have increased the overall size of the pie [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4911.5s)]
*  By and large for most european countries. It's been very hard to say that there hasn't been less to spend. Yeah [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4916.46s)]
*  the global south so we whereas we had a kind of [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4922.94s)]
*  A surge of resources to allow us to plus up [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4926.38s)]
*  At just the time climate was going to be intensifying its effects as it is here in the united states [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4930.3s)]
*  Anyway, we we also had an additional [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4935.82s)]
*  Five billion dollars in humanitarian assistance that would not otherwise have been part of our budget [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4939.26s)]
*  But for being able to to secure it through the ukraine supplement [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4944.3s)]
*  So between food security money and humanitarian assistance [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4947.98s)]
*  That's an additional six seven billion dollars that the u.s [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4950.78s)]
*  Has been able to bring to bear in the global south, but it's not well understood [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4953.42s)]
*  And that's a message that I try to send everywhere it goes one of the reasons I try to get out as often as I can [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4957.34s)]
*  To try to draw more attention to the investments that we are making [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4962.86s)]
*  Um, I mean they could still say, you know country, you know for a country of ukraine size versus, you know [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4966.86s)]
*  A country of somalia size is it proportional? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4972.14s)]
*  Um, but the u.s is the largest humanitarian donor in just about all the most vulnerable [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4975.34s)]
*  Afghanistan, syria somalia, etc. Yeah. No, it's a great answer. I mean basically you're not doing less you're doing in fact [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4981.02s)]
*  You're doing more everywhere. That's why it matters a lot [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4986.3s)]
*  You know people a lot of the same people who got behind the house appropriations bill for this coming year [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4989.5s)]
*  Are those who are telling us we need to stand up to the prc and and you know, why aren't we out competing them and this and that? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=4997.1s)]
*  They if the house bill were to stand us aid's budget would be cut by 12 percent [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5003.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's and there'd be no supplementals if if if if their [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5008.7s)]
*  Worldview, uh in a sense were to go forward [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5013.32s)]
*  So, you know, we could see very very dramatic cuts. I may not be able to give you [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5016.62s)]
*  Uh what I hope is a compelling answer. Um, you know within a couple months if we can [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5021.82s)]
*  uh embrace the recognition that [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5027.419999999999s)]
*  You know standing up for this international order leading in the world [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5031.0199999999995s)]
*  Showing an alternative development model to that practice by the prc which is much more extractive and about building dependence [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5034.780000000001s)]
*  But all of that also turns on making actual investments and not thinking you can do it on on the cheap [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5042.46s)]
*  So sam, I understand you also have one more announcement of a new initiative that you're pursuing. What's this about? Well [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5048.7s)]
*  We thought panse the world was with its young audience and its tech-friendly audience would be a great place to to share [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5054.9400000000005s)]
*  That um, one of the things we're trying to do much more of is private sector partnership [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5062.0599999999995s)]
*  And we have partnered uh with a company called skydio [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5066.94s)]
*  Which is a leading u.s drone manufacturer based right there in california [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5071.9s)]
*  and skydio with our [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5076.78s)]
*  ground team willing to support the deployment [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5079.099999999999s)]
*  Is going to provide nine autonomous drones to [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5082.54s)]
*  The office of the prosecutor general of ukraine to help it document war crimes and basically [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5087.18s)]
*  These drones have 4k cameras that are going to be used to take photo and video content to to document war crimes including [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5093.1s)]
*  Of mass graves, uh and other sort of forensic [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5101.82s)]
*  requirements [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5106.6s)]
*  There are about 115 [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5107.900000000001s)]
*  thousand [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5110.52s)]
*  Documented instances of destroyed civilian infrastructure [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5111.74s)]
*  Sadly that number will be going up now with the attacks on the grain infrastructure this week. That's a classic example of intentionally [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5115.82s)]
*  targeting civilian infrastructure, but all the attacks on [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5122.46s)]
*  electricity and and heating [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5125.88s)]
*  Uh infrastructure is part of this and so these drones are now going to be [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5128.679999999999s)]
*  At the service of the prosecutor general of ukraine [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5133.98s)]
*  to look at [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5137.179999999999s)]
*  Occupied frontline communities and liberated territories and I think it's just a great example of going beyond the kind of old way [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5138.62s)]
*  Of doing assistance to bring new tools to bear to support people in need. That's great. I mean marrying [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5146.3s)]
*  Technology with uh [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5154.12s)]
*  Focus on justice it speaks to the innovation of both uh ukraine and and usid under your leadership [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqzV360mPc&t=5156.14s)]
