*  think I've said this before on this podcast like jet lag is one of those things where you feel like you realize you're not [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=20.28s)]
*  30 anymore, you know, it just doesn't go away. Yeah [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=26.78s)]
*  Lingers, you know, yeah 40. Yeah, sometimes I prepare a light anecdote at the top end this time [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=31.02s)]
*  This is a little less so as I think you know last week marked the 50th anniversary of the CIA packed military coup in Chile [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=35.3s)]
*  Yes, when our friend Hank Henry Kissinger [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=42.34s)]

*  Yes, so Ben Kissinger not just a proponent of the coup [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=57.42s)]
*  Maybe the principal architect of the whole thing a an eagle-eyed pod save the world listener who lives in Chile [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=61.18000000000001s)]

*  I mean who was quoted on the Nixon White House tape saying some things are too important to leave up to Chilean voters [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=85.26s)]
*  I think that was the exact quote. I mean just there's no justice in the world. No [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and lester Henry Kissinger and then there's a lot of it. It was like cash. Yeah [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=97.9s)]
*  Unbelievable I just had to bring that up because it's so galling but we have a lot to cover today [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=104.26s)]
*  We got the Canadians accusing the Indian government of assassinating at Canadian citizen on Canadian soil [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=108.1s)]
*  The the US and Iran conducted a prisoner swap that coincides with the one year anniversary of the masa Amini protest movement [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=114.02s)]
*  The UN General Assembly is happening as we speak and we asked the question. Does anyone care? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  BB net yahoo is in the US more Chinese ministers are going missing. There's a Putin stooge rumored dead [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=126.14s)]
*  The Pentagon briefly misplaced a fighter jet and so much more [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=132.9s)]
*  There's a lot going on there's a lot of weird sort of stories going out there [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=136.84s)]
*  And then I just spoke with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=140.86s)]
*  Former British member of Parliament and cabinet minister Rory Stewart about his new book how not to be a politician [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=143.22000000000003s)]
*  The book gets into just how screwed up British government was top to bottom when he got in there like kind of you know selfish [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=149.62s)]
*  You know [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  Superficial members of Parliament one of them threatened to punch him in the face [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=158.62s)]
*  We talked about [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  Government we talked about his his work delivering assistance or an NGO in his post political life talk about the podcast he does [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=164.28s)]
*  The rest is politics and look I think the book will make us all feel a little bit better about the mess [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=172.12s)]
*  That is American politics because they've sort of seemed like they had their shit together the last couple years post Boris or post Liz trust [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=176.08s)]
*  I should say but the book is a nice look back. Yeah, not not entirely have their shit together [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=182.52s)]
*  That was my my read from a couple days in London from your days in the UK [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=187.8s)]
*  Yes, okay [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=191.44s)]
*  So Ben so let's start with this shocking news out of Canada where Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  Said that agents of the government of India carried out an assassination of a sick leader in Canadian citizen on Canadian soil [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=196.84s)]
*  Hardeeb Singh Nijar was murdered in British Columbia in June [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=205.56s)]
*  He was born in India, but has lived in Canada for more than 25 years [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=209.76s)]
*  Nijar's friends believe he was targeted for organizing a non-binding referendum in Canada on whether to create an independent [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=214.17999999999998s)]
*  Six-state back in India. Here's a clip from Canadian Prime Minister [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=220.9s)]
*  Here's a clip from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=225.73999999999998s)]
*  Canada has declared its deep concerns to the top intelligence and security officials of the Indian government [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  last week at the G20 I brought them personally and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=237.29999999999998s)]
*  Directly to Prime Minister Modi in no uncertain terms [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=242.66s)]
*  Any involvement of a foreign government in the killing of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil is an unacceptable [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=248.46s)]
*  violation of our sovereignty [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=257.7s)]
*  It is contrary to the fundamental rules by which free open and democratic societies [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=260.42s)]
*  conduct themselves [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=268.02s)]
*  It's interesting that after the G20 the Indian government put out a statement that referenced concern about extremist elements in Canada [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=269.46s)]
*  So they were kind of getting ready for this to go public [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  So Canada also ordered the expulsion of an Indian intelligence operative and canceled a trade mission to India [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=278.94s)]
*  India says the allegations are absurd [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=284.65999999999997s)]
*  But of course they did tip for tat they kicked out a Canadian diplomat slash intelligence operative working in India last year [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=286.5s)]
*  The Indian government declared that the individual was murdered. Mr [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=293.38s)]
*  Nijar was a terrorist in 2016 they accused him of being involved in a 2007 bombing in a theater [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=296.62s)]
*  There is a large sick diaspora in Canada the 2021 census reported there were [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=303.3s)]
*  770,000 people who call Sikhism their religion [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=309.34s)]
*  Trudeau said he briefed the US and the UK on all this [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=312.94s)]
*  I think Ben that'll probably raise questions about all the chummy group photos with Prime Minister Modi at the G20 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  so Ben this is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=321.34s)]
*  Shocking very troubling I'm preemptively worried that it will get swept under the rug in the name of yeah [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=323.61999999999995s)]
*  Everyone needing India to push back on China for some reason, but what do you think happens now? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=329.02s)]
*  Wow, yeah, this is a big one and you know, I was just in Montreal actually this weekend. I actually saw [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=334.17999999999995s)]
*  Prime, Mr. Trudeau came by [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  Reception we're having and then how's he looking? He's looking very good actually [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=343.17999999999995s)]
*  And I looked high and tight and well, yeah, it was well done. I mean as someone without hair, you know, I [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=346.85999999999996s)]
*  Noted it and then I actually was a moderate panel with Melanie Julie the Prime Minister fantastic [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=353.34s)]
*  Going to come on the pod by the way, nice [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=360.02s)]
*  But any language does she speak like nine probably? Yeah, well more than more than us [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  Let's just say that better English too, but to get serious here. First of all, I [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=366.62s)]
*  like I think we really need to stop here and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=370.9s)]
*  like I know we you know, we've been favorable the true to on this podcast, but [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=374.02s)]
*  I [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=379.02s)]
*  Think it is there's a lot of credit here. Yeah, because it's not easy and there are a lot. It's a smaller country and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=380.5s)]
*  We've seen a lot of countries kind of look the other way at [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=387.5s)]
*  Autocratic behavior, you know put other interests first, you know trade interests or not wanting to like, you know [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=391.26s)]
*  We're rock the boat too much and what I like about this. It was like these are the facts and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=397.38s)]
*  You know [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=402.78s)]
*  I saw today the Indian government came out and kind of aggressively denied this and took some shots of the Canadians [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=403.38s)]
*  Chido came out again and said we reject that denial. We have this information [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=409.1s)]
*  We're just following the facts where they lead and it leads to the conclusion that the Indian government [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=413.42s)]
*  Killed this person by the way, like right outside a seat temple to you [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=419.54s)]
*  I mean, this was a brazen brazen, you know a bunch of guys and masks and guns just you know assassinating somebody [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=423.78000000000003s)]
*  It is part of a very worrying trend in terms of countries doing this generally the most notable one [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=430.78s)]
*  Of course is Khashoggi in Turkey the kind of killing of people outside of the borders [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=437.1s)]
*  I mean, you don't want to see extra just going anywhere but violating kind of the most basic rules of international relations [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=442.98s)]
*  It's a worrying trend about Modi and his government [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=449.82000000000005s)]
*  It's worth pointing out that there's two other Sikh leaders who have mysteriously died around the same time one in Pakistan and one in [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  The UK. Yeah, and we've talked by the way on this podcast about some of their efforts, you know [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=459.82000000000005s)]
*  To roll up a Sikh separatist inside of India, but they shut down internet to an entire province [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=463.97999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the whole state. Yeah, and by the way, like not as if there's some civil war happening in India, too [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, so it speaks to kind of a paranoid autocratic mindset that we see [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=476.78s)]
*  Infusing Indian politics under Modi [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=481.9s)]
*  So that's it's worrying and it's good that judo did this and it's good that by the way credit also to the Canadian conservatives [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=484.38s)]
*  Who have you know got a bit of a MAGA flavor to them of late, but they kind of all rallied together [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=491.88s)]
*  I thought that was like important that that must feel good [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=498.72s)]
*  Yeah, the opposition leader said like if they remember that yeah, he he was very clear on and kind of backing the government on this [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=501.36s)]
*  That's the first point [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=507.12s)]
*  the second point is [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=509.28s)]
*  This is clearly based on Canadian intelligence [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=511.28s)]
*  Canada is part of the five eyes [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=514.04s)]
*  So I would be absolutely shocked if it were not the case that the US and or the UK [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=516.7s)]
*  Australia New Zealand that this is not intelligence that draws on potentially, you know [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=525.14s)]
*  I don't know but like you have to assume that that [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=531.36s)]
*  That this is something that might be based on intelligence that we might have I would hope that the Biden administration [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=535.4200000000001s)]
*  Doesn't duck this thing because it's geopolitically inconvenient because I don't care what your China strategy is [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=542.7s)]
*  I don't care how much of a foot rub, you know Modi got with the state visit and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=550.02s)]
*  This is a very close ally just to the north of us [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=555.22s)]
*  That is a solid friend and partner on everything and if their people in their country are getting killed [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=558.5400000000001s)]
*  We should have something to say about that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=564.7800000000001s)]
*  So I haven't really seen much comment from the US government yet [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=566.46s)]
*  But I would hope that we don't duck this and that leads to the point of like we've talked to this before like I [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=570.04s)]
*  Understand the geopolitical motivation here. India is a country of over a billion people [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=575.04s)]
*  obviously any China strategy would be stronger if India is part of a collection of countries or [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=580.96s)]
*  You know posing certain behavior by the Chinese [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=585.8s)]
*  I I do think we just need to raise the question though like other than these visits and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=587.8s)]
*  What are we what are we getting out of this? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=593.84s)]
*  you know because we're looking the other way at a lot of stuff and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=596.04s)]
*  It's not entirely clear to me. You know Modi's buying Russian oil [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=599.76s)]
*  He's shown up at the BRICS summit and kind of announcing the parallel world order there [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=603.96s)]
*  The G 20 that he hosted had a very weak statement on Ukraine [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=608.04s)]
*  So at some point, you know, I think we need to see what the results are of this [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=611.48s)]
*  And if the result is a leader feeling that he has the impunity to kill people in Canada because he's you know [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=617.6s)]
*  geopolitical hot date [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=624.8s)]
*  That's not a good look, you know [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=626.52s)]
*  No [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=628.88s)]
*  And just for what it's worth there was a we talked about this before a sick [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=629.38s)]
*  Insurgency in the 80s and 90s that killed thousands of people [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=634.36s)]
*  There was a sick extremist who was convicted in the 1985 bombing of an Air India flight that went from Canada [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  To India that killed 329 people on board, but that's you know ancient history [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=645.52s)]
*  We've obviously no evidence that this individual who was assassinated in June was involved in anything [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=650.6s)]
*  Violent like what what are these guys gonna organize and do from Canada? Yeah, I mean a non-binding referendum [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=656.56s)]
*  He was a separatist. He was in favor of there being a separate Sikh state in Punjab [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=662.28s)]
*  Not a crime all true [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=668.24s)]
*  But yeah, like not a crime and and try to resolve that diplomatically you can protest all you want with the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=669.72s)]
*  Canadians India and the Indian government has every right to hammer the Canadian government to complain [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=674.88s)]
*  If they don't like things that are happening and to share evidence if they think someone should be detained [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=680.02s)]
*  But not to go and kill somebody in you know in front of a temple on the other side of the world [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=685.56s)]
*  So like this is a trend, you know, we should be watching of you. We've seen Rwanda [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=691.92s)]

*  So, you know, obviously pudens killed and poisoned people [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=703.88s)]
*  In some all the place Mohammed Salman. So, you know, I don't really want to live in a world where you know [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=707.88s)]

*  Basically iran releases five americans the u.s [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=956.42s)]
*  Dismisses charges against five iranians in u.s custody and the u.s [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=959.86s)]
*  Unfreezes six billion in iranian assets that have been stuck in south korea because of u.s sanctions basically [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=964.02s)]
*  That money came from what were was at the time lawful iranian oil sales to south korea [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=970.42s)]
*  And then they get that cash got frozen by u.s sanctions [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=975.86s)]
*  The six billion gets transferred to a bank account in qatar where iran can use it to pay for food [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=978.8199999999999s)]
*  Agricultural products medicine things like that diplomacy fans like us [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=984.16s)]
*  Hope that this swap is some sort of confidence building mechanism could lead to more talks more agreements [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=988.9s)]
*  Republicans say this deal will incentivize more kidnapping [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=994.56s)]
*  These funds will allow ron to spend this other cash they have on weapons or other malign activities [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=998.9s)]
*  Uh sort of the same old arguments you always hear but very good news obviously for the families of these hostages [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1004.98s)]
*  I don't know ben maybe we're not in dc so we're like not in the thick of the bullshit [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1011.3s)]
*  But this doesn't seem like it has reached like the fever pitch that the pallets of cash did or the burgdahl [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1015.3000000000001s)]
*  Prisoner swap did back in the obama days [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1023.22s)]
*  Uh, do you agree with that and like how hopeful are you that this could lead to more diplomacy? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1025.78s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they're the republicans are kind of running the same play [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1030.58s)]
*  I noticed there's like three different hearings on iran policy and and yet it just doesn't feel like the temperature is that hot [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1034.5s)]
*  There's a lot of reasons for that. I think the the chief reason is [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1042.58s)]
*  As we said before like when this stuff was happening around 2015 [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1045.94s)]
*  It was kind of the main event in our politics for a few months like the iran deal and everything now you've got [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1049.86s)]
*  You know in domestic politics a government shutdown. You've got an impeachment proceeding that makes no sense [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1054.98s)]
*  Then internationally you've got a hot war in ukraine. You've got a much more [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1059.94s)]
*  Intense geopolitical competition with china. It just feels like this is not the same [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1063.7s)]
*  Temperature level no matter how much republicans will freak out and there's something kind of healthy about that. Yeah, you know [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1069.06s)]
*  now I do think that [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1075.46s)]
*  This was a multi-step process [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1077.3799999999999s)]
*  And so the fact that each of the steps kind of came off as was described at the beginning of the process [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1079.54s)]
*  They're released from prison then they're you know in iran for a period of time and then there's allowed to come back [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1085.06s)]
*  And then this money moves around [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1090.26s)]
*  It does feel like a confidence building measure can we trust each other to follow through on a deal [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1093.06s)]
*  Will the iranian government which is under different leadership than when we made those deals in 2015 [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1098.74s)]
*  Follow through on something they did [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1103.62s)]
*  The question is can this lead to nuclear diplomacy that at least freezes the state of the iranian program in exchange for [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1105.7s)]
*  You know probably a larger version of this like the iranians get some of the money that has been frozen that is their money [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1112.26s)]
*  Um through creative accounting, uh, and look if it sounds kind of [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1117.6999999999998s)]
*  Shady like it has to go to some qatar bank. Well, that's for a couple reasons one because of our sanctions [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1123.1399999999999s)]
*  Um, it has to be kind of circuitous [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1128.9799999999998s)]
*  But also because we're trying to limit where this money goes [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1131.62s)]
*  And so the fact that it's in this kind of receivership in qatar is in part a mechanism to ensure that it goes for these humanitarian [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1135.54s)]
*  purposes [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  So all in all like diplomacy is always complicated it always involves compromise people are home confidence has been built [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1143.14s)]
*  Um, this is a relatively small amount of money compared to what iran has lost [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1151.14s)]
*  Of their own money in the enforcement sanctions and hopefully it leads to some breakthrough in the nuclear file [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1156.26s)]
*  Yeah, and hopefully fox continues to give more coverage like john federman and the senate dress code than than this story [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1161.22s)]
*  Um, it is worth noting. I missed that by the way [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1167.3000000000002s)]
*  Like I've saw that in our text chain and and you're so good [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1169.3s)]
*  You know, i'm not like it's plugged into the domestic silliness [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1172.26s)]
*  But if they want to cover john federman's hoodies and not the iran agreement, that's fine. They're obsessed with it [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1175.62s)]
*  That's good obsessed with it. We could have used federman in his hoodies back in 2015. Yeah [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1180.5s)]
*  So it is worth noting that there are some iranian activists who are not happy about the this deal at least the timing because it comes [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1184.82s)]
*  Right at the one year anniversary of the death of masa amini [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1191.3s)]
*  Who is the 22 year old woman who was murdered by iran's so-called morality police? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1194.74s)]
*  That murder led to these huge protests and then a brutal crackdown on the protesters [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1199.94s)]
*  Human rights groups believe that up to 500 protesters have been killed in the past year [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1204.42s)]
*  I think at least seven were arrested and then executed. Uh, tens of thousands have been detained [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1209.06s)]
*  Because they are the shittiest people in the world [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1215.3s)]
*  Iranian security forces prevented masa amini's family from visiting her grave on the anniversary of her death and they briefly arrested her father [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1218.18s)]
*  Uh, some iranian activists say, you know the timing of this [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1225.7s)]
*  Swap or this news is a slap in the face [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1228.98s)]
*  To the people who've been putting their lives on the line to protest. I will say like I I completely understand that frustration [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1231.86s)]
*  Uh, the timing definitely is unfortunate [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1238.18s)]
*  Substantively though. I just I don't know that the ultra hardline approach is helping anyone at the moment [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1241.36s)]
*  And I just I don't know it would be hard for me to justify [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1247.78s)]
*  Letting these americans rot in prison any longer because the timing felt bad, but I don't know what you think no look [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1250.8999999999999s)]
*  It's interesting. I mean the iranians might have had the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1258.82s)]
*  They might have done this timing intentionally. I mean because this deal has kind of been in the works for a while [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1262.18s)]
*  It was kind of announced a few weeks ago [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1266.58s)]
*  so that's possible and that's cynical and terrible and and [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1269.22s)]
*  For the iranians to do that. Um [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1273.78s)]
*  And I understand the frustration of those people [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1276.1s)]
*  Um who are complaining about the timing I would say though like to your point [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1278.66s)]
*  We can either get people home or not [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1283.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, we can either try to stop the iranians from crossing certain nuclear thresholds or not [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1285.06s)]
*  And and I don't think that the ultra hardline position [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1290.1s)]
*  you know was on the precipice of of causing the iranian government to collapse or [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1294.42s)]
*  You know to make huge concessions to that protest movement [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1299.3799999999999s)]
*  I think ultimately what's going to change things inside of iran or or or iranians and the pressure that's building up from within [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1302.66s)]
*  Um, so, you know, this is you do diplomacy like this with adversaries [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1308.8200000000002s)]
*  Um, I I don't think put it this way. I just think [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1314.5s)]
*  Not doing this agreement [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1318.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't think would lead to any different outcome with that protest movement as as tragic as it is [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1320.02s)]
*  I wish it would but but you know, I I think that you you try to accomplish what you can while keeping the spotlight [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1324.5800000000002s)]
*  On the movement that has inspired so many people over the last year [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1331.7s)]
*  Yeah, if you want to learn more about this prisoner deal a friend of the pod jason rizayan who was himself held in iran for [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1335.78s)]
*  544 days held hostage. Uh did an interview with brett magurk in the washington post. That's worth reading brett was the one who negotiated the deal [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1342.72s)]
*  Um, and and we should say jason and his wife yegi are huge supporters of the protest movement [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1349.78s)]
*  Yes, and I think jason's also supportive of this step. So, you know shows there's there's nuance here. Yeah, there's a lot of nuance [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1353.94s)]
*  so ben [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1359.6200000000001s)]
*  The united nations general assembly or unga as we call it in nerd world is happening as we speak [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1361.14s)]
*  Um, I think it's fair to ask whether it will accomplish anything other than pissing off all of minhattan because of the traffic [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1366.8200000000002s)]
*  So the leaders of france britain china in india won't be attending putin won't be there either, but he's got kind of a [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1374.26s)]
*  A decent excuse with in the form of an icc arrest warrant [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1382.0200000000002s)]
*  So [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1385.06s)]
*  unga will be important for president zelensky and the ukrainians who are trying to have as many meetings as possible to rally support for their [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1385.86s)]
*  Cause uh president biden gave a speech on tuesday. Here's a clip russia believes the world [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1392.74s)]
*  Will grow weary [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1399.3799999999999s)]
*  And allow it to brutalize ukraine without consequence [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1401.06s)]
*  But I ask you this [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1405.06s)]
*  If we abandon the core principles of the united states to appease an aggressor [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1407.3s)]
*  Can any member? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1411.9399999999998s)]
*  State in this body feel confident that they are protected [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1413.86s)]
*  If we allow ukraine to be carved up [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1419.22s)]
*  Is the independence of any nation secure? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1422.34s)]
*  I'd respectfully suggest the answer is no [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1426.5s)]
*  We have to stand up to this naked aggression today [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1429.94s)]
*  And deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow so you hear biden they're trying to make a an argument that supporting ukraine is bigger than just [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1433.06s)]
*  the current fight [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1439.94s)]
*  Um, so ben let's talk about unga itself for a minute. Do you think [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1441.38s)]
*  The poor attendance this year is because the world has maybe decided that the un [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1445.7s)]
*  Is not the place where you get a lot done or could this be more mundane like there was just the g20 [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1451.0600000000002s)]
*  Everyone went to india now. There's the un general assembly. I think the next cop meeting is in a couple weeks [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1456.5s)]
*  Maybe that's just too much travel for these world leaders in too little time. I don't know. I'm making excuses here [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1462.0200000000002s)]
*  No, I think I well I think the two things are related I I think unga does not matter nearly as much as it used to [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1466.6599999999999s)]
*  And i'll talk about that in a second and I think the g20 timing is actually evidence of that [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1472.5s)]
*  So in other words the g20 I think has become what unga used to be [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1478.26s)]
*  Right unga used to be the place where all the major powers got together [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1482.4199999999998s)]
*  To to take on whatever the global agenda was at that moment [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1485.78s)]
*  And the reality is there used to be some separation intentionally between the g20 and unga [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1489.78s)]
*  Um most years at least [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1494.8999999999999s)]
*  This year, it's like well, we had the real meeting [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1497.1399999999999s)]
*  Which was in india at the g20 and most people showed up for that except sheshe pang and pudin [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1499.62s)]
*  But now the list of countries not showing up to this thing is really long [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1505.06s)]
*  It's even like rishi sunak who I think is you know, he's in his fantasy camp of being prime minister [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1508.34s)]
*  He may not have another turn at it and even he's not showing up for like for unga [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1513.3799999999999s)]
*  You know biden is the only head of state from the five permanent security council members [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1518.58s)]
*  Like hey rishi like you're you guys are clinging to that perm rep seat by a thread pal [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1522.74s)]
*  Like maybe show up for the meeting and the reality though is that that the un is [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1527.46s)]
*  This is one of the biggest stories in the world that doesn't get a lot of attention [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1532.1s)]
*  The un is totally broken and it's not the fault of like un personnel. Some of whom most of them are wonderful [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1535.22s)]
*  It's because it's been broken by the member states, right? So biden is absolutely right the most foundational [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1541.62s)]
*  Reason for the un to exist is to prevent a war just like the war in ukraine where one big country kind of swallows up [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1546.6799999999998s)]
*  Tries to swallow up a smaller one [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1553.8799999999999s)]
*  The reality is that the security council will never deal with that or any other issue because russia and china won't allow it to [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1555.6399999999999s)]
*  um [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1561.48s)]
*  And and so the security council is no longer a venue to solve any international security problem [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1562.36s)]
*  Even ones that seem like there should be shared interests like a war in sudan or something [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1567.0s)]
*  Um, so the security council doesn't really matter in the same way that it once did [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1571.9599999999998s)]
*  And then there are these other meetings the bricks meeting the g20 meeting the cop meeting which a lot of countries will show up [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1575.96s)]
*  at in a few weeks [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1583.48s)]
*  That feel like you know, that's where real business is done [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1585.48s)]
*  UNGA is basically a reason for there to be a bunch of bilateral meetings in new york city right now [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1588.2s)]
*  It's like you're all in the same place at the same time. You might as well hang out. Yeah, and and and you know [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1592.3600000000001s)]
*  There's that's why i'd go by the way if I was reaching no, that's true [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1596.44s)]
*  And there's yeah, there's all these side events and there's a lot of development work done around the sustainable development goals [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1599.3200000000002s)]
*  And there's you know, and so there's stuff to do [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1604.52s)]
*  I mean i'm actually going to new york like twice the next couple weeks for for things that are of that nature [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1606.68s)]
*  But I just don't think it matters anywhere. It's not it's not the fault of the u.s. Government. This is just [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1611.96s)]
*  The un doesn't work the way it was meant to anymore at some point [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1617.64s)]
*  There's gonna have to be some significant overhaul and reform of the un system [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1621.72s)]
*  That's very hard when the biggest countries in the world totally disagree right and the permanent members, right? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1625.8s)]
*  You got russia and china gumming up anything that we try to do internationally and then you have the non-permanent members [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1630.28s)]
*  Which right now includes gabon which has had a coup. Yeah, so no one knows how to deal with them [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1635.96s)]
*  The us hasn't recognized it as a coup yet nor have we recognized niger as a coup yet [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1640.52s)]
*  Yeah, so yeah, it's incredibly complicated and uh, the processes are broken and no one has figured out [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1644.84s)]
*  I'm nostalgic for the you know, the old lunga like the good old days [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1649.0s)]
*  Yeah, the good old days, you know big multilateral meetings in like lots of different countries and gadaffi giving a two-hour speech [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1652.2s)]
*  Pitching a tent at trump's place in bedminster that actually happened [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1658.36s)]
*  um, and then like the [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1661.6399999999999s)]
*  The bar at the waldofa store [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1664.04s)]
*  I mean you knew that yeah, like things were already going bad when the the chinese bought bought the waldof [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1665.8799999999999s)]
*  So we couldn't stay there anymore because he's probably gonna be full of listening devices, you know [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1671.8799999999999s)]
*  So it's just it's just not what it was. You know, it is not [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1676.04s)]
*  I mean you remember in 2009 obama went chaired a security council session that passed a resolution on non-proliferation nuclear non-proliferation [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1679.08s)]
*  There was a pretty big deal like there was big business being done at unga and we did a bunch of middle east peace stuff [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1686.7s)]
*  right and we did sudan like, you know the whole like, uh midwifing of um, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1691.26s)]
*  The south sudan independence like there's just a lot of stuff that that kind of stuff doesn't happen at unga anymore [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1696.7s)]
*  And so, you know after the un security council meetings, uh, zelensky is going to go to washington [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1702.7s)]
*  He's going to meet with members of congress. There's a bipartisan meeting on the senate side [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1707.9s)]
*  Where he's probably got enough support to get more funding [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1713.74s)]
*  Uh, I wonder [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1717.34s)]
*  What kind of meetings he'll get with the republicans on the house side. There's real concern at the moment about uh, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1719.18s)]
*  You know congress passing any funding belt let alone with an extra 20 billion for ukraine [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1726.54s)]
*  The new york times ben had a big piece about how zelensky's tone is shifting from kind of pressuring countries and maybe scolding people a little bit [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1732.22s)]
*  to gratitude i'm sure that's [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1739.74s)]
*  So grating for him, you know given what ukraine is experiencing, but it's also probably smart politics given how the vibe in washington right now [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1742.46s)]
*  I think um, first of all, you know [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1750.5400000000002s)]
*  The zelensky's trip here the the dc piece is much more important than the new york piece [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1753.66s)]
*  I mean he hit the notes today about the global food crisis, but it kind of feels like [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1757.74s)]
*  Enlisting a lot of global south countries to the ukrainian side is just not happening [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1762.46s)]
*  That doesn't mean he shouldn't do that work but i'm curious about the kevin mccarthy meeting [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1767.9s)]
*  You know because kevin mccarthy is a real tough guy talking about no blank checks for ukraine and stuff when he's doing like right-wing media [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1772.38s)]
*  um, i'm trying to imagine kevin mccarthy sitting across the table from zelensky and telling him, you know, uh, I can't [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1778.3s)]
*  Provide you with this assistance because matt gates might force a vote against me [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1784.3s)]
*  Yeah, because matt gates might be mean to you. I mean it just think about that like there's like tens of thousands ukrainians dying [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1788.14s)]
*  And kevin mccarthy's more afraid of matt gates than you know, he is committed to supporting ukraine [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1794.0600000000002s)]
*  um, I think you know what he wants to do zelensky is [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1799.3400000000001s)]
*  Really fortify [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1802.94s)]
*  Not only the democrats but the republicans who do agree with him so that they become more invested in pressuring mccarthy and the crazy house republicans [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1804.6200000000001s)]
*  I think probably what we're looking at here tommy is like and this gets in domestic politics, but like [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1813.5s)]
*  There's gonna be a government shutdown. Maybe [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1818.3000000000002s)]
*  There'll be some huge [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1820.94s)]
*  End of the year spending package that some i'm sure they'll ram the ukraine assistance into that [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1822.7s)]
*  And you know the matt gates is of the world both are tantrum and kevin mccarthy will yell [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1829.02s)]
*  I think what zelensky did that was also interesting and notable [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1833.5s)]
*  Is after replacing the defense minister [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1837.4199999999998s)]
*  The new defense minister fired every deputy defense minister as like the first thing that he did essentially [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1840.06s)]
*  I think they're really trying to send a message that they're rooting out corruption [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1846.06s)]
*  one thing that [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1850.7s)]
*  I think should be considered with assistance is greater [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1852.54s)]
*  kind of inspector general mechanisms to track look [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1856.3799999999999s)]
*  The ukrainians wouldn't have fired all those people if there wasn't a corruption problem [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1860.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, clearly there is a corruption problem. That's not to say that [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1863.26s)]
*  Most of this aid is going in the wrong direction. Yeah, it's something that is reported to like overpriced eggs [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1866.78s)]
*  It's yeah, exactly. This is not like people stealing, you know abram's tanks or something. This is people [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1870.3799999999999s)]
*  Double counting for food and you know things like this [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1876.22s)]
*  But you know good to kind of show that you're taking that seriously [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1879.74s)]
*  Um, I think the issue is that they'll get probably that next package [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1883.02s)]
*  But that's probably the last bit they're going to get before our election [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1887.34s)]
*  You know definitely and so the whole next year. I mean part of why he's shifting gratitude is it [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1890.1399999999999s)]
*  You know he can go to europe and try to get smaller, you know installments [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1895.4199999999998s)]
*  But whatever he gets from us this time is that's kind of it [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1899.4199999999998s)]
*  You know that and whatever the you know few billion dollars the pentagon finds buried in the cushions [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1902.62s)]
*  You know, yeah [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1908.38s)]
*  Well, let's talk more about russian ukraine because you mentioned uh, these six deputy defense ministers that have been sacked summarily fired [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1909.02s)]
*  They didn't say why as you noted but it does seem likely it's about corruption. You mentioned abram's tanks [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1915.9s)]
*  Uh back in january the u.s. Announced we'd be giving 31 abram's tanks to ukraine. Apparently they're like just now [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1920.46s)]
*  Showing up so they might make it to the battlefield in time for the very end of this spring turned summer turned now fall offensive where [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1927.34s)]
*  There certainly hasn't been the kind of progress I think people were hoping to see but it does sound like in some areas [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1934.54s)]
*  The ukrainians are maybe starting to exhaust some russian forces near bakhmut [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1940.7s)]
*  There's another point in the south where I think they've broken through the first line of defenses [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1945.1s)]
*  Uh in some small areas and maybe now that could lead to a broader breakthrough. We'll see [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1951.26s)]
*  also ben [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1956.78s)]
*  There was a report in the new york times [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1958.1399999999999s)]
*  That this awful missile strike that hit a market in eastern ukraine on september 6th [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1961.02s)]
*  And killed 15 civilians was actually friendly fire. It was a ukrainian air defense missile that you know went [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1967.1000000000001s)]
*  Went to the wrong place and landed on ukrainian soil. Um, finally there are rumors swirling [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1973.82s)]
*  That putin stooge and chechen warlord ramzan kadirov is in a coma. Maybe he's sick [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1980.46s)]
*  Maybe he just did too much mma and he's like really sleepy. I don't know. Maybe he's dead [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1987.5s)]
*  His instagram account posted a video of kadirov walking around saying like, uh, you know, he's fine [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1992.46s)]
*  Go outside just like loser or something some sort of like trolley internet speak, but you know, he's a terrible person [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=1999.26s)]
*  Um, his forces have been accused of committing horrific atrocities. So if kadirov were somehow [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2005.74s)]
*  Off the battlefield that might be a good thing. Yeah, if you listen to uh, another rush of the podcast [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2011.26s)]
*  I do with janem sova kadirov also [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2016.78s)]
*  Seemingly implicated in the assassination of boris nemsov. Just a horrible horrible person. Um, when was that was that oh five or six? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2019.74s)]
*  No, that was in uh, um [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2027.5s)]
*  2015 oh shit. Oh so later. Yeah. Yeah, because his father was in charge, right? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2030.52s)]
*  Like his father took power in like i think 2003. I think ramzan took over in [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2034.54s)]
*  2007. Yeah, that would make sense if he was sort of yeah [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2039.24s)]
*  He was uh trying he was constantly trying to kind of prove, you know, uh his [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2041.98s)]
*  The trade-off that he has with pudin which is he gets to kind of have his own militia and do what the hell he wants [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2046.1399999999999s)]
*  Down in chechnya, but he does a bunch of dirty work for uh [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2050.06s)]
*  for pudin, but I mean it'd be pretty interesting if if prugosian and and kadirov both, uh, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2053.9s)]
*  Like kick the bucket here before [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2059.8199999999997s)]
*  You know two years into this war [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2061.74s)]
*  I mean not that there's with kadirov it seems like there's probably not a linkage but [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2063.18s)]
*  Those are two of the kind of most odious characters that were carrying out pudin's dirty work. We're changing the card. Yeah [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2066.38s)]
*  Yes, probably not [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2072.06s)]
*  Replaced by much better people but um, look your your basic update is I mean the the one thing we should say is that last year [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2073.98s)]
*  When ukraine had those big breakthroughs in kyrgyzstan in the south and and karkiv in the north it was kind of in the fall [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2082.7s)]
*  but [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2090.54s)]
*  Russia's more dug in this time more, you know more trenches and so if the front line solidifies, I think these questions around [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2091.42s)]
*  Negotiation may come up but pudin has no incentive to negotiate until he knows result of our election [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2098.92s)]
*  Right. So I just think we're kind of in a stalemate [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2103.34s)]
*  Um, hopefully with some gains for ukraine until you know [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2106.06s)]
*  We know who the next president united states is the other thing the krainians are seemingly doing with great effect is [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2109.42s)]
*  hammering targets in uh, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2115.08s)]
*  Crimea with missile strikes and they also [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2117.34s)]
*  Nearly either took out a another major russian ship and maybe even a submarine that were at port getting repaired [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2120.54s)]
*  So, you know, they're having some tactical successes, um, but then back to the un general assembly [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2125.7400000000002s)]
*  So on wednesday president biden is going to meet with israeli prime minister bb netanyahu in new york [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2130.3s)]
*  It's their first face-to-face since bb came back to power. The meeting is not held was not held at the white house [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2135.34s)]
*  Uh to show biden's displeasure with netanyahu's recent attacks on the israeli judiciary [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2141.1800000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu will be fresh off his meeting with elon musk helping him mop up after some anti-semitism charges and some attacks on the adl [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2147.7400000000002s)]
*  So that's a lot of fun [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2155.1000000000004s)]
*  Some things that could be on the agenda for biden and bb [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2156.54s)]
*  Uh, hopefully [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2160.62s)]
*  Biden pushes puts a ton of pressure on him to stop with this judicial coup that he's undertaking midway through it [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2162.14s)]
*  I would love to hear biden press netnyahu on stopping the export of israeli spyware to bad actors [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2168.62s)]
*  Uh harretz had a big piece about how israeli cyber companies have figured out how to use advertising technology tack our phones. That's fun [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2174.54s)]
*  Uh, the washington post reported that one recent victim of an attack from the israeli-made pegasus spyware [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2181.98s)]
*  Was the editor of medusa news one of the last independent news outlets in russia all the good guys getting attacked by this [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2189.18s)]
*  Israeli spyware and then ben there's almost certainly going to be talk about this [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2196.14s)]
*  Uh frequently floated now israeli saudi, uh saudi arabia normalization deal [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2200.38s)]
*  There were reports over the weekend that the saudis had declared the talks dead [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2206.62s)]
*  But the new york times reported today that they're still kind of happening [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2210.54s)]
*  And that it could include a mutual defense agreement like the ones the u.s has with south korea and japan [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2214.62s)]
*  So ben, I don't know man. Like I wish biden wasn't [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2221.42s)]
*  Meeting with bb at all. Um, tony blinking assured us and I believe him [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2224.94s)]
*  That they wouldn't do a deal that wasn't in the u.s interests [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2229.7400000000002s)]
*  I just am so skeptical of how a deal with this guy or nbs would ever be in the u.s interest [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2232.54s)]
*  But what do you think will come out of this? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2237.98s)]
*  I mean, I I assume that the main topic is the saudi normalization deal [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2239.7400000000002s)]
*  I think part of what's interesting about that is [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2243.9s)]
*  It's ostensibly an israel saudi normalization deal, but it it's basically us saudi negotiation. Um, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2246.86s)]
*  and so [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2253.34s)]
*  I presume what's happening is that biden is going back to bb and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2254.7s)]
*  How do you feel about us building a nuclear program saudi arabia like, uh, what will you do for the palestinians? It might make the saudis [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2259.1s)]
*  Feel like at least optically they can do this deal like it's it's all kind of gross. I mean you have to [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2267.3399999999997s)]
*  Do it I guess but um, i'm glad he's not at the white house. Uh, I I i'm yet to see [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2274.2999999999997s)]
*  either he or nbs [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2281.2599999999998s)]
*  Kind of take steps that indicate that this normalization deal is something that [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2283.5s)]
*  You know is is good for us. Um, they um, it's you hear a lot about this deal from the u.s officials and like tom [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2289.2599999999998s)]
*  Friedman, you know and at a certain point, you know, what what are the views of the saudis and the and the israelis on this thing? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2296.7s)]
*  You know, yeah, I mean right again tony when we talked to tony blinken last week secretary of state [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2303.58s)]
*  He was quite clear that they wouldn't be good with a deal that didn't include some real meaningful progress [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2308.7s)]
*  He did say that yeah, yeah [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2315.18s)]
*  And so i'm just trying to imagine any scenario where netanyahu's [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2317.2599999999998s)]
*  Cabinet allows that to happen because they don't want to foreclose annexation of the west bank [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2321.08s)]
*  That they're kind of dedicated to that right is kind of like core part of their identity favorite thing [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2326.86s)]
*  Yeah, and so I mean I guess like the and the other question is like in the interim [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2331.1s)]
*  It's not as if they should be you know, the the kind of uh, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2335.58s)]
*  impunity for settler violence the kind of intimidation displacement of palestinians that we've seen [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2339.4s)]
*  I hope that's on the agenda too and not just kind of like what kind of symbolic announcements might they make you know around [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2344.3s)]
*  a saudi normalization deal [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2351.34s)]
*  So I don't know [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2352.7000000000003s)]
*  It's uh, i'm always a little cynical when it comes to bb because bb is the most cynical [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2353.5800000000004s)]
*  Personal one of the most cynical people on earth. So, um, we'll see what comes out of it [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2358.46s)]
*  Uh, not not hugely optimistic here detested by generations of american officials [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2363.02s)]

*  Than to not talk the fact that it is jake sullivan meeting with the foreign minister [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2473.5s)]
*  Um instead of tony blinken it does suggest that maybe it is about some g [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2477.98s)]
*  Biden communication, right? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2483.98s)]

*  Making use of mass surveillance technology like you become a harder intelligence target, you know [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2616.94s)]
*  And i'm sure that means that there's a lot of intelligence efforts in like third countries and things like that [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2622.86s)]
*  And at the same time as we talked about last week, we've seen china get much more aggressive [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2628.7000000000003s)]

*  The pilot ejected from his plane somewhere near charleston south carolina [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2655.98s)]
*  U.s radar lost track of the thing somehow if I were the military i'd spin this and say turns out a stealth technology [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2660.3s)]
*  Is just too good. Yeah, but um, so the joint-based charleston twitter account tweets out the following message quote [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2666.2200000000003s)]

*  F-35 was trending along with havana and cat turd [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2694.14s)]

*  Should have been enlisted. I mean it seems like uh, you know [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2738.62s)]
*  It's he wouldn't have bailed out of that thing. He wouldn't have bailed out that he would have figured out where to land it [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2741.58s)]
*  No offense to the pilot. Uh, yeah. No, it's not great and and it it is a [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2745.42s)]
*  It's an expensive piece of hardware [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2750.46s)]
*  I mean when people talk about cost over runs in the pentagon the f-35 program is on that list [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2751.82s)]
*  So like a one point something trillion dollar program feed a lot of people with that one plane [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2756.62s)]

*  All right, it's been a while since we've had a good. Yeah. Yeah. This is a bbc news headline [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2814.14s)]
*  australian man fined for taking pet snake surfing [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2818.62s)]
*  This guy I think is him higor fusa. I don't know. He took his carpet python shiva surfing [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2823.1s)]
*  Then he filmed it and he put it on instagram [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2828.94s)]
*  So I find it disappointing and I just learned of this that there's a regulation on the books and I would think that in australia [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2830.86s)]
*  You could if there's anywhere in the world where I I would think that you'd be allowed to take your pet python surfing [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2837.42s)]
*  I would think that that would be australia. Yeah [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2843.5s)]
*  Now do I want to be in the water and see that coming towards me? Not particularly no, but I kind of feel like [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2845.18s)]
*  That's the Aussie vibe. I mean, yeah [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2851.02s)]
*  Well, so what his mistake was putting on instagram because it made him a local celebrity [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2853.18s)]
*  But it got the uh, the queensland department of environment got their attention science. Yeah on his radar [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2857.4199999999996s)]
*  They fined him 1500 bucks for endangering the snake mostly because it's a it's a it's a cold-blooded animal [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2863.5s)]
*  Yeah, so you put him in the water. It's like what but um [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2869.98s)]
*  That's the right approach to the problem that I like that the approach was more about the snake than the people [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2873.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, it's like and they're worried about spreading disease [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2877.82s)]
*  But here's a clip of the the dude who took the snake surfing [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2879.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, she goes for a swim a little bit and it comes back to the board [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2882.86s)]
*  She's just cruising waiting for the wave for the perfect way [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2886.46s)]
*  So he also said like she loves it [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2890.3s)]
*  Usually when she doesn't like something she starts hissing, but she doesn't hiss in the water. She's always chill [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2892.6200000000003s)]
*  Um, every time we have one of these australia segments the interview clip is perfect. It's exactly how I'd want it to be [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2898.06s)]
*  So you'll love this apparently this same beach is home to an equally famous body surfing duck named duck [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2903.74s)]
*  There's some family owns a duck. They took it out in the ocean with them and it just like it caught one wave and was like [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2912.7799999999997s)]
*  Fuck yeah, this is what I do now [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2917.9s)]
*  We do need to we do need to do some live content in in australia [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2920.7s)]
*  We have to figure out how to do it [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2923.98s)]
*  But if we go people will have to collect for us like a whole range of these stories and we may need to interview some [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2925.18s)]
*  Of these people all of them. Yeah, but to your point about the fine [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2930.7s)]
*  I mean you got to figure like the queensland department of environment and science like they've seen some shit [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2933.34s)]
*  They've seen some shit man. Like they've seen some animals that you and I can't even imagine what they look like [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2938.62s)]

*  I think it was an australian woman who like was having some [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2954.54s)]
*  Like fainting and stuff or like lightheaded and memory issues and they found like a worm in her brain [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=2957.98s)]

*  You have to clarify this for me, but rory stewart welcome to the show. Well, thank you. And firstly the book [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3076.32s)]
*  Is called in the u.s. How not to be a politician and the book [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3081.6000000000004s)]
*  Which has just been published is an attempt to try to describe what it's like to find [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3085.68s)]
*  A populist in our case boris johnson [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3091.2799999999997s)]
*  Taking over a right-wing party and dragging politics to the extremes and what it might feel like for [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3094.08s)]
*  The progressive center to fail to fight against that and then what it might take to try to fight back [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3101.68s)]
*  And I hope it's a book that [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3106.56s)]
*  Has relevance for american readers european readers as well as british. Oh, it feels very relevant. Also. I want to say welcome [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3108.56s)]
*  To the podcasting game your you had enormous success, but you're a new entry. So just pro tip for you [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3115.04s)]
*  Um, if you ever want to end a conversation clear a room tell people you're in the podcasting business [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3121.28s)]
*  It'll shut it down. They'll just walk away. That's the answer is it just like that is so boring [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3127.76s)]
*  You don't need to tell them that you're a forensic accountant or anything. You just say you're a podcast [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3131.76s)]
*  No, just say podcasting. Um, this is a challenging interview for me [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3136.8s)]
*  There's so much I would like to talk with you about but let's start with the book [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3139.84s)]
*  You have a piece in the atlantic this week that is adapted from the book about boris johnson [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3143.36s)]
*  Basically throwing you out of the tory party because you wouldn't go along with his brexit plan [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3148.1600000000003s)]
*  There's an audio excerpt on the rest is politics podcast feed that folks should check out. It's very fun [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3151.92s)]
*  My question for you [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3158.8s)]
*  for a long time [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3160.56s)]
*  Progressives in the u.s in the uk we could kind of cry on each other's shoulders [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3162.86s)]
*  We could at least feel like we are not alone in terms of having the most buffoonish dishonest leaders [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3167.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh running our countries [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3172.96s)]
*  But now it seems like there's a 50 50 chance that trump will be the next president [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3174.96s)]
*  While voters in the uk seem to have moved on from johnson. What's your secret? How did you guys do it? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3179.2000000000003s)]
*  How can we follow suit? Well, I think the first thing is that we shouldn't get too optimistic too soon [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3184.96s)]
*  That the truth of the matter is yes, it's great that boris johnson who was a [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3190.2400000000002s)]
*  Clown [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3195.3599999999997s)]
*  He was a terrible human being. He was a terrible prime minister. It's great that we've got rid of him [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3196.96s)]
*  But the underlying causes that drove his success the underlying causes that created populism in the u.s or the uk europe haven't gone away [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3201.8399999999997s)]
*  And that's basically because the economic system which you and I and many others believed in didn't really deliver for people properly [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3210.64s)]
*  The 2008 financial crisis was a terrible exposure of many of the problems that we had in our countries [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3219.12s)]
*  Many of our promises about democracy and international relations failed and I think the populists [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3225.6s)]
*  Were right in a lot of their criticisms [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3232.0s)]
*  Where they're wrong is in their solutions and I think the that the danger in britain [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3235.52s)]
*  Is that yes at the moment we've got these two pretty [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3240.64s)]
*  Boring middle of the road apparently politicians in the form of rishi sunek and kirstama [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3243.6s)]
*  One of them a banker the other one a lawyer that they're not famous for their sense of humor [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3248.72s)]
*  They don't seem to have any ideological divisions [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3252.96s)]
*  but [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3255.52s)]
*  The populist move is still very much there and the chances are that if rishi sunek loses the next election, which seems very likely [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3256.4s)]
*  The conservative party will again take a big lurch to the right and again [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3264.96s)]
*  Be very dominated by an anti-immigrant [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3269.3599999999997s)]
*  nationalist [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3272.4599999999996s)]
*  culture war populist fringe is that in the form of someone like suela breverman or do you think there could be a [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3273.6s)]
*  boris johnson comeback well boris johnson obviously [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3280.48s)]
*  Fantasizes a lot about comeback. Um, I I think the the way in which he finished himself [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3283.8999999999996s)]
*  Is not his many horrific things. I mean like donald trump. He challenged our constitution. He tried to lock the doors on parliament [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3290.3999999999996s)]
*  He lied to the queen. He insulted the supreme court [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3297.2799999999997s)]
*  He lied to parliament. He he [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3301.04s)]
*  Appointed completely inappropriate people corruptly to office [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3303.8399999999997s)]
*  He was forgiven for a lot of that by his voter base what they won't forgive him for [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3307.8399999999997s)]
*  Is that he mocked them by essentially partying during covet? He implemented these very stringent covet lockdowns and then was caught [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3313.12s)]
*  Partying in 10 downing street in the prime minister's office during that period [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3321.52s)]
*  So I think he's damaged badly by that. Um, and [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3325.28s)]
*  It you need to imagine [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3329.84s)]
*  Donald trump being caught doing something that would really be seen as betraying his base. Yeah, that's fair [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3332.2400000000002s)]
*  I certainly didn't betray his base. It's funny. We I followed the party gait scandals very closely here including through your podcast [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3338.0s)]
*  But at the same time I think to myself, you know, donald trump hosted the republican national convention at the white house during covid [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3344.48s)]
*  So everything he does is just as venal and terrible and you know stupid but it's just out in public and somehow he's forgiven [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3351.36s)]
*  Um, so in the book, uh, you know, I i've read the excerpt. I purchased it today. I'm very excited to read it [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3358.0800000000004s)]
*  but it seems like a lot of the reviews in the coverage so far is [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3364.2400000000002s)]
*  It doesn't seem to paint the most hopeful view of government or at least your experience of government a few examples [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3367.84s)]
*  And correct me if I get anything wrong here [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3373.52s)]
*  It sounds like you were assigned your first ministerial job with basically no heads up or time to prepare and then [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3374.88s)]
*  Immediately driven to the office to meet your staff who also had no time to prepare [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3381.98s)]
*  It sounds like david cameron could be at times uninterested in policy and maybe a little bit oblivious to political threats like populism [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3387.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh parliament sounds like it's a lot like the u.s. Congress full of kind of phony dishonest people one of whom threatened to punch you [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3395.6800000000003s)]
*  Um, so, you know is your theory of the case here that look we gotta [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3403.6000000000004s)]
*  Get this all out there sunlight. This is the best disinfectant and then we can fix things [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3407.92s)]
*  But first I gotta tell the truth about how bad it really is. Yes, I I believe strongly that [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3412.1600000000003s)]
*  You don't fix things by covering things up [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3418.4s)]
*  You fix things by being brutally honest about the problems and then challenging people to come with you and fix them [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3420.96s)]
*  And in the uk context the problem is there is far too much power held in the center and these is basically we're being run [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3427.2799999999997s)]
*  By a 19th century parliamentary system [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3435.2799999999997s)]
*  And I think it's probably true to some extent of the u.s. Too that these are old-fashioned constitutions [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3438.48s)]
*  Created a very long time ago in a world before we had a fully educated [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3444.4s)]
*  Mobilized population. We've now got a very educated populations who are immensely capable [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3449.7599999999998s)]
*  Immensely empowered by social media and the idea that [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3455.44s)]
*  A few women and men stuck in some capital city [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3459.76s)]
*  Somehow are going to be able to have the knowledge [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3463.36s)]
*  The power the legitimacy to run people's lives in the way that we did in the past is just for the birds [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3466.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, i'm increasingly [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3472.4s)]
*  A believer in much more radical decentralization. I think governments [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3474.88s)]
*  Certainly in the uk and europe have have proven that [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3480.4s)]
*  that [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3484.88s)]
*  Get out of touch so quickly. I mean it's uh [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3486.0s)]
*  it's almost impossible to avoid the sense that you end up with [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3489.36s)]
*  Some very bright people i'm not saying there aren't very bright people. I mean you represent one of those people, but I think [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3493.76s)]
*  You probably will recognize that I I saw it maybe most dramatically [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3499.92s)]
*  In iraq and afghanistan. I I saw there [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3505.04s)]
*  some very bright capable people doing some very very foolish things and [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3508.08s)]
*  I'm afraid that what there were deeper lessons from the way we screwed up iraq and afghanistan [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3513.04s)]
*  Which actually apply to the way we run our own countries. That's right. Um, I noticed that [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3517.44s)]
*  Uh prime minister rishi sunak is not coming to the un general assembly this year nor are a bunch of other leaders [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3522.2400000000002s)]
*  Here's what you make of sunek's skipping of the of unga at a time when there are some questions about you know [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3528.4s)]
*  The uk's global influence post brexit is this too many summits in a row. Is this something deeper? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3534.0800000000004s)]
*  What do you make of it? I think it's very very sad [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3539.8399999999997s)]
*  Um the you know, i'm i'm speaking to you from new york. I've been doing all the normal round of meetings [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3542.96s)]
*  I've been doing stuff with usaid. I've just been with the president of malawi the the point about these things is not just [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3548.3199999999997s)]
*  Demonstrating that you care about the united nations the multilateral system and my goodness [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3556.22s)]
*  There are reasons to care about it particularly now because we're not going to fix climate change or deal with ai regulation adequately [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3560.08s)]
*  Without getting the world together and agreeing [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3566.96s)]
*  But it's also just a a much more efficient way of world leaders meeting each other [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3569.68s)]
*  Now one of the great reasons that we all come here is that we can in a day meet 14 15 [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3574.64s)]
*  People who we'd otherwise have to fly to 14 15 countries to meet so [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3580.56s)]
*  I'm very disappointed rishi sunak isn't here and I think it represents a real lack of ambition and vision from the british government [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3584.3199999999997s)]
*  Um, you know one of the things I know you've been doing on the margins of this of the un general assembly is [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3590.56s)]
*  Talking to people about the the excellent non-profit you work with give directly [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3595.6s)]
*  We were emailing last week about some of the work give directly has been doing in morocco [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3600.16s)]
*  It seems like the general theory of the case and correct me if i'm wrong is that people in extreme poverty or those recovering from a disaster [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3604.72s)]
*  They don't need [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3610.7999999999997s)]
*  Some guy like me in los angeles to send blankets. They need cash to buy whatever they think they need at that moment [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3612.16s)]
*  Um, but how does give directly? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3617.68s)]
*  Find people in rural morocco or eastern libya and connect with them and inform them about this program and this opportunity [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3620.24s)]
*  Well firstly, thank you tommy and thank you for raising it and thank you for your actually providing your personal support to to [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3627.7599999999998s)]
*  People in morocco who are as as you said when we were talking last week in the most desperate situation [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3634.88s)]
*  I mean, it's unimaginable [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3640.56s)]
*  I was in southeast turkey after the [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3642.7999999999997s)]
*  Earthquake and they're trying to come to terms with 42 000 people killed in about two minutes [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3645.8199999999997s)]
*  It's unimaginable or talking to friends [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3651.6s)]
*  Yeah, friends in marrakech and the sense of the aftershocks the sense that nobody [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3653.68s)]
*  It's not just the trauma of the loss of seeing your [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3658.48s)]
*  Friends and relatives killed. It's it's the sense that the aftershocks continue to haunt you [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3661.6s)]
*  So I think that's the first thing that thank you for raising this issue because it is so important that we we remain engaged with these things [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3666.64s)]
*  um secondly, I [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3674.96s)]
*  Thank you for pointing out that actually often if you've been through a terrible disaster [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3676.64s)]
*  The most useful thing you can do is be given cash. It's very difficult for you or me to work out [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3681.8399999999997s)]
*  Whether it's actually impossible for you or me to work out whether somebody whose entire [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3687.68s)]
*  Building has been destroyed by an earthquake what it is. They need [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3692.8799999999997s)]
*  the temptation is you know, you put a bunch of clothes in a van and you [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3696.56s)]
*  Send it off or you send food but actually [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3700.48s)]
*  What happens is the food arrives? I mean, maybe you send maize from idaho it arrives and the [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3703.6s)]
*  The recipient sells that in order to get cash to buy what they actually need which might be a tent over their head [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3708.4s)]
*  Or they might need to get their kids back in the school or a family [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3713.5200000000004s)]
*  Member may have a medical emergency or their business may be collapsing. So the best way that you can respond to these very [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3716.7200000000003s)]
*  Different individual needs is to get them cash and and how do we target? Well [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3723.92s)]
*  Give directly has been working in morocco for many years. We've got staff on the ground [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3728.32s)]
*  with specialists in delivering cash and and so [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3732.88s)]
*  For better or for worse we found ourselves in the epicenter of a crisis where we had some very experienced staff [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3736.88s)]
*  with the communities and we we do it through conducting needs assessments, I mean in the same way that [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3742.96s)]
*  UN agencies do and I think we're all getting better at it in learning [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3748.32s)]
*  How do I identify the people who are at most need and addressing them first? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3751.6s)]
*  So you're basically seeking them out [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3754.88s)]
*  You're going to the high ls mountains where there was some of the worst devastation and just finding people and saying hey this this program [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3756.32s)]
*  Exists we can get you cash [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3762.08s)]
*  We are doing it in different geographical areas, but the the basic approach is to to make sure that people are in [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3763.2s)]
*  Genuinely need that assistance and that isn't just people in the high atlases mountains [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3769.7599999999998s)]
*  There are people right around the edge of marrakech who are in [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3773.9199999999996s)]
*  Terrible need of assistance, but our driving principle [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3776.72s)]
*  Is to make sure that we do proper assessments and that's both [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3779.9199999999996s)]
*  Asking people questions about their incomes and their family [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3783.52s)]
*  But also just looking at the conditions in which they're living and putting those things together [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3786.0s)]
*  To make often quite a quick decision because we've got to get the money out quickly [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3789.76s)]
*  On who seems to be in real need. Yeah, so, you know, there's all these [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3793.6000000000004s)]
*  Huge global problems that are leading to extreme poverty. There's climate change. There's conflicts. There's covid [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3798.32s)]
*  Sometimes the international community steps up to tackle them [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3805.6800000000003s)]
*  More often recently it feels like [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3810.0800000000004s)]
*  big promises on climate change, for example [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3812.6400000000003s)]
*  Get forgotten when you know, russia invades ukraine and the price of gas goes up and everyone's worried about sort of the near-term [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3815.6000000000004s)]
*  political considerations [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3822.5600000000004s)]
*  What role do you think? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3824.2400000000002s)]
*  Nonprofits and ngo's like yours play [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3826.3s)]
*  At a time when there's this broader political dysfunction not just in capitals, but also at the un which you know [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3829.76s)]
*  Hasn't been able to get a lot done these days. I think the the major thing that we can do is to provide hope [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3836.5600000000004s)]
*  And you're absolutely right people are turning away from extreme poverty [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3842.4s)]
*  You remember we remember back in the 90s and 2000s [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3846.64s)]
*  We were going to make poverty history the sustainable development goal number one of the un was going to be to [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3849.44s)]
*  end extreme poverty by 2030 and the truth of the matter is [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3854.88s)]
*  That we've gone from 170 million people living in extreme poverty in sub-saharan africa in 1980 [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3858.4s)]
*  to 470 million people living in extreme poverty there today [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3864.08s)]
*  and [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3869.12s)]
*  There are many things that have gone wrong along the way [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3870.64s)]
*  Many of the things that actually drove those movements in the 90s and 2000s are less strong [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3874.08s)]
*  Churches are less strong trade union movements are less strong international solidarity is less strong [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3878.3199999999997s)]
*  It's interesting also there's been a change in celebrity culture. It's more and more difficult to get [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3883.68s)]
*  Famous people to actually endorse campaigns on poverty because they're worried about being accused of being hypocrites and being marginalized [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3888.64s)]
*  Music culture has changed [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3895.12s)]
*  But the biggest problem is that people have lost hope they think there's no solutions out there that the whole thing's a waste of time [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3897.04s)]
*  There's no point giving international aid. Nothing's going to get better [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3902.96s)]
*  So from give directly's point of view we are there to say there have been over [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3906.0s)]
*  350 academic papers studying [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3911.5s)]
*  Giving cash and it demonstrates through [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3914.96s)]
*  comparing [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3918.62s)]
*  Very scientifically with university partners what happens if you give cash compared to other interventions [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3919.92s)]
*  That cash can have a miraculous [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3924.96s)]
*  Transformatory impact on poverty that there is a solution that there's a way of putting [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3927.1s)]
*  the tens of billions of dollars [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3933.04s)]

*  I don't know fight those political fights and win them and help people understand that it's in our interests [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3992.0s)]
*  To help people overseas that this is not money that's getting exploited in some way. I think it's it's difficult [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=3996.8s)]
*  I mean if there was an easy answer, we'd all be driving up our aid budgets [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4001.76s)]
*  I mean [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4006.2400000000002s)]
*  Tommy you'll know yourself that one thing to do is to remind people that there's a degree of self-interest here that [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4008.4799999999996s)]
*  if africa finds itself in [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4014.72s)]

*  I mean look at it on the bright side [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4046.0s)]

*  Lose and I think this is sometimes I think politicians are a little cowardly about this. You cannot lose the ethical argument, too [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4074.56s)]
*  The truth of the matter is you have to be able to say [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4081.28s)]
*  In the end it is not just that you and I live in these very comfortable positions and that we can do [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4084.4s)]
*  Things to help people who are on this edge of starvation and we're not doing it [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4091.52s)]
*  I mean there was actually a I I saw him an american politician that I admired [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4094.96s)]
*  Being confronted with this and he said [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4100.4s)]
*  Somebody said to him but aren't people in america suffering and he said yeah [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4104.08s)]
*  people in america are suffering but [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4107.92s)]
*  People in malawi people in rwanda [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4110.08s)]
*  Are suffering far far more at a level that we can't begin to imagine [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4112.56s)]
*  And we got to do our bit to help them too [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4116.88s)]
*  Um, so I want to talk about the podcast before we before we wrap I love the show because you uh and your co-host alistair campbell who? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4119.04s)]
*  Is a top aid to to tony blair and the labor party our listeners might think of like a david axelrod in the uk [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4125.76s)]
*  Um, you guys talk a lot about foreign policy and I really appreciate that [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4131.52s)]
*  I really appreciate that. Uh, you did a two episode series on the iraq war that I thought was particularly riveting [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4134.719999999999s)]
*  Uh, you argued I thought convincingly that the war was a disaster [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4142.48s)]
*  I think that's sort of a fact at this point. I think alistair's position was more, you know, the intelligence at the time was dire [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4147.04s)]
*  We don't know how bad saddam hussein could have been if left in charge. I hope i'm characterizing it fairly [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4153.04s)]
*  It got a little heated [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4159.28s)]
*  Do you guys ever need to like uh pause the zoom walk away mute things during tapings to cool off or how does that go? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4160.32s)]
*  Well, I think we should we should be sharing podcast therapy. I don't know how this how this happens with your podcasting partner [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4166.08s)]
*  No, there's definitely times like that. I mean, you know, I was um, i'm here at the un general assembly [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4171.44s)]
*  So i'm running between all these different meetings and I did a podcast with alistair this morning [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4175.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was in real trouble because I suddenly dropped in at two hours notice [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4180.08s)]
*  I think we really need to discuss the un [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4183.599999999999s)]
*  And he was like we've been planning this podcast for weeks. How can you do this to me? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4186.320000000001s)]
*  I've got no time to prepare and he came on and he was really grumpy [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4190.56s)]
*  And I was very worried for the first 10 minutes. This is going to be terrible [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4194.0s)]
*  I mean, he seems so angry with me. I don't know how we're going to make it through this [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4197.200000000001s)]
*  Somehow he kind of perked up but yeah, it's it's an issue. Maybe you two though are [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4200.160000000001s)]
*  Are more chilled individuals. Maybe you don't get drawn into that that horror. Oh, no it happens [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4205.200000000001s)]
*  I mean ben and I just kind of we do our thing and we're fine on pots of america the [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4210.8s)]
*  The the politics show, you know, we've been doing this when you're sharing a microphone an office and a company for six years [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4214.88s)]
*  You know things get heated and you yell it out and come back [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4220.72s)]
*  But it's it's a fun show because look I think um, if I were to criticize some of my shows here at crooked media [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4223.360000000001s)]
*  It's that there's too often. Um [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4230.240000000001s)]
*  Uh rampant agreement, uh, and I like the fact that you guys mix it up [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4232.8s)]
*  I like that I can hear when alistair's pissed off. It means he's passionate about something. I think there's there's value to that [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4235.92s)]
*  Um, it's it's riveting listening for a variety of reasons and you know, I appreciate it [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4241.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, well, tell me thank you [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4246.48s)]
*  and I hope you enjoy how not to be a politician because I I hope the book you know, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4247.5199999999995s)]
*  it's a funny thing to do to a u.s audience because of course it's [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4252.32s)]
*  It's nine and a half years of painful experience of fighting bureaucracy fighting populism in britain [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4255.599999999999s)]
*  but I sometimes think that looking at [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4260.72s)]
*  An issue like populism from another angle looking at donald trump through the spectrum of boris johnson [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4263.92s)]
*  Can be helpful because it it helps us all think together about [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4269.68s)]
*  What the solutions can be how we can provide? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4273.44s)]
*  a genuinely inspiring [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4276.72s)]
*  emotional [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4279.74s)]
*  Logical vision of a better future that doesn't fall into just defending the past [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4280.96s)]
*  No, I think that's right and I think it is important to to see similar problems in different systems because in the u.s [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4285.44s)]
*  I think look there's a lot of problems with the two-party system. There's a lot of problems with the electoral college [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4292.08s)]
*  There's a lot of you know, gerrymandering [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4296.8s)]
*  There's a lot of structural challenges that we have but it's important to note [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4298.4800000000005s)]
*  That a parliamentary system is dealing with a lot of the same exact kind of buffoonish figures who are [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4302.400000000001s)]
*  You know making the same arguments and then germany with the afd sweden finland [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4307.84s)]
*  I mean, it's terrifying the spread of right-wing populism across europe. I mean, I think and and [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4312.320000000001s)]
*  A lot of that is driven by social media, but I think ai [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4317.280000000001s)]
*  Is going to have a a very dramatic effect on the next u.s election and I think it's just going to give [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4321.12s)]
*  Much more power to these forces all over the world. Yeah, we're we're [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4326.8s)]
*  For the russians, I think it feels like a binary [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4330.56s)]
*  Choice between trump who will cut off assistance ukraine and biden who will not so i'm we're very worried about ai and electoral interference going forward [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nhyeNAR5kI&t=4333.12s)]
