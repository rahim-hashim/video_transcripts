# Trump Encourages Russia to 'Do Whatever The Hell They Want' to NATO Nations
**Pod Save the World:** [February 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4)
*  Welcome to Pod Save the World. I'm Tommy Vitor. I'm Max Fisher Tommy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=0.0s)]
*  What a pleasure to be back with you is wonderful to see you Ben is traveling today [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2.96s)]
*  So we are thrilled and lucky to have you with us [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=6.42s)]
*  Well, I had great to be back with my Pod Save the World pals many people are saying it is more [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=9.24s)]
*  Triumphant of a return than John Stewart's return to the Daily Show [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  That's the scuttlebutt. Did you did you watch it? I did I watched this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=18.76s)]
*  there's like an eight-minute clip going around about Biden's age and Trump's age and how [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=22.96s)]
*  Poorly some of the responses has been have been from the from the left online. It's worth watching. I [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=28.28s)]
*  You know, everyone says it's so good [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=34.72s)]
*  I'm sure I'll cave and watch it eventually [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=36.52s)]
*  But I can't bring myself to watch it because I already feel like I'm being forcibly made to relive [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=37.88s)]
*  2016 you are so the right way I am. Yeah, so the idea of like throwing on John Stewart and also reliving 2008 [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=43.6s)]
*  It's like it's too much. That's a fair point. I'll be honest Max. I was very skeptical about it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  But [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=54.44s)]
*  It's hard to go back home. It's hard to go back to a place in time [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=55.64s)]
*  Simpler time. I didn't know Stuart was gonna but he slid right back into it. It was fun to watch [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=59.64s)]
*  But we have a great great show for you today much like John Stewart [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=65.0s)]
*  We're gonna talk about the increasingly acrimonious fight between President Biden Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=68.32s)]
*  Over Gaza, especially Israel's plan to invade the city of Rafa, which would be a disaster [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  We're also gonna cover the shift in Biden's tone when talking about Gaza [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=79.16s)]
*  We are gonna talk about how seriously to take Trump's attacks on NATO rhetorical attacks [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=82.08s)]
*  We're gonna briefly recap Tucker's very lame Putin interview talk about the ongoing fight in Congress over spending for Ukraine and Israel [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=91.72s)]
*  Pakistan had a shocking election outcome. That is a good a lot of ink here. Really really threw me. Yeah me too [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=99.76s)]
*  Genuinely shocking and then we'll talk about Irish unification in King Charles's views on modern medicine [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=106.24s)]
*  And then you're gonna hear Ben's interview with Congressman Andy Kim who is now running for the US Senate in New Jersey's running as Bob [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=111.88s)]
*  Menendez hopefully fingers crossed [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=118.6s)]
*  They talked about how corruption [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=120.88s)]
*  Changes the US government how it translates to our foreign policy and our credibility abroad a quick note Ben recorded this with Andy Kim last week [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=123.32s)]
*  So as before the latest round of voting on the supplemental bill for aid for Ukraine [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=130.92s)]
*  So if things sound a little dated just in terms of the tenses about the votes [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=134.54s)]
*  That is why wait Bob Menendez carrying gold bars from the Egyptian government in his jacket is bad for us credibility [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=137.7s)]
*  What when you say it like that Max it really is hard to believe that actually happened [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=144.1s)]
*  Okay, let's turn to Gaza because it is very clear that Biden's frustration with Netanyahu is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=150.1s)]
*  Deeply held at this point [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  It's spilling it to public and is happening as the Israeli military prepares to launch a new assault into the southern city of Rafa [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=158.06s)]
*  Here's a clip from President Biden last week at a press conference about his retention of classified documents [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=164.32s)]
*  I'm of the view as you know that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  the conduct of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=174.16s)]
*  the response [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=176.68s)]
*  In Gaza in the Gaza Strip has been [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=179.0s)]
*  Over the top [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  I've been pushing really hard really hard to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=186.44s)]
*  There are a lot of innocent people who are starving a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying and it's got to stop [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=192.36s)]
*  Over the top also at 80s movie, but arm-wrestling. I believe anyway [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=199.52s)]
*  Glad to hear him say something publicly about Netanyahu [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=204.68s)]
*  So Biden is reportedly mad that Netanyahu keeps rejecting ceasefire deals negotiated by the US and he feels that Israel has not done enough to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=206.88s)]
*  limit civilian casualties [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=213.96s)]
*  Before the war this brings us to Rafa before the war about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=215.72s)]
*  280,000 people lived in Rafa now [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  There's an estimated 1.4 million people sheltering there Netanyahu says they have to go into Rafa [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  It's impossible to win the war against Hamas without doing so because there's a bunch of Hamas fighters in Rafa [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=225.9s)]
*  They also claim that Israel's working on a plan to evacuate civilians [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  But pretty much everyone involved believes that invading Rafa would have disastrous humanitarian consequences to spell out some of those consequences [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=234.22000000000003s)]
*  We talked with Melanie Ward from medical aid for Palestinians about the humanitarian situation on the ground [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  The most crowded place on earth at the moment is probably Rafa where as you say over a million people are trying to seek shelter [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=246.78s)]
*  So the idea that a huge military assault will be allowed to take place on such an overcrowded place where people have nowhere to run [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=253.98s)]
*  Is beyond comprehension [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=262.46s)]
*  It's not just the scale of the human casualty and the bloodshed that would take place because of the sheer overcrowding [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=265.02s)]
*  It's also the fact that all of the aid that's been getting into Gaza almost all of it has been coming through Rafa [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  My organization has delivered [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=277.68s)]
*  huge amounts [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  of medical supplies [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=281.36s)]
*  Although again a drop in the ocean compared to what's needed since this started [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=282.72s)]
*  Almost all of it's coming through Rafa if we cannot supply the hospitals in the middle of such a bloody attack [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about tens of thousands of people who will be who will be needlessly killed. So the prospect is terrifying [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=292.72s)]
*  And Rafa itself right now [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  Huge overcrowding there isn't proper shelter [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  One of the things that israel has denied entry to in some cases are the tent poles for tents as you know [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=304.0s)]
*  The majority of housing has been destroyed now [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=310.56s)]
*  We can't even build proper tents because they won't allow tent poles in so people are constructing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  Whatever they can in the street flimsy pieces of nylon on bits of wood [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=318.0s)]
*  all over the streets [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=322.56s)]
*  And to try to have some kind of shelter, but it's obviously been raining as well [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=324.08s)]
*  There is no proper sewage system. There isn't enough fuel to run sewage systems [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=328.56s)]
*  One of the things that's happened is that israel has systematically targeted solar panels [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  There were quite a lot of those which ran water pump sewage systems. A lot of those have been taken out of action as well [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=337.44s)]
*  So the smell that there is just because of the sheer numbers of people and the waste that exists is is vast [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=343.84s)]
*  So max the u.s [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=350.24s)]
*  Says the we will oppose any military operation into rafa with that incredible plan in place to evacuate civilians [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=351.36s)]
*  Officials of the un say they oppose any military campaign in rafa and will quote not be a party to force [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=357.76s)]
*  Displacement of people so they're not going to help israel evacuate [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=363.82s)]
*  There were even reports that egypt had threatened to avoid its peace deal with israel over the rafa invasion [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=366.8s)]
*  But that seems like that had been walked back [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=370.88s)]
*  I'm just trying to see a path forward here where israel [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=373.52s)]
*  Goes through with this given all these concerns the international community i'm like [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=377.12s)]
*  How do you square the circle here of of the netanyahu's insistence that they go in with everyone else saying absolutely not [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=388.48s)]
*  So, I mean the the u.s [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=389.6s)]
*  And the un secretary general and the icc all giving the clearest possible red light [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=391.44s)]
*  Yeah a couple of months ago [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=396.4s)]
*  I would have said that's a really big deal because it's you know the clarity of it the fact that they're saying it publicly [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  But the thing is is that at this point the u.s has so many times [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=403.68s)]
*  Signaled or overtly said we don't want you to do this and then israel has done it or said we want you to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=407.74s)]
*  Do more to protect civilians and then has been ignored that the u.s has kind of painted itself into this corner where it's now [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=413.04s)]
*  Just proving to israel that there are no consequences for defying it and because they've kind of inched through defying [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  Or subtly defined the u.s so many times that we've really shown them that there are no cost to just write [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=426.32s)]
*  Us off and the fact that we've taken this stand so publicly now [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=433.12s)]
*  We're kind of putting what remains what little remains of our credibility with the israelis that they will ever listen to us [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=436.88s)]
*  On the line and at this point if we issue this warning and they divide defy it as they seem intent on doing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=444.0s)]
*  Um, there has to be some kind of action backing it up or we will clearly [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=450.88s)]
*  Have just proven to them once and for all you could ignore us do whatever you want and you will just get unlimited aid from us [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=455.44s)]
*  Yeah, I want to talk about that aid in a minute because you're right [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=461.84s)]
*  I mean steam throwing steam rolling through the senate as we speak. Um, meanwhile the cia director bill burns [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=463.76s)]
*  He's back in egypt as we speak. He's working to negotiate another ceasefire deal [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=469.2s)]
*  Biden talked about that ceasefire deal and the rafa his concerns about rafa during a meeting with king [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  King abdullah of jordan at the white house on monday. Um, but this broader set of concerns [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=478.4s)]
*  About israel and civilian casualties in gaza. It's not new [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=483.68s)]
*  Um prime minister bibi and yahoo got asked about israel's [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=488.56s)]
*  Uh lack of concern seemingly with civilian casualties on abc news over the weekend [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=492.8s)]
*  Here's a clip i'd be cautious with the khamas statistics and I can tell you that [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  according to these [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=502.88000000000005s)]
*  Urban warfare experts and other commentators. Uh, we've brought down the civilian to terrorist casualties the ratio down below one to one [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=504.24s)]
*  which is uh [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=512.72s)]
*  Considerably less than in any other theater of similar [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=513.98s)]
*  Warfare and we're going to do more. We're going to wait a minute [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=517.1s)]
*  You're saying it's only been one civilian that's been killed for one hamas terrorist [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=519.66s)]
*  in gaza [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=524.38s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly what i'm saying. Yes, we've killed uh, uh [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=525.82s)]
*  We've killed and wounded over 20 000, uh, uh hamas terrorists out of that about 12 000, uh, uh 12 000, uh fighters [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=529.98s)]
*  And we're doing everything we can to minimize civilian casualties and continue to do so [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=538.0600000000001s)]
*  So I find that very hard to believe [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=542.62s)]
*  Um, I guess we need to know how israel defines a hamas terrorist. I mean is it just any male of a certain age? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=545.58s)]
*  What did you make of that? It's also not a plausible claim because they are not on the ground counting casualty, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=551.26s)]
*  So it's clearly they're just making this up for publicity. Um, I I think it's it's worth [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=556.62s)]
*  Tommy kind of underscoring why everybody is so worked up about rafa [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=561.66s)]
*  Specifically like what we've heard about so many places where there are high rates of civilian casualties so many places with this humanitarian disaster [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=565.96s)]
*  but like rafa really is different because um [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=572.14s)]
*  It's I mean first of all, it's the sheer number of people there [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=576.78s)]
*  But it's also you have to understand why they're there why they're in rafa because of course israel invaded the north of gaza [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=579.5799999999999s)]
*  So it led to this huge displacement [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=585.02s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands people fled their home and they ended up in rafa, which is the southernmost point of gaza [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=587.18s)]
*  Squished right up against the border with egypt. So it's number one [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=593.0999999999999s)]
*  It's already in a state of humanitarian crisis even without an israeli [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=597.66s)]
*  Invasion of rafa where there's food shortages. There's an enormous health crisis there. And so any kind of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=601.66s)]
*  Bombing or intervention there is going to be way costlier and way more damaging and way deadlier than in other places [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=610.3s)]
*  And the other reason people are freaked out about this and you alluded to this when you mentioned egypt [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=616.4599999999999s)]
*  Is that because it's right up against this border crossing with egypt? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=620.9399999999999s)]
*  the big fear is that netanyahu is going to try to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=625.42s)]
*  Use some sort of humanitarian disaster in rafa to force a huge number of gossens across the border into egypt [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=629.58s)]
*  Which is something he's been talking about trying to do for a long time [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=635.9s)]
*  And if he does that that would be or could be the start of what a lot of people have considered the worst case outcome [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=639.9s)]
*  The great big nightmare scenario, which is permanent forced population transfer of gossens out of gaza into egypt to just say [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=646.3000000000001s)]
*  We're going to permanently remove a huge part of this population which you've been hearing every arab leader say is unacceptable [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  Since the very beginning but yeah, you're to your point [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=659.9799999999999s)]
*  I mean these are people who are the the population has grown five x since the before the war [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=662.06s)]
*  These are people who are not sheltering in buildings that provide a modicum of support if they're trapped. You're in a tent. Yeah [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=668.3s)]
*  Your options now to be moved are to go south into egypt, which is a non-starter for the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=675.02s)]
*  You can't because the egyptians are blocking it for the right people or you go into an area where [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=679.82s)]
*  There's a bunch of unexploded ordinance [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=684.38s)]
*  I mean, it's like these are bad bad bad options [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=686.94s)]
*  um also, I mean the new york times reported that u.s [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=690.14s)]
*  Intelligence believes that israel has degraded hamasis fighting capabilities, but is not even close to eliminating the group [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=693.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think last week we talked about how the united nations believes [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=700.22s)]
*  There's a hundred thousand people in gaza who are dead or missing and presumed dead [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=703.5s)]
*  The gaza health ministry has a number closer to 30 000 casualties that we know of but I just there's just no way that the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=709.1s)]
*  There's some sort of one-to-one ratio of dead fighters to dead civilians. It's just not possible, right and it's and [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=715.98s)]
*  It's it's only going to get worse as because the further the war goes on the more people [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=722.62s)]
*  Civilians I should say are concentrated into these areas where they're extremely vulnerable [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  So the war the more goes on the more it targets people who are more vulnerable [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=731.9000000000001s)]
*  And the higher the rates of civilian casualties are going to be and like you're saying hamasis at this point where [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=735.26s)]
*  You know, we're just talking about tunnels and we're just talking about like a bunch of guys who are hiding out in gaza [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=742.06s)]
*  Like it's not possible to eradicate this many needles in this big of a haystack. It's never going to happen [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=747.34s)]
*  So at some point you have to ask [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=753.42s)]
*  Why is this and I know you've been have discussed this i'm not the first one to raise this question [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=755.42s)]
*  But like why are we still doing this? Yeah, it's just um, it seems quite clear that the policy is not working [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=759.26s)]
*  It's not taking out hamasis. It's not getting the hostages back. It's not making anybody safer [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=764.7s)]
*  Yeah, and that's part of what really? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=768.54s)]
*  Frustrates me about how the the biden white house seems to have gotten to a point where they're saying okay [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=770.54s)]
*  We need to go public with this that we need to say no [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=774.62s)]
*  But because they have done so much kind of no saying up to this point, but then not followed through on it [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=777.5s)]
*  they've they've kind of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=783.74s)]
*  They flipped the effectiveness of it where now every time they say no [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=787.18s)]
*  It's actually actively detrimental to their goal of de-escalating because all it's doing is demonstrating the fact that israel has a blank check from us [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=791.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it seems like you know netanyahu believes [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=798.38s)]
*  That he needs to have this credible threat of more [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=801.66s)]
*  Harsher military intervention to get to a ceasefire deal [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=804.86s)]
*  But at the same time as rejecting all the ceasefire offers that come through [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=807.98s)]
*  Even if they're negotiated by bill burns and the cia and the masad director [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=811.98s)]
*  So I just don't know what the what the path forward is. Yeah, and it's the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=815.4200000000001s)]
*  The um, eu foreign policy chief joseph barrell [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=819.58s)]
*  Expressed I think the consternation that a lot of us feel when he expressed his outrage [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=824.14s)]
*  At joe biden specifically and said there's there's no point to keep saying, you know [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=830.14s)]
*  Oh, please please don't invade rafa. Don't do this if you're not also going to cut off arms transfers [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=836.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, let's listen to a clip of barrell's comments. How many times have you heard? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=841.4200000000001s)]
*  The most prominent leaders and foreign minister around the world saying too many people are being killed [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=846.8599999999999s)]
*  President biden said this is too much on the top [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=853.66s)]
*  Is not proportional [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=857.7399999999999s)]
*  Well, if you believe that too many people are being killed [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=859.8199999999999s)]
*  Maybe you should provide less arms [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  In order to prevent [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=867.18s)]
*  So many people being killed [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=869.18s)]
*  Is not logical [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=871.8199999999999s)]
*  Everybody goes to tel aviv begging. Please don't do that protect civilians. Don't kill so many [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=873.3399999999999s)]
*  But netanyahu doesn't listen anyone [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=881.0999999999999s)]
*  They're going to [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=884.3s)]
*  evacuate [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=885.8199999999999s)]
*  Where to the moon? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=887.42s)]
*  Where are they going to evacuate these people? So i'm not that familiar with barrell, but that's sounded pretty scathing [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=889.66s)]
*  It's pretty harsh yeah, and I think what's really striking is that he clearly has lost any faith whatsoever in [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=896.22s)]
*  Either the israeli leadership or in the us ability to have leverage with the israeli leadership [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=903.1s)]
*  And I think it's really striking that now he sees his role as targeting and pressuring washington [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=907.5s)]
*  Which does kind of feel like washington at this point is the last best chance to exert some sort of leverage on this [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=912.7800000000001s)]
*  I don't know if the u.s. Limiting arms transfers would actually change israeli policy. It's possible [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=918.86s)]
*  It wouldn't right, but it's what else are we going to do? That's what's frustrating [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=923.98s)]
*  We do have a lot of leverage, but that doesn't mean there's a guarantee that netanyahu would change course [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=927.9s)]
*  Beryl also pointed out that a court in the netherlands ordered the government to stop exporting parts for the f-35 to israel [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=932.78s)]
*  To ensure they're in compliance with the international court of justice's ruling and its implementation [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=939.02s)]
*  So I think that was an interesting flag by him to point out [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=943.9s)]
*  but you know, let's talk more about this this tonal change max because [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=947.26s)]
*  Last week members of biden's team including john finer the deputy national security advisor and samantha power the usaid administrator [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=950.54s)]
*  Went to michigan for meetings with members of the arab-american community who are angry about the administration's policy [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=957.3399999999999s)]
*  A recording of that meeting leaked out here's some some notable quotes [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=964.38s)]
*  So finer acknowledged a whole bunch of missteps and said quote [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=968.06s)]
*  We have left a very damaging impression based on what has been a wholly inadequate public accounting for how much the president [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=971.3399999999999s)]
*  The administration and the country values the lives of palestinians [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=976.54s)]
*  finer also talked about biden's efforts to push for the creation of a palestinian state but bluntly noted [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=980.14s)]
*  Quote I do not have any confidence in this current government of israel to implement that [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=985.42s)]
*  Um finer also said there was no excuse for releasing a white house state white house statement around the hundred day mark [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=990.2199999999999s)]
*  That didn't address or acknowledge the loss of palestinian life [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=995.9799999999999s)]
*  We also reached out to a guy named abbas al-awiyah [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=999.8199999999999s)]
*  Who attended this meeting to get his impression of the of the meeting of the conversation of what he heard from the biden administration officials [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1003.02s)]
*  Here's a clip in that meeting. We heard senior administration officials admitting that [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1009.5s)]
*  A lot of mistakes have been made. Um, but unfortunately a lot of the mistakes that they were talking about specifically pointing to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1015.34s)]
*  The 100 day statement for example the president biden issue that failed to mention [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1022.14s)]
*  um, uh, the loss of palestinian life a lot of the mistakes that they were pointing to were messaging mistakes and what we were [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1027.58s)]
*  Looking to hear from them is some level of commitment to a different approach on the policy side [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1036.38s)]
*  you know [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1044.14s)]
*  That meeting felt like it coincided with president biden [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1045.66s)]
*  um saying that maybe the israelis were that maybe the israeli military was was acting in a way that was over the top [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1049.8200000000002s)]
*  um [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1058.3000000000002s)]
*  You know in the meeting they were admitting two mistakes [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1059.42s)]
*  But you know, it feels like not even the bare minimum over the top would be if I asked someone how their day was [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1061.58s)]
*  And they accused me of you know, being too invasive and getting into their business [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1068.6999999999998s)]
*  I might say oh hey your response feels over the top over the top is not what we call [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1073.1799999999998s)]
*  the killing of 12 000 plus [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1078.78s)]
*  children [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1081.24s)]
*  Palestinian children in gaza using our tax dollars. That's not over the top what that [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1082.3s)]
*  Is according to the experts who study of this stuff is the mass [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1088.1399999999999s)]
*  The mass inflicting of of war crimes said it's they've dragged this [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1093.74s)]
*  This conflict into a genocidal place that ought to worry all of us and it is worrying voters here in michigan that biden [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1099.82s)]
*  Really needs if he's going to win the presidency [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1107.02s)]
*  So clearly the administration is a long way to go to assuage the policy concerns from the arab-american community in michigan [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1109.4199999999998s)]
*  I do think the white house got [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1115.74s)]
*  uh the message on tone and and [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1117.9s)]
*  Feelings, I think that the white house themselves says are understandable and and it were the result of mistakes that biden wasn't expressing [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1121.58s)]
*  enough [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1130.7s)]
*  Concern about the loss of palestinian life as compared to the loss of israeli life [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1131.82s)]
*  This is a clip from biden's statement. Uh when he did a [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1136.46s)]
*  Wasn't a press conference because they didn't take questions [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1141.5800000000002s)]
*  But a little statements to the press with king abdullah during his visit on monday the past four months [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1143.26s)]
*  As the war has raged the palestinian people have also suffered unimaginable pain and loss [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1148.7s)]
*  too many [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1154.8600000000001s)]
*  Too many of the over 27 000 palestinians killed in this conflict have been innocent civilians and children [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1156.06s)]
*  Including thousands of children and hundreds of thousands have no access to food water or other basic services [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1163.98s)]
*  Many families have lost not just one but many relatives [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1171.42s)]
*  Cannot mourn for them [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1175.42s)]
*  Even bury them because they're not safe to do so [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1177.5800000000002s)]
*  It's heartbreaking [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1181.66s)]
*  Every innocent life in gaza is a tragedy [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1183.66s)]
*  Just as every innocent life lost in israel is a tragedy as well [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1187.82s)]
*  So I mean definitely better [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1191.5s)]
*  I do wonder if that had been the tone from day one if it might have made a difference on the margins [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1192.7s)]
*  But that's what I was thinking is it like if this had been the shift that had come a month [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1196.22s)]
*  Into the conflict then I think I would be like, okay [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1200.94s)]
*  I understand that like this makes sense as a certain kind of like pace of evolution [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1204.3s)]
*  But the fact that it's four months in and the fact that this seems to be so far behind where [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1209.3400000000001s)]
*  Basically everybody else as far as I can tell in terms of allies in terms of opinion polling is on the conflict [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1214.46s)]
*  It's just it's it's baffling to me, honestly [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1219.98s)]
*  And it's also hard to me when it's paired with pushing hard for a supplemental that does not condition aid to israel [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1223.42s)]
*  When it's paired with pushing hard for normalizing relations between the saudis in israel like that [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1228.86s)]
*  It seems like they think that's the key to unlocking kind of the whole region [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1233.4199999999998s)]
*  Um the saudi thing feels like i've i'm sorry to fire off some strays here [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1238.3s)]
*  It feels like a weird brett magurk side project like zombie side project that like it's not clear to me [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1242.1399999999999s)]
*  Why they're continuing to pursue this and like I think brett magurk is a great guy and it's like [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1247.74s)]
*  Really intelligent and has done a lot of really good things in u.s [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1254.06s)]
*  Middle east policy, but it's very strange to me that he's continuing to push this [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1256.94s)]
*  Long after it was clear that it was ever going to happen or play any role in how the conflict exists [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1261.1000000000001s)]
*  You know today post october 7. Yeah [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1267.02s)]
*  So brett magurk is a is a administration staffer has worked for four different white houses in bipartisan ways [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1269.02s)]
*  He was a u.s ambassador to iraq under obama. He led the anti-isis coalition [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1275.26s)]
*  Efforts for the u.s government under obama and then stayed under trump now [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1280.8600000000001s)]
*  He's doing a lot of middle east peace work and I agree with you though [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1284.86s)]
*  I mean it does seem like so much time and focus and effort has been put into [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1287.9799999999998s)]
*  Extending the abraham accords normal normalizing relations between saudi arabia and the israeli government [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1292.2199999999998s)]
*  With I guess part of that process being some really concrete steps towards the israelis [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1298.3s)]
*  Allowing for the creation of a palestinian state [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1304.06s)]
*  but [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1306.6999999999998s)]
*  Who trusts this government this israeli government this israeli coalition? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1307.6599999999999s)]
*  To implement those changes or to do politically tough things clearly not john feiner the deputy national security advisor because he said as much [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1311.8999999999999s)]
*  This is what this is what is really confusing to me is that these are smart people at the ministries [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1319.1s)]
*  These are smart sensitive people. I mean sensitive not emotionally but like to the [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1324.6999999999998s)]
*  To what's going on in the middle east. I I believe that they do earnestly care about it [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1331.02s)]
*  I believe that they do earnestly want [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1335.5s)]
*  The best thing ultimately for both israelis and palestinians [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1337.9s)]
*  And it's just been very hard for me honestly to understand why [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1341.66s)]
*  These people who are so accomplished who know this region so well have seemed so consistently [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1345.9s)]
*  weeks or months behind [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1352.06s)]
*  understanding not just the mood around what's happening, but understanding the actual events on the ground and the kind of [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1354.36s)]
*  Machinations and movements. I mean the fact that it took us until now to get to hey [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1359.48s)]
*  Maybe it's time to publicly throw up a big red stop sign after they blew through it so many times privately before [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1363.9s)]
*  Honestly, I don't get it. I really feel like I can usually even when I disagree with policy [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1372.14s)]
*  I really feel like I can understand [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1376.22s)]
*  I see how they got here and it's just I can't make x and y connect on this one [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1377.74s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1382.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean biden's theory of the case in the early days was that he needed to hug netanyahu politically and disagree in private [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1383.1000000000001s)]
*  And that's how you got him to move sure after several months of that not working in in netanyahu [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1388.54s)]
*  In fact publicly rebuking you repeatedly. I would have changed course and you know what actually i'm glad you brought that up [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1393.5s)]
*  What blows my mind is that one of the architects actually arguably the architect of the hug bb strategy hillary clinton [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1399.3400000000001s)]
*  Who I mean she named that strategy and it came out in emails that were leaked by wiki leaks back in the day [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1405.98s)]
*  Talk about flashback to 2016 wiki leaks helping out reporters with background sources [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1413.66s)]
*  Decades, I really they saved me a lot of energy. Yeah, but she articulated this whole hug bb closer to try to get concession strategy [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1418.7s)]
*  you know [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1426.1399999999999s)]
*  Eight years ago, whatever it was and she came out recently and said we got to get netanyahu out of there [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1427.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he's part of the problem. You're never and I think she's right and I think some people in the administration [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1432.78s)]
*  I do get the sense agree with this that there's never going to be a solution to the ongoing conflict in gaza [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1437.1799999999998s)]
*  As long as he is in office now [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1442.46s)]
*  I don't know if israeli politics are up to that job, but there does seem to be movement around it [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1444.38s)]
*  yeah, you're right, I do want to do a little introspection on this tone question because [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1448.46s)]
*  I saw a friend the other day. I'm gonna fuzz up identities here to keep it vague [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1452.46s)]
*  who's basically like another mutual friend can no longer listen to [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1456.5400000000002s)]
*  Pazzei the world or you and ben because you guys are so [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1460.8600000000001s)]
*  Hard in israel and so biased against israel that is it is offensive to this person [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1463.66s)]
*  And it hit me hard because this is a person I know well, I care about a lot [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1469.1000000000001s)]
*  I really respect is just like incredibly smart thoughtful person [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1472.62s)]
*  And I do think you know just like stepping back [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1477.1s)]
*  It was a reminder that even though this war has been going on for months now and it feels like it's dragging on and becoming [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1479.02s)]
*  More painful when you look at the palestinian loss of life [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1485.8999999999999s)]
*  For israelis, I think they still feel like october 7th was yesterday. That wound is wide open has not begun to heal [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1489.4199999999998s)]
*  Especially with hostages still being held and I think for a lot of jews around the world [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1496.3799999999999s)]
*  They still feel threatened and scared by rising anti-semitism [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1500.78s)]
*  You have to acknowledge that you have to acknowledge how cruel and unfair it is that a lot of the people killed [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1505.66s)]
*  On october 7th were the most committed to peace and reconciliation [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1510.8600000000001s)]
*  They were like, you know lefties living on kibbutz in places [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1515.18s)]
*  Absolutely, and how hard it must be if you're an israeli where like 10 months ago you were on the streets [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1518.38s)]
*  protesting netanyahu for trying to shred [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1523.88s)]
*  Uh the judicial system now you're trapped with this guy like leading a war effort [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1526.7s)]
*  and so I think like for me at the end of the day, I think the only morally consistent position has to be that [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1532.38s)]
*  One life is worth the same amount as the other like palestinian or israeli. You can't [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1537.98s)]
*  You can't say that october 7th justifies any response [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1542.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because the other side will use that same logic [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1547.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1549.26s)]
*  And my greatest fear ultimately with this whole thing is that hamas is getting what they want here a wildly disproportionate response [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1549.9s)]
*  And it's another generation radicalized in the cycle of violence continuing [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1555.66s)]
*  It's always the extremists on both sides who feed into each other because they both need and want perpetual violence and perpetual distrust and hatred [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1558.86s)]
*  and you know, I I agree with you and I say the exact same thing to friends who are [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1567.5s)]
*  you know more on the lefty end who I feel like take things a little too far sometimes in terms of [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1573.98s)]
*  dehumanization of israelis or [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1579.56s)]
*  Talking about october 7th in a way that feels like it is, you know [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1581.8799999999999s)]
*  muddying responsibility for it or is you know doing some atrocity denial or is kind of like doing a little bit of [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1586.52s)]
*  Apologism for it truth. Isn't it? Right? Is that is that um [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1592.8999999999999s)]
*  every every life, I know it sounds like such a cliche when you say it, but [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1598.28s)]
*  everybody's life does matter and [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1603.3799999999999s)]
*  International rights and international laws apply to everyone they bind everyone and they protect everyone equally [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1605.96s)]
*  And if we believe in a world for israelis and palestinians [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1612.2s)]
*  Where one side is free from these kinds of threats both sides have to be free from it [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1616.04s)]
*  Yeah, and that is not to draw an equivalency between october 7th and what is happening because they are not equivalent [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1620.6000000000001s)]
*  but at the same time, I think you're [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1626.28s)]
*  I don't know faver and I talk about this a lot on offline talk about how [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1628.76s)]
*  It's kind of one thing to [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1633.0800000000002s)]
*  Take a morally clear and justified position which you know, you won't be surprised to hear [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1635.24s)]
*  I feel like you and ben do and you're very consistent and clear on it [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1640.28s)]
*  But at the same time even if you do that [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1643.4s)]
*  Your comments whether you want them to or not are going to land in a media environment in a discourse that is incredibly toxic [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1645.88s)]
*  and polarized and where there's a lot of dehumanization and hatred on both sides and [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1652.8400000000001s)]
*  That makes it tough because it makes it [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1657.56s)]
*  You can't always know how people are going to hear you even if you're clear on how you articulate yourself [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1659.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and that's a little self-awareness about one's own hypocrisy hypocrisy is probably good like for example [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1663.8s)]
*  uh, it is [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1670.6799999999998s)]
*  Notable and concerning to me that I think in the israeli [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1672.12s)]
*  Media, you don't hear a lot of stories about what's happening to people on the ground in gaza about civilian casualties, etc [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1675.6399999999999s)]
*  The support for the military campaign is horrific as it seems to us is overwhelmingly strong [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1682.36s)]
*  Then you have to remember [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1688.2s)]
*  six months after 9 11 [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1689.72s)]
*  abc news wasn't doing big stories about you know, civilian casualties in afghanistan necessarily [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1691.56s)]
*  For all of us all we were thinking about was revenge and vengeance and getting the bad guys, right? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1698.44s)]
*  And so i'm not saying that justifies either response [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1703.0s)]
*  In fact, like joe biden's initial message was let's learn from the mistakes of 9 11 [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1705.96s)]
*  That's something we talked about early on in the show [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1709.72s)]
*  But it is just sort of like trying to be empathetic put yourself in the shoes of both sides and right see where they're coming from [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1711.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, i've always tried to tell people you don't have to agree with or sympathize with people who you [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1717.88s)]
*  Disagree with on this conflict because if you feel very strongly about it as I do and I know you do [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1724.0400000000002s)]
*  you know, you're not going to like bend your moral principles on it just to make someone happy, but [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1729.88s)]
*  I think it is important to try to give people [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1735.5600000000002s)]
*  grace when you're talking to people in your lives about it because it's a you know, that's part of how we [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1738.5200000000002s)]
*  Help others in our life humanize people who they might not be [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1744.2800000000002s)]
*  Necessarily prone to humanizing as equally as other people is by just [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1750.26s)]
*  Listening to them and hearing them out and helping them feel, you know a little safer and expressing themselves [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1755.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, let's take a quick break and we come back. We're going to talk about president trump's efforts to shred nato [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1759.64s)]
*  Okay, we're back. So former president trump i need to say we're back. Okay former president trump [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1764.6000000000001s)]
*  Kicked up a very substantive very helpful debate about the future of nato at a recent campaign event in south carolina [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1769.96s)]
*  Here's a clip next if we don't pay and we're attacked by russia [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1776.68s)]
*  Will you protect us? No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1781.0s)]
*  You gotta pay so that was he was recounting a completely made up conversation [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1786.84s)]
*  He allegedly had with some european leader member of nato [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1790.84s)]
*  So again just real quick for the 100,000th time nato members don't pay dues to the organization [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1793.48s)]
*  None of these countries owe the u.s or nato money. We all agree [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1799.18s)]
*  You have to spend two percent of gdp on our own defense [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1802.46s)]
*  It's a target not an obligation by the way and the goal was supposed to be hit in 2024 in 2023 [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1804.94s)]
*  11 nato members hit the two percent spending target. That means 20 of them did not [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1810.22s)]
*  Poland which borders cleningrad and ukraine spent 3.9 percent of gdp on defense [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1815.5800000000002s)]
*  So clearly proximity to russia is a factor here the u.s spent nearly 3.5 percent of gdp on defense [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1820.7s)]
*  Which is a total of 860 billion dollars because we're also the largest economy in the world [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1826.22s)]
*  That is more than double all all other nato allies combined [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1830.7s)]
*  But clearly we don't put all those resources towards europe a lot of them are in the indo-pacific, etc [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1833.8200000000002s)]
*  We're pivoting to asia maxi. You might have heard that for the last decade. Yeah, so [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1838.38s)]
*  We're back [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1842.5400000000002s)]
*  At the you you you preview this entire episode perfectly. We're back in 2016 [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1843.9s)]
*  Uh at the age-old question. Do we take trump seriously or literally? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1848.46s)]
*  Clearly countries in europe are they're worried about these comments. What's your take? I think that that's exactly right. I think that the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1852.78s)]
*  What matters is how this is read in europe? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1860.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1863.34s)]
*  Not just because like we're tired of playing this game again of like was it bluster for a rally [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1864.3799999999999s)]
*  Is this actually a policy position? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1869.18s)]
*  But because specifically what he's talking about is the american defense commitment to europe that is all a matter of perception [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1870.78s)]
*  That's the reason that that matters [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1877.18s)]
*  Not because you want it to be tested because you don't want it to be tested because you everyone [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1878.86s)]
*  You want everyone to believe it's true? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1882.54s)]
*  so [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1884.3799999999999s)]
*  What matters is do european leaders think that he meant it or might mean it or could radicalize himself into meaning it? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1885.18s)]
*  or does moskow think that and [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1891.82s)]
*  You know european leaders have expressed you will be shocked to hear this [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1894.7s)]
*  Uh a lot of unhappiness with donald trump's claims about uh, whether or not he will defend europe from russia [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1898.62s)]
*  um, I have to say speaking of [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1905.26s)]
*  Deja vu to 2016 [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1907.98s)]
*  um, I spent a lot of time in european capitals in 2017 and 2018 like interviewing european leaders and they were all telling me they were like [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1910.0600000000002s)]
*  This is it. We've realized we can no longer rely on america. We had eight years of bush [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1917.8200000000002s)]
*  Now you've elected trump. We can't count on the u.s anymore. We're going to build a new independent european security order [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1922.22s)]
*  And you will be shocked to hear tommy. They did not do that [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1928.94s)]
*  And I think that they right they wanted to and there were all of these plans for like a german [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1931.98s)]
*  french alliance that was going to lead europe and it's just hard and they were just not able to do it expensive [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1937.26s)]
*  It's expensive and they're just you know, what what one german defense official said to me [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1942.78s)]
*  They were like look this is all we've ever known. We can't on a dime just completely change [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1947.02s)]
*  How we see ourselves in the global order they have started all spending a lot more in defense [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1951.98s)]
*  That's ironically more thanks to flatimer putin than it is to donald trump, right? Yeah [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1956.38s)]
*  Um, I don't think that russia is going to invade europe because they heard donald trump say something wacky [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1960.3s)]
*  At a rally, but at the same time [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1966.38s)]
*  Like you know the danish intelligence service came out [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1969.5s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that came out a few days ago and they said we believe that within the next three to five years [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1972.14s)]
*  Russia will test the article 5 nato mutual self-defense commitment by attacking a nato member [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1977.02s)]
*  Maybe that's true or not true [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1982.7800000000002s)]
*  but [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1984.3000000000002s)]
*  if we all agree that russia attacking nato would be a horrible nightmare scenario because it at least in theory would trigger world war 3 [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1985.18s)]
*  Between the great nuclear powers, which is not a good outcome [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1993.26s)]
*  Then anything that makes that even one percent more likely like the potential future again return president [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=1996.94s)]
*  Saying i'm not going to uphold article 5 then even if we think that's not likely to move the needle very much [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2004.94s)]
*  That's still scary. I mean we're still debating in [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2011.58s)]
*  2022 23 24 I guess what jim baker? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2015.24s)]
*  Said to gorbachev in the 1990s about nato expansion. It's actually a great new book on this just came out [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2019.42s)]
*  Okay, great new book. I will read it and whether this communication led to uh the eventual invasion of ukraine [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2026.06s)]
*  I could imagine a scenario where trump is elected president [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2032.78s)]
*  Uh putin decides to invade some [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2036.7s)]
*  Smaller nato country that hadn't been paying its dues and his public statement is like you told me I could [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2039.58s)]
*  What does what does trump say back to that? Right? I mean that's the [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2044.94s)]
*  Especially because we know that putin's russia is irrational enough to have launched this ill-fated [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2048.3s)]
*  Ill-thought-out invasion of ukraine in the first place. We already know we're not deep dealing with a like super [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2055.74s)]
*  thoughtful like coldly rational power here, so between [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2063.0s)]
*  Trump's america and putin's russia. There is enough uncertainty here that you do worry about some scenario [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2068.3s)]
*  No, I don't think it'll happen in a vacuum [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2074.14s)]
*  I don't think we'll wake up one morning and find out that putin invaded latvia [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2075.66s)]
*  Sorry latvia because trump said they could but I think the the scenario that this makes me think of is if there is something [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2079.8199999999997s)]
*  That happens in two three four five years from now where there's some kind of crisis that [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2086.06s)]
*  Could lead to something like that where there's some you know [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2091.66s)]
*  Mistake along the border between nato countries and russia. There's some sort of set of provocations that build thing up that [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2094.8599999999997s)]
*  That could feed into the misperceptions where trump believes that he's getting a green light from the americans when he actually is not [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2102.78s)]
*  Which to take another famous historical example is there is a school of thought that that is why saddam hussein's iraq invaded kuwait [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2109.98s)]
*  Was because he wrongly believed that he had a green light from the americans. So these communications the nuances of them really matter [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2117.98s)]
*  They really do matter [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2124.3s)]
*  Regardless of what happens in the future if trump selected biden wants the political fight the biden white house does [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2125.98s)]
*  President biden went out and gave a statement about trump's comments earlier today, tuesday the 13th [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2130.8599999999997s)]
*  Here's a clip if an ally didn't spend enough money on defense [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2136.8599999999997s)]
*  He would encourage russia to quote do whatever the hell they want end of quote [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2140.3799999999997s)]
*  Can you imagine [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2145.8999999999996s)]
*  A former president of united states saying that [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2147.74s)]
*  The whole world heard it [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2150.7799999999997s)]
*  The worst thing is he means it [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2153.3399999999997s)]
*  No other president our history has ever bowed down to a russian dictator [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2155.74s)]
*  Well, let me say this as clearly as I can I never will [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2160.22s)]
*  For god's sake it's dumb. It's shameful. It's dangerous. It's unamerican [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2164.8599999999997s)]
*  When america gives us word it means something [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2170.3799999999997s)]
*  When we make a commitment we keep it [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2173.18s)]
*  And nato is a sacred commitment a sacred commitment sacred is that is it in the bible? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2175.5s)]
*  I don't know is it old testament or new testament that has the the nato charter in it. Maybe it's the mormon one [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2180.9399999999996s)]
*  I'm not sure more modern iteration an american religion. So that makes sense [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2185.8999999999996s)]
*  so [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2190.54s)]
*  I get the fight [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2192.7s)]
*  This fight distracts from the classified documents case, right? It's right them going on offense, right? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2194.14s)]
*  There's overwhelming support for nato in a recent pupil [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2199.58s)]
*  Americans overwhelmingly think russia is an enemy after the russian invasion and the context has entirely changed. I do worry about this [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2204.12s)]
*  Feeling like we're folding back into the very stupid 2016 2017 putin's puppet [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2211.98s)]
*  kind of resistance [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2218.14s)]
*  Nonsense, do you don't think that that was effective when the hillary clinton campaign ran on that? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2219.82s)]
*  I do not you don't think that that would do. I do not I don't know [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2224.3s)]
*  I don't want to make of it. I don't want to like deny reality and the fact that this is a bad [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2226.94s)]
*  Comments for trump to make no absolutely. I I as you're listening to the biden clip [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2230.54s)]
*  I was like I agree with him but like [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2234.6200000000003s)]
*  Who were the voters that we think are like voting on nato article five? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2237.42s)]
*  That weren't already going to vote against trump like this will this will play really well on massachusetts avenue for sure [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2241.6600000000003s)]
*  But it's not clear to me that how it's going to do in peoria [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2247.1s)]
*  Yeah, you have to make it a broader. I think kind of weakness argument, which he tries to do [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2249.5s)]
*  But I don't know. We'll see if how it plays out. Um speaking of putin so tucker carlson's interview with vladimir putin is now available [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2253.18s)]
*  Uh, it's on his website. I don't know why i'm advertising for the guy. So [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2260.22s)]
*  Unfortunately ben and I promised to check it out and get back to you guys [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2263.98s)]
*  Uh, it turns out we didn't watch the whole thing. We forced alona to [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2267.74s)]
*  Uh, it was incredibly boring. It was two hours long [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2271.98s)]
*  It started with a 30-minute monologue on russian history [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2274.54s)]
*  Tucker did ask putin about russia's detention of a wall street journal reporter named evan gershkovich [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2277.5s)]
*  Which I guess credit to him for doing the bare minimum. Yeah, but um, I know the best part [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2282.86s)]
*  Uh the president of mongolia used the conversation as a chance to troll putin by posting a map of the old mongolian empire [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2287.42s)]
*  Which included parts of modern-day russia the lesson being be careful about suggesting historical territorial claims are relevant [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2293.98s)]
*  Also that it's fun to look at maps and fun to look at old maps old maps are cool [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2300.7799999999997s)]
*  And then the editor of rt whined that putin and tucker didn't talk enough about putin's anti-woke crusades [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2304.46s)]
*  So, I don't know max. Do you put in an interview request to get over to moscow? I would love to interview putin [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2310.7s)]
*  Um, I so to me, I think the only thing that I felt like I really learned from this of any value [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2316.46s)]
*  which I will relay now to share people the uh, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2322.62s)]
*  Shame and horror of watching this. Yes, please do is um, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2326.62s)]
*  I thought it was a really striking to see tucker carlson trying to push putin so hard to validate the like [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2329.74s)]
*  tucker carlson kind of maga [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2337.66s)]
*  Narrative of the war which is that it was america's fault and the west fault because of nato because nato was bad [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2340.12s)]
*  So they forced putin to invade and tucker carlson tried so hard to tee that up for putin and he just wouldn't do it [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2346.14s)]
*  Because all he wanted to do was lecture tucker carlson for like 30 minutes [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2353.8999999999996s)]
*  About this byzantine and like frankly not interesting literally ancient russian history. It started 862 ad [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2358.94s)]
*  We're not kidding at all. Talk about talk about me late night at the bar [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2367.1s)]
*  Talking about rurik and the ancient ancient, uh kiev and russ. You're talking about a date with three digits boy. We got problems [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2371.5s)]
*  We got real problems [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2378.86s)]
*  um, but I I did think it was striking that putin got the chance to explain why he [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2380.38s)]
*  Launched this war and his explanation was just ultra-nationalism for the sake of your dentism [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2385.18s)]
*  That's that's what it is. And I think that a lot of us have thought that and I think it was reassuring [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2390.7s)]
*  Or it was it was helpful to get this reassurance that no nato didn't cause the war [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2396.46s)]
*  It wasn't america's fault that it was just hyper nationalist [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2400.7799999999997s)]
*  Weird mythology that he is using to justify a desire to grab territory from a foreign state, right? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2404.62s)]
*  And like again, I don't really care if tucker interviews laden with putin like have at it buddy [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2409.3399999999997s)]
*  But I did like how we tried to pre spin the criticism by saying [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2414.6200000000003s)]
*  He put in a request and no other western media outlets have and even that's not true putin spokesman was like no, man [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2419.1800000000003s)]
*  We say no to press requests all the time. Yeah, no, it's it's good to interview bad people [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2424.78s)]
*  Of course good you want to learn from them? We should talk to them. We should you know engage in diplomacy [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2429.42s)]
*  We should interview them kim jong-un. Come on offline. Yeah [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2433.6600000000003s)]
*  We should take them at their word. Uh, but a lot of this obviously the the fate of ukraine is tied up in [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2436.86s)]
*  This broader conversation we're having [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2441.5800000000004s)]
*  Uh, so just days after tanking their own immigration reform bill [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2443.18s)]
*  The senate then worked all weekend to pass a new supplemental funding bill that does include 60 billion for ukraine 14 billion for israel [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2447.4199999999996s)]
*  10 billion for humanitarian relief including some for gaza now [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2454.7799999999997s)]
*  the [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2458.22s)]
*  Next this thing goes to the house of representatives, right? So we got speaker johnson deciding what happens to ukraine [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2459.1s)]
*  Uh, he doesn't want to take up the bill because it's unpopular with mago republicans [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2465.18s)]
*  He thinks that it would lose him his job as speaker [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2468.8599999999997s)]
*  So the question is now whether a majority of house members can make an end run around him using a procedure called [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2471.5s)]
*  A discharge petition. We'll see if that happens [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2476.62s)]
*  But max once again trump decided to roll a grenade into this policy debate by announcing [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2479.3399999999997s)]
*  That all foreign policy aides should come in the form of loans and not grants not aid including aid to israel, by the way [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2485.3399999999997s)]
*  so lindsey graham who a republican senator from south carolina never met a war he didn't want to fund [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2491.98s)]
*  Is apparently dutifully following trump's lead on this matter and he said he will vote against ukraine funding unless it's in the form of a loan [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2498.06s)]
*  Uh max i'm sure this idea polls well, right? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2506.2999999999997s)]
*  Because people don't love foreign people and there's all of these polls of when there are these surveys where they will ask people [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2509.8199999999997s)]
*  How much do you how much of the federal budget do you think goes toward foreign aid and people will say oh 10 15? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2515.9s)]
*  I think we're tithing [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2522.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, um, but I mean I guess [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2524.2999999999997s)]
*  Look trump has a there's a history of him saying kind of crazy stuff and then it becomes a consensus [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2526.94s)]
*  What we're in position [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2531.34s)]
*  I mean, do you think like this is where we're heading is our our is all foreign aid in the form of a loan now [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2532.1400000000003s)]
*  And what do you think the impact of that would be it's always popular to [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2536.46s)]
*  For politicians to declare we're cutting foreign aid because like you say people overestimate how big it is and people don't [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2540.0600000000004s)]
*  Like it because the name is foreign aid so they think it's charity [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2546.1400000000003s)]
*  They think it's a giveaway and they say why are you giving away my tax dollars to a country that I don't care about and of course [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2548.78s)]
*  That's not what it is [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2554.54s)]
*  The reason that it exists is not for as much as I wish it were the case that we were a charitable nation [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2556.06s)]
*  Just giving out our riches to help people in need. It's because we get things in return for it [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2561.42s)]
*  and in the specific case of ukraine it's because [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2566.54s)]
*  Spending what is a relatively small amount of money to grind down the russian war machine in this [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2569.96s)]
*  Really really tough war of attrition in ukraine and to preserve what we can of ukrainian territorial integrity [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2576.7s)]
*  Is a huge upside and like it sounds crass to put it this way, but an incredible value proposition [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2583.98s)]
*  And um, I think you could you know question what value we're getting for aid to israel specifically [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2589.5s)]
*  I think that's a fair debate to have although not on the grounds that lindsey graham wants to have it [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2596.3s)]
*  But the idea when you are giving [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2600.7s)]
*  Money to countries like this is that they are doing something that is helpful to you [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2603.02s)]
*  That you were getting for cheaper than if you did it yourself or that you were not able to do it yourself [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2607.5s)]
*  Or you're trying to prop up a country that would otherwise collapse that would create a humanitarian crisis [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2611.42s)]
*  That would then be more costly to deal with and I know that this is like the most basic foreign policy 101 [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2616.38s)]
*  But it's like some of the highest value on return money that we spend because we can influence so much of what happens the world through it [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2622.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, uh speaking of a big recipient of foreign aid. Let's talk about pakistan [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2629.5s)]
*  Um, maybe we should maybe debate the roi here [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2633.5s)]
*  So last week ben and I talked about how pakistan was going to this general election [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2636.06s)]
*  It was seen as a farce because the pakistani military had been cracking down on former prime minister imran khan and his political party pti [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2640.38s)]
*  Khan was pushed out of power in 2022. He was arrested in august of last year. He's currently sitting in jail [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2648.7799999999997s)]
*  He was convicted on several different cases that range from corruption to revealing state secrets to his marriage was ruled unislamic [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2654.38s)]
*  Apparently the divorce timeline didn't match up anyway, some of those convictions barred him from running for office [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2661.98s)]
*  So khan's political party pti they were targeted as well [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2666.94s)]
*  Uh pakistani election authorities repeatedly rejected the nomination papers of pti candidates [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2670.06s)]
*  They ruled that pti can't use its cricket bat symbol on ballots. That might sound silly to a western audience [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2674.94s)]
*  Uh, but the bat symbol is very well known in pakistan and 40 of the electorate is illiterate [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2681.6600000000003s)]
*  So the symbol is incredibly important. So all these candidates now are to run as independents, right? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2687.1800000000003s)]
*  Pti candidates said they weren't getting permission to hold rallies their supporters were getting intimidated by the police [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2691.82s)]
*  The list goes on and on so at the same time that was all happening the military cut a deal with former prime minister [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2696.86s)]
*  Nawaz sharif to bring him back from exile and run him as their guy [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2701.9s)]
*  Uh sharif served as prime minister three different times in 2017. He was convicted [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2706.3s)]
*  Uh for corruption on corruption charges is I think he got 10 years in jail, but he fled to london [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2711.5s)]
*  When he came back those charges magically went away. So [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2717.98s)]
*  So [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2720.54s)]
*  Nawaz sharif actually used to be a real mainstay on the dc foreign policy junket circuit [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2721.7400000000002s)]
*  You would see him all the time which really tells you the kind of former military dictator that he is [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2726.38s)]
*  That's of course, of course, right? So fast forward to today or last week's election. That is [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2730.38s)]
*  Despite all of that election interference and a bunch of election day vote rigging that we can get into [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2735.5s)]
*  Um, the pti still managed to win the most seats in the election [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2740.78s)]
*  But nawaz sharif claimed victory anyway said he would form a coalition government. Uh max [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2744.3s)]
*  What do we make of the outcome in the feasibility of demands from some members of congress that the u.s [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2749.9s)]
*  Not even recognize this new government without first investigating in some way these allegations of fraud the islamicness of his marriage. Yes [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2755.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure how you pinned that one down [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2764.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's a it's a truly stunning [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2766.2200000000003s)]
*  electoral victory to despite all of this suppression that you describe to still go out and have so many people in [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2769.7400000000002s)]
*  Pakistan want him to return to office and want his party to return to office to get the most seats [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2777.18s)]
*  He did because he fell short of an outright majority. He is going to have to [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2782.54s)]
*  Try to build a governing coalition. It's entirely possible. He won't it's entirely possible that the military-backed party will do some [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2786.7799999999997s)]
*  Shenanigans or another so he may not end up back in power [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2794.12s)]
*  um, I don't know that this means like [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2798.7s)]
*  Total chaos for Pakistan the country's political system has gone through so many wild ups and downs in the last 20 years. This is [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2801.5s)]
*  You know, it's bigger than a blip, but it's hardly the biggest like roller coaster dip that they've gone on [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2809.82s)]
*  so I don't think we should expect political transformation for this but [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2814.46s)]
*  Imran khan has some leverage now [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2818.46s)]
*  He has some leverage for the size of the block he has in the assembly [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2820.06s)]
*  To try to get some kind of concessions from the military either to let him lead the government or if not to try to get some [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2825.66s)]
*  Kind of you know, maybe let him out of jail let him lead the party, you know a little more directly [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2832.94s)]
*  But i'm sure it'll end up being some kind of like backroom compromise between them [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2838.94s)]
*  Yeah, and just to be clear both of these candidates have had sort of on again off again relationships with the military [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2842.46s)]
*  Uh, those relationships have soured they get thrown out of office. Hopefully this will [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2848.94s)]
*  End in a democratic place but on election day [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2853.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh the government they cut off internet [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2856.46s)]
*  TV stations were told to stop broadcasting results. There were more votes for shreef in some places than there were registered voters [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2859.98s)]
*  So it was like the most blatant [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2866.46s)]
*  Election rigging another remarkable piece of this is the fact that imran khan he's been delivering campaign speeches in air quotes [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2869.02s)]
*  From prison by using artificial intelligence [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2876.54s)]
*  Here's a clip of one of those speeches [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2879.34s)]
*  Such a little clip we found that included some uh, it really sounds like it's remarkably [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2893.42s)]
*  Sounds like it sounds remarkably like him and I find this [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2898.86s)]
*  Both to be an impressive kind of end run around election interference, but also deeply unnerving [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2901.6600000000003s)]
*  I know I think that they it's really incredible how much pti is innovating in the space here and I wonder like [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2906.78s)]
*  How long until we get beleaguered political parties using ai to trot out like dead leaders like, you know [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2912.94s)]
*  The tories get winston churchill back in there get some winston churchill speeches about the nhs and about how people need to come out [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2919.58s)]
*  In 2025 or like, you know congress party is really suffering in india get gandhi bhat on it [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2926.22s)]
*  Get him on the ticket trump will run against and defeat a dead ai lincoln in a primary for his third term [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2931.5s)]
*  I think biden would I think he would team up with ai fdr. I think that would be his choice. Yeah [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2937.5s)]
*  Yeah, jfk would be pretty good. I can still get it. I don't know. It's fucking weird, man [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2941.6600000000003s)]
*  Um a brighter story. So last week we talked about how for the first time in over 100 years [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2946.6200000000003s)]
*  The first minister of northern ireland michelle o'neill is a member of shin fein the political party [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2951.5s)]
*  So marylou mcdonald's the president of shin fein from the republic of ireland said that she believes that there will be a referendum on unifying [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2956.2200000000003s)]
*  The both irelands in the next six years. So that would mean northern ireland is no longer part of the united kingdom [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2964.14s)]
*  The terms of the good friday agreement allow for a vote to be held if it appears there's a majority in support of it [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2969.42s)]
*  I'm, not exactly sure how you very fuzzy determine that [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2974.54s)]
*  um marylou mcdonald seems to be on the path to becoming prime minister of ireland if if [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2977.34s)]
*  You know the trends continue in terms of electorally. What do you make of her claim about the odds of unification? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2982.7s)]
*  I read her wording as a very careful to be less than a promise [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2988.2200000000003s)]
*  She's not saying I will bring a referendum [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2993.5s)]
*  But to be more like a prediction saying like oh i'm sure that it will happen [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=2995.9s)]
*  In the next six years and i'm sure that part of this is she's got [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3000.78s)]
*  Her own party expects her to at least try to bring that about so she has to make some kind of a show of it [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3004.06s)]
*  And i'm sure part of it is also testing the waters and trying to see okay [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3009.5800000000004s)]
*  Let's float a trial balloon. Let's see what the reaction is from london from washington. Let's see what the reaction is from voters in [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3013.1000000000004s)]
*  Both the republic of ireland and in northern ireland majorities of whom would have to prove it [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3019.5800000000004s)]
*  I was kind of surprised to find that it's just a simple majority like 51 percent in both is enough [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3024.6200000000003s)]
*  I think you would want to hire thresholds for [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3030.0600000000004s)]
*  Something that you know [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3032.38s)]
*  Of a big change [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3034.38s)]
*  Uh, I was also kind of surprised to look up the polling [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3035.74s)]
*  um [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3039.74s)]
*  People are less enthusiastic about reunifying ireland that I would have expected within the republican of ireland [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3040.54s)]
*  It's a big majority 64 percent although still not as big as I would have thought [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3046.54s)]
*  You would think that more of them would want northern ireland like back in the fold and within northern ireland. It's only 30 percent in favor [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3050.54s)]
*  50 against and 20 percent undecided and I think those numbers are actually pretty static [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3057.42s)]
*  They've held like that for a while. I think among 18 to 24 year olds [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3063.8199999999997s)]
*  It's 57 percent. So the younger generation is more in favor [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3068.2999999999997s)]
*  So maybe it will grow with time is the play that was that was kind of what happened with scottish voters is that younger? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3072.06s)]
*  People tend to be more enthusiastic about independence and I think what ended up happening is it was [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3078.14s)]
*  less that there was a generational change and more that young people tend to be like [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3084.06s)]
*  Feel a little bit more strongly of an emotional attachment to like, you know [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3087.9s)]
*  The nation and a national reunification or whatever [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3091.18s)]
*  And that people who are older a little bit more concerned with practical concerns like, you know [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3094.54s)]
*  Will I still have access to universities in london, which is something that you hear [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3098.38s)]
*  even [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3102.7799999999997s)]
*  Catholics in northern ireland say like they like being part of the same country as the uk because they get access to stuff like that [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3103.64s)]
*  but something I was struck by is that [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3110.94s)]
*  A clear majority northern ireland 60 percent say that they would want a referendum in the next 10 years [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3114.62s)]
*  So it does seem pretty likely that we will actually get a vote but much less certain what would actually happen [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3119.34s)]
*  I mean again three cheers for brexit [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3125.5s)]
*  Do you think that this is what like these they're always guys? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3128.78s)]
*  Those guys sent this ball rolling right when they they you know northern ireland. I think overwhelmingly voted to remain [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3132.2200000000003s)]
*  They wanted to stay in the eu, right? They got dragged out by a bunch of folks over and yeah [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3138.54s)]
*  They kind of had the best of both worlds [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3143.7400000000002s)]
*  They got to be in the eu and they got to be part of britain and they did not have [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3145.34s)]
*  But they also got to be part of ireland right because good friday means that it's a porous border [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3150.3s)]
*  And I think that it actually I was much more concerned initially [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3154.46s)]
*  about um sentiment in ireland or even the resumption of conflict because it looked like they might have to reimpose a hard border because of [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3159.42s)]
*  brexit [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3166.44s)]
*  Thank god they got around that and now people can consider [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3167.26s)]
*  Irish unification not in a crisis but more in a like well if we had the option would we want to do it? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3171.5s)]
*  Yeah, maybe they will it's actually the one thing rishi sunek I think deserves a little credit for was kind of managing that crisis [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3176.78s)]
*  I think so last thing so again. We talked last week about prince charles. He recently announced he has cancer [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3182.22s)]
*  We don't know what kind exactly but we know it was discovered when he was getting tested for prostate cancer. So [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3188.3s)]
*  That news sent the little um, the coterie of official royal watchers into overdrive [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3193.74s)]
*  Uh, they all went on tv. They all got booked places [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3200.24s)]
*  One of them went viral last week when he said he believed that charles would not get chemotherapy [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3203.3599999999997s)]
*  It is more likely to get a course of treatment of just natural medicine homeopathic medicine [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3208.72s)]
*  Um, of course, this was during an interview with nijil faraj. I believe yeah, so great grain assault the biggest grain assault the most [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3214.08s)]
*  cigarette smelling boozy grain assault you can buy [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3220.7999999999997s)]
*  Max what do we know about the king's eccentric medical views? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3224.2400000000002s)]
*  He has always been uh, I think you would say a bit of a contrarian when it comes to uh, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3228.0s)]
*  Modern medicine. He's not full rfk jr. He's not an anti-vax guy [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3234.4s)]
*  But he uh, he referred to modern medicine as quote the celebrated tower of pisa slightly off balance [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3238.4s)]
*  Uh, he's a big fan of ancient folk healing [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3246.0s)]
*  He loves to talk about homeopathy. What is ancient folk healing? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3249.44s)]
*  Listen if you gotta ask, okay [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3253.04s)]
*  I don't know. They're mandolin music. What are we talking about ancient folks in england? I don't know. Sorry to interrupt continue [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3255.44s)]
*  What are just these people? Okay, i'm gonna go i'm gonna do some reporting i'm gonna get the uh, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3260.7999999999997s)]
*  English equivalent of traditional chinese medicine whatever that is. It's cup of tea. I'm sure whatever it is. It's a cup of right. Yeah [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3265.52s)]
*  Um a stiff breeze [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3272.08s)]

*  But look, I mean it's his own doing yeah, and this is just this is what they the what they sowed, you know, they they [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3582.24s)]
*  when you [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3589.44s)]
*  Create a caucus [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3590.88s)]
*  That is all about just tearing down government. Yeah [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3593.12s)]

*  I mean the rest of the world leaders are just like what is happening in america [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3605.6s)]
*  Yeah, I I was gonna ask you about that piece of it because obviously, you know [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3608.96s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that congress isn't doing [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3614.2400000000002s)]
*  Through no fault of your own or house democrats [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3617.44s)]
*  But you know like take the ukraine funding for instance [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3621.12s)]
*  This is [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3624.96s)]
*  Not like some fancy new capability that has to be advanced through congress. This is basically maintaining [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3626.4s)]
*  The level of support that literally is allowing people on the front lines of ukraine [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3632.48s)]
*  To survive to have artillery to fight back against russians to to have you know, the basic [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3637.22s)]

*  What is the bigger cost? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3654.8199999999997s)]
*  You know and you could say the same thing about the border by the way like instead of trying to fix that they're just trying to like [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3656.5s)]
*  Impeach the sector of human security, but how do you how do you put it in perspective in terms of the credibility issues that are on the line here? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3661.06s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I I one of the most vivid conversations I had in the last year [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3668.6600000000003s)]
*  It was it was actually last year [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3673.06s)]
*  You remember like we were on the precipice of of defaulting on our debt as a country [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3674.9s)]
*  Yeah, and I had this, you know leader from another country [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3680.1s)]
*  Call me and just ask me like andy like you're not really gonna default on your debt. Are you? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3683.54s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like well look like i'm gonna do everything we can to not have that happen [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3688.1s)]
*  But I I cannot actually tell you for sure [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3692.58s)]
*  and the person on the other end of the phone like you can hear him just kind of like kind of like [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3695.22s)]
*  Kind of chuckle just like he was just like, huh? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3699.22s)]
*  and [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3701.86s)]
*  What he went on to say just stuck in my head [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3702.66s)]
*  He said I just want you to know that when i'm talking to other people in my government or when our government is talking to [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3704.74s)]
*  other countries, you know, this particular leader was [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3710.18s)]
*  Is in in asia [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3713.54s)]
*  He said the question we ask ourselves is is america a reliable partner? Yeah [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3715.3s)]
*  And he says we've you know, we have to say we know the answer to that [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3720.5s)]
*  Yeah, and and that's what I find so sad right now is like we can have the biggest military in the world [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3724.1800000000003s)]
*  Which we do we can have the largest diplomatic footprint all over the world have the strong economy [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3728.6600000000003s)]
*  But if people don't think you're reliable [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3734.98s)]
*  What value is it? Yeah, you know, and I think that that's what i've been thinking about is is [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3738.26s)]
*  Trying to redefine what strength means. It's not just about you know how your hard power [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3743.3s)]
*  It's not just about capabilities and how many you know aircraft you have or ships you have [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3747.94s)]
*  Strength is also about reliability and right now the the fundamental question is what is the value of the american handshake? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3753.38s)]
*  Yeah, and I think people [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3759.6200000000003s)]
*  Don't value because they they say they they actually have this term that I keep hearing called american whiplash [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3761.94s)]
*  Yeah, you know you join the paris climate agreement you leave the paris climate agreement [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3766.9s)]
*  You come back in they don't know what to trust and right now they just assume their baseline assumption [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3770.26s)]
*  Is that the next administration if it changes parties will just just uh, you know rip off and and tear down everything that was done before [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3776.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, and so that credibility is gone. Yeah, when you see the the clown show in congress right now [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3784.5800000000004s)]
*  It certainly doesn't help [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3791.6200000000003s)]
*  Okay, so a different [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3793.2200000000003s)]
*  credibility issue [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3795.28s)]
*  Deals with you know, one of your opponents assuming senator manendez continues to run for reelection [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3796.8999999999996s)]
*  Um different kind of handshake deals that he was involved in. Um, but with other countries with other well, that's the thing [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3803.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I like I wanted to ask you uh [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3808.5s)]
*  You know, well first of all [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3812.3399999999997s)]
*  Let's just start with manendez and then i'm going to broaden out to kind of this issue of corruption more generally [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3814.66s)]
*  You know, what what did you? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3819.14s)]
*  You know you announced that you were running pretty much as soon as these latest corruption allegations hit [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3821.7799999999997s)]
*  And it felt like you did that because it kind of had a visceral reaction. Um [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3827.3799999999997s)]
*  What was your reaction to seeing this? You must have gotten to know manendez [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3831.8599999999997s)]
*  Uh, we dealt with him or I did not very pleasantly, you know when I was in the white house [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3836.02s)]
*  He was not a fan of you know, the iran deal in cuba, but put that aside [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3840.74s)]
*  Um, you must have dealt with him in new jersey politics. He had a bit of a whiff of corruption around him [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3844.18s)]
*  This isn't the first time. Yeah, exactly. But this one is so extreme, right? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3848.5s)]
*  Uh with you know gold bars in his house and he's spying for the egyptians and he's leveraging the chairmanship of the foreign relations committee for foreign interest [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3853.54s)]
*  What what hit you? What was your reaction? And why did you decide to run for office? Yeah, you know, I mean it was [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3861.54s)]
*  It was a kind of a culmination of a lot of feelings and it wasn't just about the senator [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3867.78s)]
*  I think you know being there for five years and seeing [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3873.14s)]
*  Like the way I often say is like I I work alongside people that in congress that should just should not be there [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3877.14s)]
*  Yeah, you know like the people who are much more interested in being social influencers rather than lawmakers [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3883.62s)]
*  Yeah, and they don't respect the gravity of this job that like I work a job whose job description is in the constitution of the united states [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3889.94s)]
*  Yeah, like article one is our job description. That is a humbling experience [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3896.8199999999997s)]
*  So when I when I saw that indictment of my senator [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3901.62s)]
*  I just I just kind of I just hit a breaking point [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3906.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and I just you know, I just said like look like we deserve better as a country [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3908.8199999999997s)]
*  You know like how is it that in this amazing nation of 330 million people some of the smartest most innovative people in the world [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3913.06s)]
*  Like how is it that we can find, you know? [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3920.02s)]
*  435 people in the house of representatives and 100 people all we need are 535 [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3923.2s)]
*  Americans, yeah that like have integrity [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3929.7599999999998s)]
*  Have capabilities expertise strengths in that capacity and honesty [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3933.1600000000003s)]
*  but we struggle and so [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3938.1200000000003s)]
*  I just you know at that night after the indictment. I just couldn't get a single minute of sleep [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3940.84s)]
*  I just I was just so my head was just spinning [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3945.1600000000003s)]
*  And the next day, you know, I sat down with my wife and we talked about it [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3948.6000000000004s)]
*  And I said I you know, and we made the decision together as they should be [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3951.88s)]
*  That I think I need to step up. Yeah, because you I mean you had no like master plan to be running for senate this cycle [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3955.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, no, I mean i'm a tired dad of a six-year-old and an eight-year-old [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3961.24s)]
*  And I got seven and nine. I know [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3964.3599999999997s)]
*  So like probably not high on the list for in your mind is to run statewide. I'm doing a podcast [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3966.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, I want to broaden this out too because I mean I found it disappointing that menendez is still on the senate foreign relations committee [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3974.68s)]
*  But there's this issue of foreign corruption, you know, we dealt with in the trump years [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3983.7999999999997s)]
*  It wasn't subtle that you know, the saudis are pouring money into trump hotel properties [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3988.44s)]
*  Jared kushner you were kind of waiting for the back-end deal and sure enough as soon as he leaves [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3994.28s)]
*  Government having been you know, the saudis point man in washington [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=3999.56s)]
*  He gets kind of two billion dollars plowed into his investment fund. Look when you and I were at the nsc [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4003.32s)]
*  you know, I I you know, even things like the lavish kind of parties that you know [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4008.6s)]
*  You know emirates or qataris might throw in washington. I mean particularly from the gulf [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4013.64s)]
*  There's a lot of money and we should be clear these menendez indictments include [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4019.0s)]
*  egypt [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4023.24s)]
*  And qatar a feature very prominently in them [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4024.44s)]
*  What can be done to kind of? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4028.04s)]
*  Restore some confidence among americans that that this isn't for sale that what menendez was doing isn't the norm [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4031.0s)]
*  And and even I should say that like if menendez may be the extreme version of it, you know [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4037.8799999999997s)]
*  Like taking gold bars and doing favors that there's still some kind of almost legalized corruption [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4041.8s)]
*  Like a lot of the stuff jared kushner did didn't break a law because there's not a law that exists against [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4046.6000000000004s)]
*  You know taking care of some rich, uh [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4051.48s)]
*  People in office and then cashing out immediately on the back end [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4053.8s)]
*  I mean have you thought at all about how to restore confidence? Yeah, I mean, I think that that's a big part of of [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4056.52s)]
*  what [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4062.28s)]
*  You know what? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4063.1600000000003s)]
*  Broken me that said like we got to stop this [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4064.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean we live in the time of the greatest amount of distrust in government in modern american history [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4066.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, there's a survey in new jersey 84 percent of people in new jersey believe that their politicians are corrupt [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4071.16s)]
*  84 like this is the existential to our democracy if we're [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4076.6800000000003s)]
*  And it's as you said, it's not just here in the united states right right now writ large around the world [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4082.28s)]
*  There is just this division that's occurring where people [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4088.36s)]
*  A lot of people in my dick my congressional district. They just think like government is just you know on some elite plane [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4092.52s)]
*  And they're they're playing with other people's chips. They're not feeling the the hurt themselves. They're not feeling the struggles themselves [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4099.400000000001s)]
*  And you know that gets reinforced when you just have you know millionaires and billionaires [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4106.360000000001s)]
*  I mean this is why you know [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4110.280000000001s)]
*  Probably the biggest most popular piece of legislation that I have right now in congress is that you know [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4111.320000000001s)]
*  I have legislation that would try to ban members of congress [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4115.8s)]
*  And senior executive branch and judicial branch officials from owning and trading individual stocks for instance [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4119.08s)]
*  Yeah, because people just have this deep distrust [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4124.76s)]
*  They just feel like you know sure, you know [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4127.08s)]
*  They're just making these decisions that are just trying to benefit their own [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4128.84s)]
*  personal ambitions or their bank account [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4133.400000000001s)]
*  and [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4136.6s)]
*  you know, it just [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4137.72s)]
*  You when you see things like what happened what happened with senator menendez or what you're saying with jerry kushner and others like it [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4139.320000000001s)]
*  Just reinforces that right? Yeah, and so [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4144.6s)]
*  What the danger is on that front and I see it in new jersey [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4148.12s)]
*  This is what we're fighting against because i've been saying this line a lot lately and I feel like it's becoming more and more true [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4151.08s)]
*  Of just saying I believe the opposite of democracy is apathy [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4156.6s)]
*  Yeah, and there's so many people that are like right on that cusp [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4159.96s)]
*  I'm sure some americans have gone over that where they just feel like like the corruption is too deep [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4163.8s)]
*  Too entrenched. Yeah, there's nothing we can do about it. Yeah, and that's when people just start to give up [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4169.16s)]
*  you know and and [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4174.92s)]
*  You know you can feel that right now in the electorate as we get towards the 2024 election [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4176.5199999999995s)]
*  I can feel it in new jersey people just being like like look the sopranos was filmed here [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4181.719999999999s)]
*  That this is just a part of like jersey politics, you know is corruption. Yeah [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4187.08s)]
*  But what i'm proud of is that with this campaign and shining a light on it standing up to it [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4191.799999999999s)]
*  You know and and and look like it's not just the the the senior senator from my state [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4197.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm literally running against the most powerful political family in my state right now [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4202.04s)]
*  In the primary in the primary with the governor's wife in this race [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4206.2s)]
*  But like [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4211.4800000000005s)]
*  I think people are just kind of tired of that [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4212.76s)]
*  Yeah, you know and I think I can try to represent and hopefully bring about you know a sense that [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4215.0s)]
*  You know politics doesn't have to just be for the elite [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4220.76s)]
*  Yeah [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4223.24s)]
*  It doesn't have to be just for the well-off and well-connected that like a son of immigrants a public school kid like myself [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4223.4800000000005s)]
*  You know should have a fair shot. Yeah, and and that hopefully helps kind of shatter that sense of apathy [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4229.8s)]
*  well, yeah, I mean [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4235.5599999999995s)]
*  it's interesting how you put it because [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4237.4s)]
*  You know, I look at something like menendez and uh, it makes me think about something that um, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4239.32s)]
*  Alexi and avalny of all people said to me when I was talking to him for my my last book. He said [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4245.24s)]
*  You know putin [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4250.28s)]
*  Doesn't need to convince [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4251.719999999999s)]
*  His own people that he's not corrupt. You know [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4253.639999999999s)]
*  He just convinces them that everybody's corrupt, you know [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4257.08s)]
*  Um [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4260.2s)]
*  that essentially everybody knows pudin's on the take and that he's got you know, these big houses and [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4261.4s)]
*  But but you know his message [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4265.88s)]
*  Is that well the whole system's corrupt the americans are corrupt that you know [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4267.88s)]
*  There's not some better version of this and and you know when he said that I I thought immediately of trump, you know [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4270.92s)]
*  And it does just kind of feel [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4276.76s)]
*  Um like and looks I think a lot of this is unfair and there's a lot of missing disinformation [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4279.4s)]
*  You know, they talk about the biden crime family without any evidence [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4283.88s)]
*  But then you have a menendez who's a democrat and he's taking gold bars and you know [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4287.08s)]
*  There's things that that the democratic machines as you say, I mean you you touched on this a bit but [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4290.92s)]
*  This is clearly going to take a while to fix [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4296.6s)]
*  What have you found in your time and active politics after being in kind of jobs like we had [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4300.28s)]
*  That makes you think that there's a way through this like is it how much of it is mobilizing people how much of it is? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4306.6s)]
*  Getting different kinds of people maybe younger people in politics how much of it is like laws like you said about [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4313.4s)]
*  You know owning trading stocks like what is the the formula over time that can begin to? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4319.24s)]
*  Address some of that understandable apathy people. Yeah, you know, I'd say there are two things that are kind of intersecting here [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4325.32s)]
*  One is that you know [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4331.08s)]
*  Before I came into congress, I was a career public servant and I was a career government official [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4333.08s)]
*  You know, I wasn't an appointee myself, you know, so I I worked my way up from the photocopy room at the state department [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4337.88s)]
*  Yeah, and I worked alongside people still to this day. They were at my wedding but still to this day [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4344.2s)]
*  I actually don't know if they're registered democrats or republicans like we were just doing the work [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4349.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4354.12s)]
*  And that kind of just gave me a sense that there's a way to do public service where you know [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4355.08s)]
*  You don't have to wear your [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4360.04s)]
*  Partisanship on your sleeve and you can try to address things in terms of like the magnitude of the problem [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4361.72s)]
*  What you're trying to solve and try to lift up ideas based off the merits of the idea not who wrote the bill [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4366.68s)]
*  What party are they from? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4372.84s)]
*  But then the other aspect of this is once I got into elected office. I mean, yeah [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4374.84s)]
*  I represented when I first came into congress. I represented a district. I won a district that was 85% white [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4379.56s)]
*  You know voted for trump twice less than three percent asian population [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4385.64s)]
*  You know like people didn't think that i'm you know [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4389.72s)]
*  I'm not central casting of what you would think the congressman from my congressional district would look like the fact that trump was on [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4392.04s)]
*  The ballot in 2020 won my district, but I did as well [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4398.12s)]
*  I was one of only seven democrats in the country that won a district trump won that year [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4401.88s)]
*  And I don't know it gave me hope. Yeah, it gave me hope that if you if you go out there and you put in the work [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4406.76s)]
*  And you know i've done now 71 town halls like I I have I practice a very particular type of politics [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4414.12s)]
*  Yeah, one that you know is about accessibility and engagement [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4420.44s)]
*  You know, I I we always like to say, you know [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4425.5599999999995s)]
*  I want to be a workhorse not a show horse and just get out there and do the work [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4427.96s)]
*  And the fact that you know, i'm somebody that you know [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4432.44s)]
*  Worked under technically worked. You know started under you know, the bush administration worked on the obama administration because I was a career guy [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4434.76s)]
*  I [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4441.0s)]
*  Think oh, you know i'm able to kind of connect in [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4442.4400000000005s)]
*  Even with people who voted for trump [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4445.56s)]
*  So I don't know if it just gives me a sense that like if if I can pull it off [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4447.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's probably some ways to do it like if uh, yeah, you know like if in a you know, predominantly white [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4451.320000000001s)]
*  You know this or that vote for trump with a you know majority non-college educated [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4458.4400000000005s)]
*  Electorate has now you know three times elected a you know, korean-american road scholar phd democrat [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4464.02s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I just feel like there's got to be something here about bridging some of these divides [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4469.88s)]
*  That that isn't just you know, I want to believe that our country isn't as [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4475.320000000001s)]
*  Entrenched and polarized as it is. There's still a way to fix it. Do you think um, do you worry? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4479.8s)]
*  You mentioned the identity piece of this and we're out here in la i'm sure that [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4486.68s)]
*  There's like a pretty proud, you know korean-american population out here about what you're doing [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4491.08s)]
*  But you also see all this rhetoric anti-asian anti-chinese and this intersects with foreign policy all this [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4495.0s)]
*  demagoguery of the chinese in particular [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4501.32s)]
*  Like uh, does that kind of ugly kind of foreign policy or identity-based discourse? [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4503.96s)]
*  How does that reverberate through some of the communities that uh might feel vulnerable about that here? [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4509.72s)]
*  Yeah, look, it's it's a real concern and you know [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4514.92s)]
*  I say that someone who's who's working in foreign policy on the committees that are dealing with this [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4516.92s)]
*  I'm also on a select committee about u.s. China relations [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4521.56s)]
*  and um [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4524.92s)]
*  You know, I think about it a lot as someone who worked in diplomacy before but also as an asian-american [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4526.04s)]
*  And you know, my wife is chinese-american. My kids are korean, you know, chinese-american little boys [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4532.2s)]
*  And you know i've seen already just you know [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4538.36s)]
*  My my oldest my oldest son came home from school one day saying that you know [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4540.28s)]
*  The bigger kid just kept teasing him calling him chinese boy chinese boy over and over again [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4543.5599999999995s)]
*  And we've seen the violence and the discrimination in the asian-american facing the asian-american community [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4547.88s)]
*  And I worry that as we look at the this question of u.s. China relations, which will be [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4553.48s)]
*  challenging for decades to come [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4559.22s)]
*  How how does that not turn into a new era of xenophobia in our country? How do we do this? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4561.32s)]
*  How do we engage in this talk about it in a way that doesn't inflame that? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4565.72s)]
*  I'm not saying I've found the magic solution [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4569.48s)]
*  But I think finding ways to be able to engage communities, you know here and in new jersey and elsewhere [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4571.5599999999995s)]
*  And listen and and lift it up and you know, I hope to be able to play that role [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4578.3s)]
*  You know if if elected i'd be the first korean-american ever in the senate [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4582.22s)]
*  I'd also be the first asian-american ever elected to the u.s. Senate from the entire east coast of america [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4585.34s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think there's opportunities here to show that we can have a seat at the table [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4590.46s)]
*  Yeah, but I think the other thing that i'm proud of is that showing that [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4595.02s)]
*  You know, I have every bit as right as much right to represent my district or my state as anybody else [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4598.14s)]
*  Yeah, and I represent not just people that look like me asian-americans [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4603.0199999999995s)]
*  But asian-americans we can represent not just asian-american heavy areas of our country, but anywhere [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4607.0199999999995s)]
*  and so, you know the more that we can have that sense of of [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4613.179999999999s)]
*  representation that sense that [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4616.44s)]
*  um of of I don't want to say integration but that that sense of just connectivity, yeah [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4618.86s)]
*  Uh, I think the better and you know, I mean you you and I we we worked there at the white house. We saw how [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4625.179999999999s)]
*  you know, you know [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4630.86s)]
*  Political figures and white houses like they often can bring in diaspora communities in the united states to get their thoughts [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4633.0199999999995s)]
*  And yeah, they're buying that doesn't really happen when it comes to issues about asia [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4640.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know like i've never experienced that even as a korean-american in congress like I don't hear people go [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4644.7s)]
*  Oh like let's go ask these people what they think. Yeah. Yeah [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4650.379999999999s)]
*  Like who in the korean-american community think we should talk about about north korea and what like that just doesn't happen [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4653.98s)]
*  Yeah, like it does when it comes to israel when it comes to europe or elsewhere [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4658.86s)]
*  Yeah, so, you know, I think that that's a place where we could do better. Yeah, or even out here armenia, you know [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4662.78s)]
*  uh, I I uh one last question, you know, because you mentioned time the white house and [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4666.94s)]
*  You know, it's been interesting [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4671.9s)]
*  hearing you basically talk about [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4673.58s)]
*  just basically treating people with dignity and [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4676.0599999999995s)]
*  And listening and respecting views one of the things I remember most are working with you is that you and I [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4679.58s)]
*  And part of this was diaspora, but part of this was also just meeting with vulnerable people [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4684.7s)]
*  in the midst of at the time it was isis, right, so [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4689.179999999999s)]
*  You and I met a bunch with [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4692.62s)]
*  Yazidis who were being targeted by isis for genocide [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4694.54s)]
*  Syrian christians, uh that basically were losing their place, you know [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4698.78s)]
*  Sometimes I worry that american foreign policy [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4705.419999999999s)]
*  You know is so focused on these big pieces that are moving around the map or you know [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4708.379999999999s)]
*  We have the drama, you know of disagreement with netanyahu or we're trying to make a deal with mbs [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4712.78s)]
*  We what we should bring the table that russia and china doesn't is that we should kind of care about those communities [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4719.42s)]
*  You know like the the forgotten communities the syrian christians the [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4725.66s)]
*  Yazidis and and you know could all around the world. I mean is it what is there more? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4729.5599999999995s)]
*  Now i'm calling back a fairly, you know, uh specific experience you and I had together [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4734.94s)]
*  But now you've been in congress you were looking at maybe being in senate [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4739.1s)]
*  I'm sure you'd potentially be on the senate farm relations committee. Like is there more that can be done to kind of broaden? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4741.660000000001s)]
*  How american farm policy looks at countries and populations around the world? Yeah, I mean, I think just writ large [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4747.580000000001s)]
*  You know as our as our world is getting more and more complicated, you know [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4754.06s)]
*  You know when I was before I got into diplomacy, I remember writing, you know [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4758.38s)]
*  a paper where I talked about how [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4763.26s)]
*  You know transnational problems require transnational solutions and this like idea that there there's there needs to be a density of connective tissue [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4765.26s)]
*  You know just kind of around the world [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4773.42s)]
*  But you know as you saw like when we're at the state department or the white house [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4774.54s)]
*  It's easy to just kind of go state to state [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4777.66s)]
*  Yeah [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4779.66s)]
*  And just kind of engage at that level and and and because you know that in and of itself is very complicated [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4780.14s)]
*  but like [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4785.820000000001s)]
*  Especially when we're thinking like u.s [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4786.780000000001s)]
*  China right now or or others like we need to be thinking a lot more of just like people to people [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4788.06s)]
*  Yeah, you know and and also for our foreign policy to be thinking about how we can engage in that capacity [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4792.86s)]
*  I've been trying to encourage a lot of national security officials ambassadors and others go out there talk of college campuses in america [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4798.54s)]
*  Yeah, you know like let's learn how to talk human about some of these issues that are going on like these town halls [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4805.42s)]
*  People want to engage there's this kind of idea that voters don't care about foreign policy unless we're directly in a war [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4811.18s)]
*  It's not true. Yeah, I just did a town hall half the questions were about foreign policy [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4817.74s)]
*  What i've learned is that people [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q33s8dWqRI4&t=4822.78s)]
