*  Which is an extraordinary book about an extraordinary family story [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=35.980000000000004s)]
*  That we'll get to but I just want to congratulate you on [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=41.38s)]

*  I'm excited that today's the book launch [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=63.900000000000006s)]
*  But I'm also excited that means there's no more no more book stuff to do and when I've forgotten how much went into that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=65.26s)]
*  I that'll be when I start to consider another book. I I admire you know, put out books on a regular basis [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=71.34s)]
*  I'm not one of them. Well, this is a good one. Everybody should pick it up [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=77.5s)]
*  But today first we're gonna talk about the latest news out of Gaza [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=81.42s)]
*  Including the kind of back-and-forth on a potential ceasefire and hostage deal [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=84.84s)]
*  the potential [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  Rafa invasion which could be happening at least in some kind of motion as we speak [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=92.04s)]
*  The US responds to those things including President Biden making some comments today [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=97.84s)]
*  As well as the recent decision by Israel to shut down Al Jazeera, which is one of Ali's former employers [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Then we'll get into the latest out of Russia Ukraine including President Putin's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=110.2s)]
*  inauguration a potential assassination plot that was foiled against President Zelensky [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=114.76s)]
*  Xi Jinping is in Europe and the story we've been following out of Canada [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=120.64s)]
*  Canada pressing charges for the killing of a Sikh separatist on its soil [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  They say by Indian intelligence so a lot to get into and then after [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=128.6s)]
*  We'll talk about Ali's book and then I'm gonna be joined by Nika Kovac [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=134.0s)]
*  Who is a good friend of mine a Slovenian activist leading the fight to codify a woman's right to abortion in Europe [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=137.42s)]
*  So a lot to look forward to but Ali let's dig into the latest out of Gaza [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=143.83999999999997s)]
*  so a [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=149.42s)]
*  Lot is developing the last 24 to 48 hours [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=151.14s)]
*  It's Tuesday morning here in LA [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=154.1s)]
*  The latest information that we have is that there is clearly some type of Israeli military operation underway in Rafa [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=155.94s)]
*  Although the IDF at this moment is still calling it a more minor and targeted incursion [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=161.82s)]
*  But we see airstrikes we see even tank movements into Rafa [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=166.52s)]
*  We've seen [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=171.24s)]
*  Obviously the Hamas rocket fire at the Krim Shalom crossing one of the eight crossings [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  It also killed four Israeli soldiers a number of days ago [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=178.08s)]
*  We've seen the Israeli military send out evacuation orders to about a hundred thousand civilians in Rafa [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=181.52s)]
*  As they've done before some of their other ground operations [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=187.56s)]
*  So there's a lot in motion and we're gonna get to Rafa and how consequential that would be but first [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to get into this back and forth about a ceasefire [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=196.68s)]
*  So on Monday after days in which both Israel and the United States were kind of pinning the blame for a lack of a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=200.34s)]
*  Ceasefire deal on Hamas Hamas announced through their telegram channels [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=206.88s)]
*  That they had agreed to a ceasefire deal that they had discussed with Egypt and Qatar after a weekend of reports in which [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=212.0s)]
*  It was reported those talks had failed [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=220.28s)]
*  now [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=222.96s)]
*  Israel pretty immediately [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Said it had not agreed to the terms that Hamas agreed to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=226.04s)]
*  Ali you reported this via X which I still call Twitter [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  What you reported is that Hamas had accepted a three-phase deal one Israeli hostage for 33 Palestinian prisoners based on seniority [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=235.39999999999998s)]
*  Of those detained in Israeli prisons [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=243.2s)]
*  stopping military operations permanently [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=245.92s)]
*  Not using the word ceasefire, but rather a permanent halt to Israeli military operations in Gaza [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  And then each phase of this deal [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=253.6s)]
*  encompasses the return of Israeli hostages starting with the elderly then women sick and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=256.24s)]
*  People and then finally soldiers as I hear this [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=261.44s)]
*  Essentially the differences are [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  You have you know somewhere about 33 hostages Israeli hostages would be out in this first phase [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=267.68s)]
*  The real differences seem to be about the duration of this ceasefire [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=274.36s)]
*  Is it a temporary pause for 40 days or is it something more lasting? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=278.96s)]
*  and maybe some haggling about the sequencing of [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=283.76000000000005s)]
*  Hostage releases versus Palestinian prisoner releases, but Ali what do you make of the current state of play and on your reporting in your analysis? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, it was some it was some interesting stagecraft [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=294.20000000000005s)]
*  Hamas agreeing to a proposal that wasn't exactly the proposal [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  That they were given but it's not it wasn't completely invented out of thin air [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=303.0s)]
*  They were in discussions with the with the Qataris and with the Egyptians about this deal [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think you're right that around the edge [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=312.32s)]
*  It seems like there's a lot of detail in it [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=314.96s)]
*  In fact much more than I I posted on social media these kinds of things don't lend themselves to social media because because there's so much detail [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=317.2s)]
*  There's a lot of detail in it. So it strikes me that this was sort of a hammered-out [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=324.44s)]
*  General understanding of how the process could go but there are both semantic and real [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  Impediments here the semantic impediments are about an end to the war a cessation of hostilities versus pauses [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=336.52s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be a world in which Netanyahu and his hard-right allies in the government [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=342.88s)]
*  Want any system that doesn't allow them to in their opinion finish the war which involves? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=350.0s)]
*  getting rid entirely of Hamas, that's a [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=357.44s)]
*  Philosophical question that the United States and Israel have been at odds with since day one and that is because Hamas comes from a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=361.44s)]
*  Philosophy that has existed for a long time largely born in the 1930s. It's the same philosophy that gave birth to the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=368.96s)]
*  Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt that is alive and well, even though illegal in in Egypt [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=375.76s)]
*  So the US has said from the beginning your goal is wrong [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  But it now seems that if Israel continues to stipulate the wrong goal [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=384.21999999999997s)]
*  It means no deal will really be acceptable [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=388.76s)]
*  Israel Netanyahu in particular is understanding that a deal that results in the release of the hostages [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=391.88s)]
*  Probably puts him out of a job or largely puts him out of you know [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=399.44s)]
*  puts him in a situation where there'll be an election at some point and his raison d'etre is not going to be as [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  Strong to be there. I think Hamas leadership also gets that that there may always be something that feels like Hamas and that is Hamas [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=407.88s)]
*  ideology, but ultimately [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=415.48s)]
*  Israel knows how to take people out and it's got a history of assassination and if these guys make some kind of deal and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=417.8s)]
*  Go somewhere else go live in Lebanon or Qatar or Switzerland or wherever they go live [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=423.0s)]
*  Israel will probably take them out as well over time [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=427.24s)]
*  so I think everybody's realizing that the end game means the players don't get to continue the sad part is that the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=430.24s)]
*  Israeli hostages and their families remain and we don't know how many are alive and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  Palestinians are being told to get into yet smaller areas than they're already in to protect from this attack in in Rafa [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=442.88s)]
*  I mean it's ridiculous [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=449.64000000000004s)]
*  It was already one of the most densely populated places in the world now [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=450.44s)]
*  They got everybody that they could into into Rafa and now they're squeezing them into little places in Rafa [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=453.68s)]
*  And they're using the attack on Rafa which started as you said [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=459.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not really an attack but the pressure on Rafa to put pressure on Hamas to say [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=462.46000000000004s)]
*  Except the deal we actually gave you so I think everybody's working over time in this moment the Americans are trying to tell [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=467.3s)]
*  Hamas you're not gonna get a lot of offers like this and they're insisting to Israel including by holding back on a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=475.06s)]
*  Shipment of weaponry last week, which is something we haven't seen before to say we're serious about this [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=480.7s)]
*  So I'm hoping I'm hoping at any point someone interrupts some discussion somewhere that I'm having in the next day or two and says [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=485.65999999999997s)]
*  there is something that looks like a deal, but [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=491.86s)]
*  Hopeful and optimistic are due to different things. Yeah, I I tend to completely agree with that analysis [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=495.02s)]
*  I mean you have a situation which if there is a kind of long-term [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=501.46s)]
*  ceasefire [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=507.06s)]
*  It's hard to see how there's not an election in Israel that leads to Netanyahu's ouster, right? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=508.65999999999997s)]
*  If there is a rough operation, you know [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=512.68s)]
*  There's gonna be immense humanitarian suffering which we'll get to in a second [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=515.98s)]
*  But also some of those some of us leaders will likely be killed but Hamas itself won't be destroyed [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=519.18s)]
*  And so we're at this kind of grim milestone where all you can hope for is that some kind of deal can at least allow for [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=524.8199999999999s)]
*  hostage releases and then the alleviation of some of the suffering and Gaza from the delivery of aid [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=531.9399999999999s)]
*  But I think people need to kind of get their minds around what may be about to happen in Rafa [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=537.86s)]
*  So the Israeli war cabinet has voted already unanimously to support this offensive [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=542.46s)]
*  What you have is a situation where there's you know anywhere from 1.3 to even 1.5 million people sheltering in Rafa [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  I think you know over 600,000 of whom are children, right? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=554.22s)]
*  Which really speaks to the immensity of the humanitarian catastrophe that we could be [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=559.16s)]
*  Facing Israel's begun to kind of increase the pace of airstrikes. We've got these reports of tanks [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  Rolling in but also the Rafa crossing is where aid is generally gotten in [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  And so we're gonna play a couple clips here about people who've been involved in the humanitarian response to give a sense of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=576.3800000000001s)]
*  the situation on the ground [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=582.0200000000001s)]
*  From Yanti Seripto who's the CEO of save the children? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=584.34s)]
*  We've heard from on this podcast and Jonathan Fowler who's a spokesman for unra based in East Jerusalem [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=587.7s)]
*  So we'll go to those clips now Ali and then we'll get your response to it [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=593.46s)]
*  The latest escalation in Gaza is making the most difficult [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=596.7s)]
*  Humanitarian situation even worse and I didn't think I was gonna say that again and again and again over these last six months [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=601.74s)]
*  For weeks, we've been warning that there is no feasible evacuation plan for the 1.5 million people [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=608.66s)]
*  Who had fled to Rafa from all over Gaza? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=615.14s)]
*  For save the children a very compromised humanitarian assistance operation has been made even harder still the Rafa crossing and Kerem [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=619.62s)]
*  Shalom are closed as of Sunday. That means no new fuel. No new clean water [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=628.18s)]
*  No food is making its way into the Gaza Strip [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=634.8599999999999s)]
*  but that does [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=638.6999999999999s)]
*  to children to the food security situation to looming famine and [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=640.26s)]
*  To hospitals they have no fuel to run their incubators. I don't need to spell out for you [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=645.02s)]
*  The issue with Rafa of course is that it's the only way that we've been able to get fuel into the Gaza Strip [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=650.42s)]
*  Now this is hugely problematic because fuel is essential for the trucks that move aid around the Gaza Strip [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=657.54s)]
*  It's also essential for the pumping stations that keep the water clean and drinkable [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=664.26s)]
*  That the pumping stations that get the the sewage out [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=669.42s)]
*  Public sanitation all these kind of operations fall apart in the absence of fuel now as of yesterday [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=674.14s)]
*  We only had one day of fuel left [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=681.02s)]
*  So we're in the situation where it's it's it's highly likely [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=683.3s)]
*  There's a huge risk in fact that operations will simply grind to a halt tomorrow absent any kind of fuel [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=687.74s)]
*  We simply don't have the reserves that are necessary. So there you have it. It's both the the consequence for the people in [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=694.22s)]
*  Rafa [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=701.62s)]
*  Who are potentially caught in the middle of this operation? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=702.7s)]
*  Many of whom have already been displaced once twice or three times [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=705.5s)]
*  Yeah, but also the the lack of the capacity to get aid back in and famine-like conditions [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=708.4599999999999s)]
*  Ali I you know, it's we keep warning about the dire circumstances in Gaza, but you've covered this part of the world [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=715.74s)]
*  What do you think we could be looking at? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=723.86s)]
*  In terms of the situation on the ground in Gaza if this goes forward and we'll get into the US response in a second [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=726.3s)]
*  But just how do we think about the scale of this? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=732.2199999999999s)]
*  I'll give you a personal example of the scale is I was in Gaza in 2019. I met a young woman who [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=734.42s)]
*  Ran a company in which they design little solar chargers, but they have different [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=741.8199999999999s)]
*  Wadages depending on what it is you're charging because Gaza has never had good power, right? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=748.66s)]
*  They don't have normal electricity transmission. They have an electrical plant that is driven by diesel fuel [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=752.62s)]
*  The diesel fuel comes in by truck, but it used to come in by pipe from from Israel [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=757.06s)]
*  So Gaza at the best of times did not have power for many many hours a day and people try and if you get up [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=762.58s)]
*  Too late, you can't have a shower. You can't use your computer [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=768.86s)]
*  You can't use your Wi-Fi so they had this business in which they sold solar chargers if she were in America [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  Ben you and I've I've actually talked to you about her, but you didn't I don't know if you knew the story [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=776.74s)]
*  She she's she's the kind of person who in New York people to be introducing her. She'd be getting financing. She'd have a startup [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=781.1800000000001s)]
*  She'd be doing TED Talks all that kind of stuff she'd be famous she'd be rich [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=788.5s)]
*  Her house is gone. Her family's living in Brooklyn and last week [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=792.46s)]
*  They had a dinner in which people could buy tickets at a GoFundMe to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=796.42s)]
*  To help her family survive [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=801.86s)]
*  This was these were prosperous people who would have been the kind of people who could have taken part in a in a functional government [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=804.22s)]
*  Who could have been a leader? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=811.1s)]
*  I mean, she's the kind of person who could have been the minister of energy or you know, yeah senior and there's nothing left [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=811.86s)]
*  There's no house. There's no business. There's no families all out of Gaza [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=817.38s)]
*  So there's the brain drain but there's this idea that not only are people squeezed into [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=820.58s)]
*  50,000 people to a square mile in in Rafa, which is much greater than the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=825.3000000000001s)]
*  Concentration in in Gaza in general [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=830.46s)]
*  But if they are they are squeezed in there without sanitation getting disease without medical care without heat and without [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=833.0600000000001s)]
*  Without adequate calories, right? This is just it's multiplying [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=840.9s)]
*  It's not just what it is [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=844.54s)]
*  And this is the problem with tragedies that get this bad like Darfur and like Yemen at some point you lose measure of it [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=845.94s)]
*  Because I eat two thousand calories a day [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=853.14s)]
*  there are reports that people there are getting somewhere under 500 calories a day and so we are killing a population so for all of [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=856.1s)]
*  The really legitimate discussions that we are having here and that we're having about college campuses and that we're having about the American [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=864.26s)]
*  In this we have to remember that this is an a man-made [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  Situation that we've got here that aside from being bad because lots of people are going to die [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=877.4599999999999s)]
*  Just think about the solution to this problem over the long term what we are doing to hurt [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=881.4599999999999s)]
*  The idea that there will be people who will ultimately have to come together to make peace so that there can be peace between Israel [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=886.54s)]
*  And Palestine we're not moving closer to that in the things that we've seen in the last few weeks [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=893.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, I remember you telling me better when I actually you were out here [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=897.3s)]
*  I was in studio with you and and and it speaks to kind of that promise that is [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=900.9s)]
*  Just been suffocated among Palestinians both by my Hamas and by Israel in Gaza now [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=905.82s)]
*  You know if you mentioned that there's this kind of exponential escalation in the humanitarian challenge in Gaza [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=913.66s)]
*  we've talked before on this podcast about both the fact that [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=920.0600000000001s)]
*  This is the the most rapid kind of man-made famine we've seen in recent human history [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=924.06s)]
*  To get a population going from not having any family conditions a few months ago to to being in [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=929.66s)]
*  in the precipice of a major famine today and also the reality that that is in violation of [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=935.4599999999999s)]
*  International law essentially there's an obligation even if you're fighting a war [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=941.9s)]
*  You know facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid in now [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=945.78s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why the u.s. Has been so opposed to [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=948.6199999999999s)]
*  A military operation in Rafa and so I want to get to this question of what is the u.s. Do because I mean anybody who listens to me [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=952.26s)]
*  Has known that you know, I've been concerned for months about why is the u.s. Continuing to provide offensive military assistance to [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=959.4200000000001s)]
*  the Israeli government [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=967.4200000000001s)]
*  Our willingness to to continue to veto resolutions [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=969.1800000000001s)]
*  I think all of us have thought that that this roth operation is going to present though some kind of decision point for the Biden [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=972.1800000000001s)]
*  You mentioned there's already been a hold on some offensive weapons including 2,000 pound bombs [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=978.38s)]
*  Biden spoke with Netanyahu as recently as Monday reportedly urged him against attacking Rafa at the same time Biden spoke today [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=984.5s)]
*  on Holocaust Remembrance Day [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=992.5s)]
*  Very strong message against the rise of anti-semitism, which is absolutely necessary in this country [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=995.06s)]
*  Also spoke about the situation in Hamas [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1000.54s)]
*  Also spoke about the situation in Hamas [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1003.62s)]
*  I want to play that clip and then [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1007.02s)]
*  Ask you about the the challenges with us going forward Ali. So we'll play the clip of Biden today people are already forgetting [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1009.22s)]
*  Are already forgetting [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1017.1s)]
*  that Hamas [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1019.42s)]
*  Unleashed this terror. There was some us a brutalized Israelis [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1021.3s)]
*  It was some us [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1026.82s)]
*  Who took and continues the whole hostages? I? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1028.54s)]
*  Have not forgotten or have you and we will not forget now look that's all absolutely true [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1031.98s)]
*  But incomplete, but exactly so because what I was gonna get to is it it kind of [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1038.62s)]
*  It's also the message and Netanyahu would want to hear from the US president on the day that their tanks rolling into Rafa [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1043.98s)]
*  Right that to me is you know, the unavoidable reality here [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1049.82s)]
*  And in the challenge is like Biden is trying to have it both ways [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1054.6999999999998s)]
*  He's trying to kind of deliver this message that expresses his kind of full solidarity with Israel [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1059.26s)]
*  full solidarity with kind of their piece of this narrative about what happened on October 7th and [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1064.58s)]
*  Yet the substance of what's happening on the ground in Gaza is exactly what Biden has said [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1069.82s)]
*  He didn't want to happen, which is the ceasefire talks seem to be unraveling. Hopefully that's not the case [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1074.3s)]
*  Hopefully by the time this podcast airs something [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1079.4s)]
*  Will a rabbit will have been pulled out of a hat? I would like nothing more than for this to be [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1082.42s)]
*  Outdated because that actually happens that would be that would be great [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1087.82s)]
*  but the question I have for you, you know, how do you at what point does can Biden's been trying to straddle this line of [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1091.34s)]
*  rhetorical criticism of Netanyahu, but not really having real consequences and essentially still [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1098.94s)]
*  Taking the Israeli perspective on what's happening in Gaza [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1105.06s)]
*  How does Rafa change that alley? We're not we're not talking about the book just yet [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1109.18s)]
*  But chapter four of my book which is not about this the chapter title is a splinter up your ass [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1113.3s)]
*  And that's what happens when you straddle the fence for too long in the end [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1117.38s)]
*  You don't come up with a solution you think you're you think you're you're balancing yourself, but you're not and that's the problem here because [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1120.78s)]
*  Biden feels a need to say those words and they are important and people should [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1128.02s)]
*  Muslims Jews Christians, everybody should be fighting anti-semitism [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1133.78s)]
*  The people who are anti-semites are not the friends of the rest of us. Anyway, first of all, they're the same people who shoot up [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1136.8200000000002s)]
*  Mosques and synagogues the the the battle against growing anti-semitism [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1142.96s)]
*  Should be something in which we are all joined [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1147.64s)]
*  There have been a lot of people who have gone and muddled this situation though can combine things combined criticism of the state of Israel [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1150.48s)]
*  with anti-semitism, which is an incorrect thing to do and to suggest that [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1157.0s)]
*  That this thing whatever we're in [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1163.0s)]
*  Started on October 7th is just to be contextually absent. That's the problem [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1166.84s)]
*  The problem is yeah [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1172.48s)]
*  Hamas did a horrible horrible thing on October 7th and we need to figure out what justice looks like [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1173.64s)]
*  For Hamas and the perpetrators who committed those acts but nothing started on October 7th [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1179.72s)]
*  We've been talking about this on my little show for two years about the very specific things that are going on in Israel that are [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1185.88s)]
*  Damaging to the Israeli government and damaging to the long-term likelihood of there being peace between these two states [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1192.64s)]
*  Joe Biden I don't know what he's trying to do [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1199.2s)]
*  I I understood in the first couple days and you and I talked in the first couple days after [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1202.24s)]
*  October 8th when I was in Israel, I understood what he was trying to do [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1206.48s)]
*  He was trying to put a hand on Israel's shoulder and say we'll stand with you [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1209.8s)]
*  We've gone through things like this in the past and we've made some bad judgments as a result of having gone through things like this [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1213.96s)]
*  In the past so take some of our guidance on this and don't do that [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1220.3200000000002s)]
*  Not only was Netanyahu not prepared to take that advice [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1224.1s)]
*  But it is not in Netanyahu's interest to take that advice because what? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1227.94s)]
*  Biden was saying is that America got itself into some wars and a lot of people died and spent a lot of money and then we [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1231.58s)]
*  Handed over Afghanistan back to the Taliban and had we known that would we have thought about this differently in the front end possibly [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1236.44s)]
*  But that's not Netanyahu whose political goals are entirely different than America's goals were after 9-eleven [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1242.02s)]
*  And that's part of the problem that Netanyahu was in a very long [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1248.8s)]
*  Battle for his own political survival and now this is it he is staring down the barrel of his own political survival [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1252.9199999999998s)]
*  So his impetus to make a deal [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1260.0s)]
*  It's great when Hamas says things that are not in line with what they need when Hamas says we're agreeing to a deal that [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1262.52s)]
*  Was not the one you actually put together that plays right into [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1268.0s)]
*  Netanyahu's hands because everything that Hamas doesn't do to get a deal makes Netanyahu say there's not going to be a deal [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1271.4799999999998s)]
*  He preempts the deals Hamas preempts the deals [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1278.26s)]
*  Everybody's playing into everybody's hands right now [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1281.6s)]
*  and I do believe actually that Blinken and Austin and Biden are trying trying to get this thing back on trying to get a deal not [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1283.3999999999999s)]
*  Only because the world needs it because there need to be those hostages need to be freed and people need to stop dying [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1292.4599999999998s)]
*  But Joe Biden's got a political problem [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1297.32s)]
*  If he doesn't solve this fairly soon and then starts telling people that I've got them on the law on the road [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1299.52s)]
*  To a two-state solution or at least some kind of sustainable peace in the area. So it's a messy situation [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1303.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, I've I've really tried [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1309.4199999999998s)]
*  To to hear different perspectives on this conflict, you know [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1312.98s)]
*  even in recent days and weeks alley like you I've had a lot of people reach out to me and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1317.02s)]
*  Say, you know, you you've been really, you know, you seem focused on Netanyahu. You've been coming hard on the Israeli government [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1322.2199999999998s)]
*  and and I understand the perspective, you know people say you have to look at it from the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1329.2199999999998s)]
*  perspective of the Israeli people and how they're feeling post-doctor for seventh [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1334.26s)]
*  I understand all of that [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1337.5400000000002s)]
*  As best I can, you know the vulnerability people feel [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1340.8600000000001s)]
*  Certainly the vulnerability that that people feel in this country around rising anti-semitism. I also just I can't ignore [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1344.6200000000001s)]
*  What I see with my eyes, which is a government that at every turn [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1351.6200000000001s)]
*  Whether it's Netanyahu or the kind of even further right [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1357.7s)]
*  Settler factions that are represented in the finance ministry and the National Security Ministry [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1360.98s)]
*  At every turn they have taken the more extreme course of action, you know [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1365.98s)]
*  Whether it was cutting off food and fuel and water into Gaza [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1371.54s)]
*  Whether it's been just continuing to carry out these military operations over the objections of the United States [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1375.3799999999999s)]
*  They're their leading ally that is providing so much military assistance [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1381.32s)]
*  We can't you know, you can't say that you would like this government to be something that it's not right [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1386.42s)]
*  You know, I feel like a lot of Americans who are sympathetic is we're looking at this and kind of keep hoping that [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1393.82s)]
*  More recognizable Israeli government kind of somehow emerges [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1400.34s)]
*  Yes [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1404.1s)]
*  in fact in part because it's Nenya's political survival that is at stake in the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1404.6s)]
*  Continuation of the war and in part because there are some very [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1408.86s)]
*  Extremist factions in this government that want to push the envelope as far as they can [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1411.58s)]
*  In terms of destruction in Gaza and potential displacement Palestinians [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1416.54s)]
*  That's what we're seeing if I see something different that would be great [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1420.02s)]
*  But but we're not seeing that yet now one one other example of this recently was the the shutting down of Al Jazeera [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1424.9399999999998s)]
*  So this past Sunday the Israeli government shut down as Al Jazeera's operations in Israel raided their office in Jerusalem seizing some equipment [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1433.1799999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu is called Al Jazeera a court mouthpiece for Hamas accused of anti-israel bias for years [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1442.26s)]
*  And this was made possible this wasn't just saying that now did though [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1449.14s)]
*  There was a law passed by the Knesset the Israeli Parliament which gave Netanyahu the authority to order the temporary closure of foreign networks [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1452.34s)]
*  now I [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1460.1s)]
*  I'm not asking everybody to be you know Al Jazeera fans here [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1462.66s)]
*  But the reality is there's not a lot of reporting nobody's allowed into Gaza to begin with so the only reporting we get is from [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1466.3s)]
*  Palestinians on the ground kind of use social media [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1472.42s)]
*  Israeli media which is very good, but on this one, you know [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1475.3000000000002s)]
*  I I think it has not been as willing to kind of bring some of the imagery from Gaza into Israeli homes [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1479.54s)]
*  Never mind around the world [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1488.5800000000002s)]
*  All you worked for Al Jazeera like what was your reaction to seeing that? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1491.38s)]
*  Take place and how would you as someone who's kind of? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1496.1000000000001s)]
*  Looked at this from the outside and also once been inside Al Jazeera [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1500.66s)]
*  How should people think about the consequence of doing this? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1503.78s)]
*  So there are a number of things here that are complicated one is [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1506.74s)]
*  Is the one that you identified and that is foreign media cannot get access to Gaza [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1510.9s)]
*  For me is never when I went in in 2019 and other times [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1515.06s)]
*  That my colleagues have gone in you can't go in without the permission of the Israeli government the cooperation of the Israeli government now [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1518.18s)]
*  They they know what i'm going to report. They know how I report [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1524.1000000000001s)]
*  But they have to grant you permission to go in now I was able to go in prior to the war without [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1527.46s)]
*  an Israeli government [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1532.4199999999998s)]
*  Escort, but now foreign governments who go into Gaza foreign journalists go into Gaza go in under the auspices of the IDF [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1534.6599999999999s)]
*  they are basically embedded with the IDF and their product has to be reviewed by the [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1541.3799999999999s)]
*  Israeli censors before they go out [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1546.98s)]
*  So that's just an important piece of information people should know you foreign journalists cannot generate content in Gaza that can be shown [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1548.82s)]
*  Without the interference of the Israeli government number one number two [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1556.42s)]
*  some of the so some of the best reporting meaning the most [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1560.5s)]
*  veteran reporters [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1564.18s)]
*  the finest equipment the most skilled camera operators the people who can go into the most dangerous situations are in the [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1565.86s)]
*  News organizations that exist inside of Gaza staffed by Palestinians [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1574.18s)]
*  The most robust of which is Al Jazeera [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1579.46s)]
*  So whether you like Al Jazeera or what you think it stands for and there is a good debate to be had about that [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1582.18s)]
*  Al Jazeera is is owned by the government of Qatar. Qatar is not a democracy [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1588.5s)]
*  Most Arab non-democracies don't like Al Jazeera, but the people do [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1593.86s)]
*  If you remember when they when the blockade happened on Qatar the number one demand by Saudi Arabia was the dismantling [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1599.3799999999999s)]
*  There were 13 demands and number one was the dismantling of Al Jazeera because they don't want this kind of stuff [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1606.1s)]
*  They don't want the two things that journalism does journalism bears witness for people who cannot be present [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1611.54s)]
*  To see what's going on and then takes the bearing of that witness and holds power to account [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1617.1399999999999s)]
*  Again, whatever one the political views of Al Jazeera are they do that today? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1621.78s)]
*  And they do it to the extent that they have Israelis on tv a lot Israeli officials on tv a lot. In fact, is [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1626.58s)]
*  Al Jazeera has been useful to the Israeli government for a long time because they put their officials on there and they feel that's their [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1633.3s)]
*  Way of getting the message not just to Al Jazeera's english-speaking audience [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1638.98s)]
*  But Al Jazeera's arabic speaking audience and Al Jazeera has never refused to do that [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1642.5s)]
*  So they have engaged in good faith as a journalistic organization in israel in the occupied territories and in gaza [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1647.46s)]
*  But more importantly than what Al Jazeera has done is that israel? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1654.02s)]
*  likes to continue to remind us that it is a democracy even though many people in israel do not enjoy democratic rights, but that they value [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1657.54s)]
*  Freedom of the judiciary which many people have gone out to fight in the last year and a half and freedom of the press [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1665.3s)]
*  And that ended this weekend [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1671.38s)]
*  uh [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1673.46s)]
*  Al Jazeera's shut shuddering means that israel is no longer committed to that basic principle, you know, i'll tell you a story al [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1674.5s)]
*  Ali, I was i've never told this one before but I was uh [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1681.38s)]
*  during the tahrir square protest in egypt in 2011. I remember we'd be in these meetings in the situation room and [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1685.06s)]
*  And our let's just say our officials kept talking about the fact that the egyptian government [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1691.7s)]
*  Was confident that these protests would go away, you know [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1697.22s)]
*  And meanwhile, I was had al jazeera out of my office which had you know, uh scenes from the protest and I kept saying [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1700.18s)]
*  Hey if we relied on you know, i'm watching television guys [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1708.02s)]
*  I'm sure you're talking to officials. I'm sure you have many ways of getting information [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1711.7s)]
*  But like the television screens i'm looking at show people that are not going home, you know [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1714.74s)]
*  Yes, and and and and al jazeera was useful in just broadcasting what was happening, right? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1719.14s)]
*  Yes, I told this story on a panel a few years later and there was a former [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1723.94s)]
*  Uh, very senior israeli intelligence official [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1729.06s)]
*  um, and afterwards he came up to me and he said [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1732.42s)]
*  You know you you fell for a qatari muslim brotherhood [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1735.8600000000001s)]
*  information operation if you were getting your information from al jazeera [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1740.34s)]
*  and I said to him I was like [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1743.94s)]
*  It was it was footage of people in a square it wasn't an information operation, you know, and so sometimes sure [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1745.86s)]
*  I get it. You don't like the agenda of the qatar government. You don't like but but like it's just it is what it is [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1753.54s)]
*  You know, they're there and they're reporting the news. That's that's the part that we have to remember [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1758.8999999999999s)]
*  Um, there are things about al jazeera. I didn't enjoy as an employee, but we had a good arrangement [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1763.4599999999998s)]
*  Don't phone me and I won't phone you. Um [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1768.4199999999998s)]
*  I I work for corporate media. I don't I don't endorse no [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1770.98s)]
*  But nor does anybody ask me to endorse the policies of uh, all of my bosses [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1774.5s)]
*  But we do have to understand that media has a role and when you start banning media as a whole [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1778.9s)]
*  For things that are a bit not clear as it is in israel. It's it's a bad road to go down [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1784.42s)]
*  So one last thing before we move on to other topics. I want to play one clip too, which is related to this [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1789.7s)]
*  Which was mitt romney and tony blinken, uh talking about tik tok. Um the other day [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1794.5s)]
*  uh, we'll play that clip the way this is played on social media [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1800.74s)]
*  has [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1804.5800000000002s)]
*  dominated the uh narrative [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1805.7s)]
*  and you have [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1808.1000000000001s)]
*  a social media ecosystem environment in which [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1809.78s)]
*  context [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1814.24s)]
*  history [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1815.54s)]
*  Facts get lost [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1817.38s)]
*  and the emotion the impact [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1819.38s)]
*  of images [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1822.5s)]
*  Dominates [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1824.74s)]
*  And we can't we can't discount that [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1826.18s)]
*  Um, but I think it also [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1828.9s)]
*  Has a very very very challenging effect on [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1832.42s)]
*  On on the narrative [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1836.42s)]
*  Yeah, a small parenthetical point which is some wonder why there was such overwhelming support [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1837.94s)]
*  for us to shut down potentially tik tok or other entities of that nature if you look at the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1842.74s)]
*  Postings on tik tok and the number of mentions of palestinians relative to other social media sites. It's overwhelmingly so among uh, tik tok [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1848.74s)]
*  um [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1857.3000000000002s)]
*  broadcasts so, you know kind of [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1859.14s)]
*  Saying the quiet part out loud there [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1862.8200000000002s)]
*  Romney basically saying that they banned tik tok because there's too much propel student content [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1865.94s)]
*  What is your what's your response to just the way in which tik tok is is now? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1870.42s)]
*  I mean, there's other concerns obviously about chinese government ownership, but but what's your reaction to that? Yeah [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1874.9s)]
*  Where I agree with mitt romney writ large [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1882.18s)]
*  And he's a guy i've always wanted to agree with more so I try and find things and now I think you know [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1885.78s)]
*  He just put his dog on the top of the roof. He didn't actually shoot his dog [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1889.7s)]
*  Where I agree with him is in general [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1894.26s)]
*  Social media has caused us to speak and think quickly, right? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1896.82s)]
*  It's caused us to have a reaction that's very fast and change your [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1900.26s)]
*  Icons into something and I would love if everybody had some ability to put on [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1904.58s)]
*  On on social media the idea that wow this thing has happened in the middle east [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1909.14s)]
*  I don't really understand it well enough. So i'm going to take some time out to learn about it [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1912.58s)]
*  So, please don't ask me to profess anything until I learn and offer me information if if you can help [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1915.3s)]
*  Tik tok has an algorithm that makes it [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1921.9399999999998s)]
*  More effective than than instagram and and facebook and and x so I get that if you're concerned about the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1925.46s)]
*  The way in which stories get warped [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1933.06s)]
*  Then tik tok is a greater concern, but that concern has to be addressed by our greater sophistication [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1935.6999999999998s)]
*  In figuring out how we small r regulate social media because to the extent that a democracy and we are struggling in america [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1941.16s)]
*  Depends on an informed electorate social media. I in my opinion recently has not been helping to inform that electorate [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1948.6s)]
*  But when he went down that road of its pro-palestinian or whatever the case is and emotions get in the way of whatever emotions [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1955.08s)]
*  Have always gotten in the way of of sober thinking that is the way of the world [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1960.28s)]
*  Um, i'm not sure we should discount the idea that because there are a lot of people on social media who are expressing [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1965.0800000000002s)]
*  Solidarity with or concern for the palestinians that either something's wrong with the algorithm or something's wrong with the people or something's wrong with [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1971.7s)]
*  With the way it goes. Yes, there are issues with social media. Yes. Some of them are exacerbated by tik tok [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1977.96s)]
*  And no, it's very much like college campuses at some point. Maybe they're actually protesting for something [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1983.72s)]
*  Maybe you need to stop discounting the fact that the system's all broken [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1988.44s)]
*  Maybe maybe listen to what it is the folks on tik tok are actually saying [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1991.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's a that's very well said and and frankly, you know the the concern about tik tok would would be more credible if there was a [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=1995.32s)]
*  Complimentary effort to try to regulate the way in which american social media platforms have broken people's brains around the world [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2002.8999999999999s)]
*  It's not it's not not dangerous. It's a it's a real thing [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2009.08s)]
*  But you can't make it dangerous just for the reasons you want it to be dangerous, right? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2011.72s)]
*  It's like the ai conversation [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2015.0s)]
*  You're really gonna like some ai when it solves that cancer that you haven't been able to solve for a long time [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2016.4399999999998s)]
*  But you're not going to like it when it takes your job [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2021.4799999999998s)]
*  So we have to have a more holistic view of how we look at technology in particular [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2023.0s)]
*  But but social media specifically this that was a weak argument. That was weak t. All right. Well shifting gears here. Um [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2027.1599999999999s)]
*  Right now, uh chinese president xi Jinping is making his first visit to europe in five years [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2034.6s)]
*  Um, so since before covid this is a big deal. Um [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2040.12s)]
*  And he's going to an interesting collection of countries france hungary and serbia [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2043.96s)]
*  I think we can say, you know hungary obviously orban has been much more willing to look towards [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2051.08s)]
*  china and russia [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2056.52s)]
*  than the united states [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2058.28s)]
*  serbia [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2060.52s)]
*  A huge trading partner for china also [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2061.48s)]
*  It's the 25th anniversary of nato bombing the chinese embassy in belgrade. So [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2064.36s)]
*  Xi Jinping making a point there. I think probably about [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2070.28s)]
*  china's suspicions about nato [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2073.4799999999996s)]
*  But most interesting to me is france because it's not surprising why she would go to hungary and serbia [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2075.3999999999996s)]
*  Um, what's interesting about this is that? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2081.08s)]
*  At the same time that you've had europe [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2083.72s)]
*  Kind of wrestling with how much to go along with america's china policy [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2086.7599999999998s)]
*  And you've had china wanting I think, you know peel off the europeans from the united states [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2090.8399999999997s)]
*  Emanuel mccrone has become more outspoken and gave a big interview in the economist this week about the need for europe to kind of [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2095.9599999999996s)]
*  Chart its own course on military spending on russia on [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2101.8s)]
*  technology [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2106.02s)]
*  Um ali you used to you're as smart as anyone [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2107.4s)]
*  I know everybody knows you for covering american politics now and the issues we've been talking about but you were really [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2109.8s)]
*  Good on on global economy on markets and and obviously this is a huge issue. Yeah, um this question of [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2114.6s)]
*  Of how does the france or how does a europe engage china? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2121.88s)]
*  Um, what do you think xi Jinping is trying to accomplish? What do you think emmanuel mccrone is trying to accomplish? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2125.56s)]
*  And and what should be the view from the united states as as we watch this kind of mutual charm offensive between g and mccrone [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2130.92s)]
*  Well on the old guard of oacd slash nato leaders mccrone is that guy now, right? I mean [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2137.96s)]
*  Justra trudeau still exists, but but fundamentally, uh, most of those leaders are gone [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  And so there are meaningful discussions going on in europe right now, particularly out of fear of donald trump winning the election [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2152.1200000000003s)]
*  Again and a further weakening of nato and what happens to ukraine if if donald trump comes into office [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2158.92s)]
*  So I think there's a there's a real sense amongst the europeans about what are our ways forward? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2165.32s)]
*  economically and militarily what does nato look like what do our alliances need to look like and she [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2172.1s)]
*  Uh ends up looking in the world like somebody who is not [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2178.12s)]
*  He's you know, he's always been able to distinguish himself from kim jong-un [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2182.36s)]
*  You know, she is a thoughtful man who sort of planned out his his future and he's been able to distinguish himself [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2186.1200000000003s)]
*  Uh from vladimir putin he's not going to be reckless [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2191.88s)]
*  So there were a lot of people who thought in the early days of the ukraine war that perhaps she will take that opportunity to go [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2195.0800000000004s)]
*  Into taiwan and I think he's looked at the world and he said whatever your view of of joe biden and how he's handled [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2200.36s)]
*  Many things are he got the world aligned against russia china can't afford that [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2206.36s)]
*  We can't the world can't afford it and china can't afford it, right? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2210.92s)]
*  The world can afford to be at war with russia russia doesn't sell us much that we need [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2213.16s)]
*  Uh, and and we don't you know that trade relationship is not all that important other than oil [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2217.16s)]
*  Uh, that's not the case with china [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2222.68s)]
*  So she has to have a very sophisticated view and if the if the europeans are being forced to think about peeling away from the united states [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2224.44s)]
*  Because they might get forced to by a second trump administration [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2232.2799999999997s)]
*  It it sort of behooves him to be in france and it behooves france to talk to him [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2237.24s)]
*  I kind of get it [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2242.76s)]
*  It's the I don't know what the world order is going to look like if donald trump becomes the next president of the united states [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2243.88s)]
*  so I need to start shoring up my [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2249.48s)]
*  You know my my other options and I think that's what that is. That's an other option conversation about trade about [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2251.96s)]
*  Energy and about military stuff if you don't have the united states by your side all the time [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2258.9s)]
*  If you cannot trust that they will stand by your side and your europe you need options kind of weird in 2024 that [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2264.44s)]
*  China might be that option, but it's popped its head up a lot in the last 15 years, right when greece had its its [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2271.08s)]
*  Debt problems china was there in a second china shows up very fast [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2277.64s)]
*  When someone is having doubts about what their economic future is going to look like and they will alleviate it by building you [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2281.7999999999997s)]
*  Ports and doing all sorts of things so [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2287.72s)]
*  China is super sophisticated and I think that is one of those things that we've got to understand [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2290.44s)]
*  We like to see the world as black and white you can't with china china is both [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2295.3199999999997s)]
*  Ally and adversary at the same time. Yeah, I I think that's well said and we should note you know hungary and serbia [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2299.96s)]
*  Also a part of the belt road initiative [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2305.2400000000002s)]
*  the chinese-led [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2307.8s)]
*  Initiative, I i'm sure one of the things that mcrone is going to be talking about is ukraine and trying [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2309.0s)]
*  You know probably futilely to to get china to reduce its support for russia [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2315.16s)]
*  As we're talking today, there's a number of developments which I think kind of speak to [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2319.64s)]
*  russian confidence in the war in ukraine, so [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2324.12s)]
*  Putin is being inaugurated for his fifth term as president in a shocking election result that he won that election [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2327.32s)]
*  In his speech which comes shortly before victory day in russia the the commemoration of the victory in world war two [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2334.12s)]
*  You know, he once again talked about western aggression and attempts to contain russia [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2340.44s)]
*  And again as I said in a couple days, he'll be marking [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2345.96s)]
*  The soviet union's victory over nazi germany as a part of this whole pageantry [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2348.92s)]
*  The washington post recently had a good report about a month-long exhibit that is taking place in moscow [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2354.86s)]
*  Displaying military equipment that they've captured from the west in the war in ukraine [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2361.5s)]
*  So a bit of a sign of some, you know, maybe premature triumphalism [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2366.22s)]
*  and [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2370.46s)]
*  There has also been reports [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2371.58s)]
*  In the last day or so about [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2373.74s)]
*  A potential assassination plot where two colonels in the ukrainian military were arrested for their alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2376.38s)]
*  President zelensky of ukraine the new york times report on this [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2383.82s)]
*  Which included trying to recruit people close to his security detail so they could kidnap and eventually kill zelensky [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2387.26s)]
*  So we you know, we have to obviously pull the thread on these allegations [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2392.38s)]
*  To me the kind of common thread of all this alley is that you know [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2396.38s)]
*  Here's prudence feels that he's in pretty good position, right? He's he's kind of on the offensive in ukraine. He's displaying war trophies [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2399.34s)]
*  You know, maybe he's trying fanciful plots to to to once again to capture the ukrainian government [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2406.06s)]
*  Um, you were you know, you've reported on the ground in ukraine, uh, very powerfully. So you've watched this work closely [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2411.9s)]
*  You've seen the momentum ebb and flow [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2418.3s)]
*  Um, what I mean part of me kind of thinks maybe the russians are now they're over [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2420.7000000000003s)]
*  The ukrainians were a little overconfident a year ago. Maybe it's the russians today [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2424.94s)]
*  What's your kind of sense of the mood music you're seeing out of moscow? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2428.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, let's put a few more data points on that last year was a really bad year for vladimir putin, right? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2431.34s)]
*  It was a really bad year the the the prugosian stuff [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2436.5400000000004s)]
*  Um the you know the the facts on the ground in ukraine is while we describe it as being a relative stalemate [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2439.9s)]
*  Um on land it's not on water [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2446.78s)]
*  Uh, the the the black sea fleet is mostly on the east end of the black sea [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2449.42s)]
*  They don't they don't the russians don't control that and they still don't have air superiority over over ukraine [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2454.54s)]
*  Which is kind of amazing now the ukrainians still don't have uh, they're not flying the planes that um, they've been promised [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2460.14s)]
*  They're not you know, they're not up in the air [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2465.66s)]
*  But I remember when the first hypersonic missiles went into ukraine and we weren't sure that the that our our patriot missiles could could intercept them [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2467.02s)]
*  And they could uh with remarkable accuracy now [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2476.06s)]
*  They've got a lot of tricks they can send lots and lots of drones to confuse the missiles you end up spending [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2478.38s)]
*  You know millions of dollars to intercept a 20 or 40 thousand dollar drone [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2484.22s)]
*  So, you know russia's not done and russia's got iran behind it [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2488.22s)]
*  Helping it out helping it out and it's not clear where china is on this way [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2492.14s)]
*  You know if china decides to really put its its thumb on the scale in favor of russia in that war things can change [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2495.4199999999996s)]
*  that said [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2501.8999999999996s)]
*  They're also trying to recruit women into the military not because they feel that they want a more uh, equitable military [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2503.3399999999997s)]
*  It's because they're running out of people. So I don't know. I don't I think putin does this [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2508.2999999999997s)]
*  He's able to he knows what works and what doesn't work [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2513.74s)]
*  So what doesn't work is his nuclear saber rattling even the nuclear people don't care anymore [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2516.62s)]
*  They say that he's just talking about nonsense. Um, he he does need to shore up things at home. He won this election [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2520.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh, navalny is dead [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2527.18s)]
*  Vladimir karamurza is in jail just won a Pulitzer prize two days ago for some of his writing [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2529.42s)]
*  He needs to shore things up at home [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2535.5s)]
*  Uh, and I think we've heard from from zelensky that people are getting tired in ukraine. This is hard [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2537.5s)]
*  It's hard to fight this war we hear about [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2543.9s)]
*  The things we hear about what you don't hear about is that civilians continue to die people are maimed people have lost body parts [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2546.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, they they they think toward a future that involves, uh ukraine in nato [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2552.22s)]
*  But it's moving very slowly and all vladimir putin has to do [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2558.22s)]
*  Is wait until donald trump gets elected if he thinks donald trump's going to get elected because the pressure on him [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2562.46s)]
*  Dies there will not be him. It's not just nato. It's a 50 nation [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2569.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh consortium that is working to defend ukraine [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2573.26s)]
*  Donald trump's not going to be interested in that loyd austin who's been holding that together [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2577.82s)]
*  There won't be a loyd austin [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2580.94s)]
*  So I think at the moment vladimir putin is trying to look really strong [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2582.38s)]
*  he's trying to keep spirits up in his country and he's trying to keep this war going at the [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2585.82s)]
*  Lowest possible level for the next several months to see how things work out with donald trump because if donald trump does does win [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2589.98s)]
*  You could see the end of that war and not in a good way [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2598.3s)]
*  Yeah time time is kind of not working for anybody at this point [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2600.7799999999997s)]
*  Uh, but but putin probably feels like it's uh, he's got at least some chips and on our election [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2604.62s)]
*  Well one more thing before we get to your book another assassination of sorts and another [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2610.06s)]
*  Story of autocracy of sorts. We followed this in the podcast [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2615.1s)]
*  But canadian police have now arrested three suspects who believed to have ties to the indian government's [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2617.74s)]
*  Uh efforts to murder, uh successful efforts to murder six separatist leader [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2623.74s)]
*  Hardip singh nijar last june in vancouver [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2628.86s)]
*  India has accused nijar of terrorism but denied involvement in his death. So this is kind of moving through the legal process [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2632.38s)]
*  Um, you know and this we will get this kind of transitions in a way into your book ali you've you know, you have a history [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2639.1s)]
*  Obviously in your family back into india indigujarat actually the state where modi [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2646.06s)]
*  Uh comes from um [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2650.3s)]
*  What's it like to watch this you you you know, you grew up in canada you have indian heritage [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2652.62s)]
*  So you kind of encompass both identities. Um, yeah, it's a very strange. This is a very story [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2657.82s)]
*  Yeah, so what's it like just for you to watch this? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2662.78s)]
*  As a canadian and an indian in some respects the main takeaway here is that [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2665.98s)]
*  Canada has decided to stand up to modi and modi is not liking that at all and there's a massive indian diaspora [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2670.94s)]
*  In canada, which my family is a part, uh, which the Sikh population by the way [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2677.42s)]
*  Were one of the earliest most most indians came to canada the way my family did you went from [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2681.7400000000002s)]
*  You went somewhere from india to africa or the west indies and then you moved your way up into canada [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2687.82s)]
*  The six came as part of the group that included the chinese and the japanese to build the railways [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2692.6200000000003s)]
*  On the western united states and western canada [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2698.0600000000004s)]
*  So they've been here earlier and longer to the point that if you go to british columbia [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2700.0600000000004s)]
*  Which is where the majority of the population or at least their population centers are [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2703.5800000000004s)]
*  You'll see six in [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2707.34s)]
*  Not just in service jobs, but in government [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2709.18s)]
*  As premiers as as senior government ministers and things like that [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2711.98s)]
*  And one of the things I write about in my book is when you're indian diaspora [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2715.8199999999997s)]
*  Once you're out there some of the fights that go on at home don't seem as as clear because you're kind of [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2718.7799999999997s)]
*  brown people in this larger white people mass, but there have been tensions between [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2723.58s)]
*  Uh some groups of six who are still seeking [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2728.54s)]
*  Independence and and separate uh land in in india and the indian government [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2732.22s)]
*  That is not reflective of the majority of hindus and seeks but you've got an indian government that is becoming more [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2737.2599999999998s)]
*  Uh ultra nationalist hindu to the exclusion of both six and muslims [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2743.0s)]
*  And you've got this intrigue that by the way is also going on in the united states and there is yeah [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2747.66s)]
*  As you know, we have great difficulty [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2752.46s)]
*  In particularly moody is one of those guys we have very great difficulty with there are things [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2754.62s)]
*  We should be telling him about democracy about russia about things that he should be doing [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2758.8599999999997s)]
*  And we don't we hold state dinners for him in the united states [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2764.3799999999997s)]
*  So that's the contrast you're seeing that we are still holding the equivalent of state dinners for for niranjimodi [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2767.1s)]
*  And canada has decided that they are going to charge uh people and and and make this seem like it was a crime [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2772.94s)]
*  That it was that was fostered by the government of india. So [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2778.54s)]
*  All sorts of problems all over the place. This is a major major diplomatic issue [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2781.8999999999996s)]
*  Um, some in canada say that trudeau should not have stepped into this [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2786.06s)]
*  But [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2790.22s)]
*  There are pressures to say justice is justice and we're not letting other people [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2791.1s)]
*  Come on to our land and and and undergo a set undertake a fascination [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2795.66s)]
*  So I I don't know how this one's going to fold and unfold but it's a tricky one [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2799.5s)]
*  Well, I I applaud trudeau for just playing it straight, you know, sometimes the facts are facts and you gotta let them that's how he's [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2802.94s)]
*  Now look, let's get into your book here directly. Um, so it's an incredible story [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2810.14s)]

*  uh with your family and and I just wanted to ask you to tell the story about [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2863.1s)]
*  Gandhi literally carrying your young grandfather on his shoulders. Um [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2867.7400000000002s)]
*  Uh [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2872.1400000000003s)]
*  And the impact that gandhi had on not just your grandfather, but your your whole kind of family ethos and mentality [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2873.5s)]
*  So my great grandfather and gandhi were both gudjarathis [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2879.42s)]
*  But they didn't know each other in south africa [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2882.86s)]
*  But because they were gudjarathis and gandhi was a lawyer my my great grandfather was a small businessman [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2884.86s)]
*  They both needed a bookkeeper and they shared a gudjarathi bookkeeper who then introduced them and they became friends gandhi lived in johannesburg [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2890.3s)]
*  My great grandfather lived in pretoria and in gandhi's agitation of the government [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2897.8199999999997s)]
*  He had to have frequent meetings with government officials [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2901.4199999999996s)]
*  So he would come to pretoria to stay with my great grandfather who had a what was called a drei [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2903.58s)]
*  It was a horse-drawn cart [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2908.46s)]
*  Um, not the kind for fancy driving around but for moving goods, but he would give gandhi the use of this drei to go to his government meetings [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2910.46s)]
*  Um, anyway, my great grandfather wasn't particularly political like many indian business people in the diaspora [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2917.66s)]
*  Their view was let's not get involved in politics and rock the boat. We're doing okay here sending some money home [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2924.06s)]
*  Let's leave it at that gandhi wanted everybody involved in the struggle [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2928.78s)]
*  And so he says to my great grandfather one day may I take your son who was seven years old at the time? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2932.54s)]
*  To my school and school by the way, I say very loosely [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2939.1s)]
*  It's an ashram. It was a commune and the point was he wanted to toughen people up generally speaking indians [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2941.98s)]
*  He wanted them toughened up for the ability to fight apartheid and face the consequences of fighting apartheid [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2947.1800000000003s)]
*  Which typically meant going to jail [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2952.86s)]
*  So my great grandfather looks at gandhi and figures out he's got a way out of this. He says we are muslims [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2955.02s)]
*  You're a hindu [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2961.26s)]
*  How can my son how can I send my son in his formative years to to go to? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2962.38s)]
*  Live with you and and learn your ways and he said I will learn your religion to teach it to him [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2966.54s)]
*  So he did so my grandfather at the age of seven became gandhi's youngest student on this ashram where they [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2971.02s)]
*  They had two blankets you slept on one because it was hard floors and you had one on top of you. No hot water [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2977.1800000000003s)]
*  No meat you grew everything that you you ate and the point was to be hardened so that you would become you could break laws break [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2982.86s)]
*  Break apartheid laws and go to jail because if you grow up with that kind of a spartan existence [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2989.6600000000003s)]
*  Jail doesn't trouble you and that's how but but they would they couldn't take public transit [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2995.1s)]
*  They had to walk everywhere and my grandfather being the youngest would sometimes get tired on these 20 mile walks [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=2999.98s)]
*  so gandhi would put him on his shoulders and uh and and and take him to you know [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3004.78s)]
*  Get the provisions that the farm needed and things like that and that you know that lasted three years gandhi left [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3009.66s)]
*  South africa interestingly enough thinking he had failed [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3015.02s)]
*  And my grandfather took the lessons that he learned and made it part of the family ethos as the family businesses [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3017.8999999999996s)]
*  Prospered over the years and they sort of funneled money from the businesses and did things within the business that allowed them to fight apartheid [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3024.6s)]
*  In their small ways because nobody was trying to overthrow the whole government [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3032.14s)]
*  They were all even gandhi was trying to get like martin luther king trying to get particular laws [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3035.66s)]
*  Overthrown and particular things done, but that has infused my family's view [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3040.12s)]
*  Not just of social justice and of liberty and equality but also of pluralism, right? [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3044.46s)]
*  My grandfather was taught his own religion by a hindu who had studied [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3049.02s)]
*  Jewish scriptures and christian scriptures and hindu scriptures and muslim scriptures [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3053.74s)]
*  So we grew up in this world that said those are not differences that are important to us. Those are just [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3057.5s)]
*  Elements of pluralism that make us more interesting to one another. Yeah. Well, and then you you talk about, you know [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3063.02s)]
*  being in canada growing up [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3069.6600000000003s)]
*  and it sounds like you know, the [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3072.3s)]
*  you know this very [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3074.86s)]
*  diverse pluralistic environment in your household too, you know taking in [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3077.02s)]
*  refugees and [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3081.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, how did you? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3083.34s)]
*  You're obviously in a minority population in some respects in a diaspora population [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3085.26s)]
*  In a place like toronto and at the same time it it feels like there was a really concerted effort to kind of infuse your [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3090.22s)]
*  Your household with a sense of both [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3096.7s)]
*  um an obligation and commitment to pluralism and then ultimately then that evolves into a commitment to public service, but [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3098.86s)]
*  But just how did those early years shape you? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3106.06s)]
*  Were you how I mean? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3108.62s)]
*  What was it like to revisit that in your writing and and how did what did it imprint on you? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3110.38s)]
*  Well, it was it was it was real [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3115.1s)]
*  It's not one of those things then when you write a book about your your own history your family's history [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3116.78s)]
*  You color some things in a little bit right you to to make them stand out [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3120.6200000000003s)]
*  But that part didn't need coloring in that was clear to me as a kid [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3124.2200000000003s)]
*  It was clear to me. We were a little different from the sort of waspy [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3129.1000000000004s)]
*  Neighbors that we had who were all fantastic just weren't like us [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3132.3s)]
*  They they went to different places and did different things [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3136.1400000000003s)]
*  But it was clear that my family was different otherwise and the difference was driven by the fact that my father my mother and my sister [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3138.94s)]
*  Were all born in places in which they could not participate in politics by virtue of the color of their skin [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3144.46s)]
*  They could not vote. Yeah, and so they were so determined to a not only get involved in politics [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3149.34s)]
*  So they show up in canada and they attend meetings of all three major political parties [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3154.54s)]
*  To try and figure out what their comfort they they didn't go in on the on the basis of ideology [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3158.94s)]
*  They wanted to go and say what does this feel like? How do they how do they what do they think of us? [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3163.42s)]
*  How does this how might we participate? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3167.1s)]
*  But mostly my my parents never wanted to live in a world again where people are separated or judged by the color of their skin [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3169.66s)]
*  Or their their their ethnicity or their race [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3177.1s)]
*  They wanted to mix they wanted our house to be a place where everybody met with everybody [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3180.22s)]
*  It's in the smallest scale. I mean we were we were we were low-income immigrants. It wasn't like we were having [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3185.58s)]
*  Diplomatic parties, but but it's it's as if we were we they we we had all sorts coming through the house [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3190.54s)]
*  And finally 10 years into this adventure in canada. My dad says he wants to run for office [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3195.82s)]
*  Yeah, I was gonna ask you. I mean, what's that like to have your dad run for office? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3199.98s)]
*  I was sitting on the floor. I remember the the living room probably a small room and I was sitting on the floor [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3203.42s)]
*  And he told everybody this and they were all good people [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3208.1400000000003s)]
*  I mean he gathered the sort of smartest people he knew and they said you're never gonna win you can't win [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3210.94s)]
*  Uh, he said well, we won't know will we until we try he said [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3216.6200000000003s)]
*  We don't we know we don't win but we don't try so how would we know that we can't win if we did try? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3220.46s)]
*  And he wanted to and his whole point was that back home. They would have jailed me for this [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3225.34s)]
*  Okay, that would have been a subversive meeting somebody in that room would have been a snitch and they the the special branch of the police [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3229.7400000000002s)]
*  Would be on top of you and you'd be arrested for being a communist sympathizer. That's how it worked in in south africa [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3235.6600000000003s)]
*  In canada, he's saying why don't we try it and see if it works? So i'm 11 years old. I'm game, right? I'm [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3240.7000000000003s)]
*  Fantastic knocking on school. Yeah, it's great. We get all the way to the end of the election [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3246.1200000000003s)]
*  It's it's uh election night my dad wants to change he's been in the same sort of outfit all day [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3251.3399999999997s)]
*  Wants to change into the suit for election night. So I zip home with him and we get in the car. It's eight o'clock polls close and [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3255.5s)]
*  We weren't really worried about that because how can the you know, how the results are going to be known at eight o'clock [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3263.3399999999997s)]
*  But it's eight o'clock. We're about 10 minutes from the campaign office turn on the radio [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3267.74s)]
*  It says polls are closed too early to tell what the results are except in this one constituency that my dad ran in [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3271.8999999999996s)]
*  they they were able to declare at [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3278.3799999999997s)]
*  30 seconds after the hour [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3280.94s)]
*  Incumbent had been elected [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3283.26s)]
*  My father was was defeated because it was that obvious. I didn't know anything about polling and advanced polling and exit poll [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3284.62s)]
*  I didn't know anything about this stuff [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3289.58s)]
*  So I would shock I look at my dad. I said, I can't believe we lost he said, of course we lost [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3291.1s)]
*  I said, why do we do this if we're going to lose? He said we did it because we could [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3295.98s)]
*  Because tomorrow life goes on nobody gets arrested [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3299.1s)]
*  I I put my ideology out there for people to vote for they voted for the other guy [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3301.9s)]
*  It's all good walks into the campaign office everybody claps for him. I'm thinking what are you people clapping about? We lost [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3306.94s)]
*  Goes in the back calls his opponent [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3312.46s)]
*  The concession speech the concession phone call takes about a minute and that's the end of it [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3314.54s)]
*  And that's the end of it [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3319.5s)]
*  And and and the funny part is that my father ran again and won and that's not the interesting part of the story [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3320.38s)]
*  The interesting part is I learned more about how he about politics from how he lost [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3325.66s)]
*  Well, and this journey kind of continues, right? So we've got from india to south africa then up to kenya to canada [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3329.98s)]
*  Into politics and then you know your journey, uh, you know at the end of the book you you talk about your journey to kind of becoming american [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3336.7s)]
*  Uh, which is traces this kind of crazy period of history that i've been in public life, right? You drive your motorcycle in manhattan shortly after 9 11 [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3345.1s)]
*  um [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3352.94s)]
*  And and you've kind of lived this two decades, uh becoming a journalist too, you know famously [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3353.98s)]
*  Reporting on the george florid protest and getting shot in the leg with a rubber bullet. I mean [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3360.3s)]
*  How did you in and reflecting on this in the book? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3365.1s)]
*  Uh, how did you digest the the highs and lows of your your journey to to americanness? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3368.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh during this very crazy period in history [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3374.62s)]
*  Well, it corresponds to me realizing that I grew up with a certain privilege. My family didn't have right [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3377.8199999999997s)]
*  They they had a drive in them that was about the fact that something was unequal. They were born into inequality [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3383.3399999999997s)]
*  I wasn't really I was born into [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3390.06s)]
*  Post independence kenya which in theory was a a free society a free democracy a new democracy [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3392.7s)]
*  And then I grew up in canada, which is a a free [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3398.46s)]

*  I I didn't realize the degree to which [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3407.02s)]
*  Our citizenship comes with a series of obligations not just rights [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3410.7s)]
*  The reason I wasn't interested in taking on american citizenship is because I didn't need any more rights, right? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3414.38s)]
*  I i've got canadian citizenship. I've got all these passports. What more do I possibly need out of this thing? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3418.7s)]
*  It's not about what you need [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3423.42s)]
*  It's about what it is you do to make this thing feel like a more fair society [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3424.94s)]
*  My father got involved in politics as did my mother after that and my sister [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3429.5s)]
*  All of them got involved in in electoral politics because they felt that they owed an obligation to the place that finally [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3433.8199999999997s)]
*  Gave them a home in which they were welcomed and now i'm realizing that we all have to do that [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3440.2999999999997s)]
*  We don't all have to run for office, uh far from it [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3445.58s)]
*  But if we can look at the society and say some things are unequal unequal like for instance today [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3448.8599999999997s)]
*  Reproductive rights are unequal in america. I'm not enjoying my full democracy if everybody else around me is not [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3453.7999999999997s)]
*  And I go back to south africa and I think to myself for the five percent of people who voted in south africa all throughout apartheid [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3460.62s)]
*  They had a wonderful democracy democracy worked for them. They got to pick their prime minister every four years. It was fantastic [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3466.22s)]
*  But we can't look at it that way. We've got to look at it and say until it's all fair [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3472.38s)]
*  It's not fair and that was what woke me up [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3477.58s)]
*  That that covering george floyd and many other things since then have woken me up the idea that I can't just pretend to be a journalist [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3480.62s)]
*  In a completely fixed and fair democracy. I have to remember that there is work to be done [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3487.02s)]
*  And maybe there will always be work to be done ben. This may not be a problem [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3492.06s)]
*  It may just be the the nature of the beast that there's always work to be done to keep bad impulses at bay [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3495.9s)]
*  We see it in hungary. We see it in turkey. We see it in india [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3501.02s)]
*  We see it in russia. There are bad impulses that have to be kept at bay and it's our job as citizens to do that [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3503.34s)]
*  Well, I want to ask you one last thing. Uh, you know at the end of this book you you describe [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3508.78s)]
*  going to [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3514.86s)]
*  uh tolstoy farm, uh [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3516.1400000000003s)]
*  This this place in south africa that is so central to [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3518.54s)]
*  Your family's history with gandhi [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3522.1400000000003s)]
*  And not just going there but kind of retracing the footsteps that gandhi used to take [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3524.78s)]
*  I question I wanted to ask you about this is [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3529.1000000000004s)]
*  You know you're in the you're in the churn, right? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3531.66s)]
*  I mean I pop up on your shows now and then and you're not you're not just hosting valshy. You're kind of [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3534.2999999999997s)]
*  You're you're omnipresent. You're popping up on msnbc in other countries. You're you're in the middle of politics [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3539.66s)]
*  You're in the middle of of all these world events [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3544.94s)]
*  And i'm just curious both the experience of writing a book as you said is can be laborious. I'm on my third now [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3547.8199999999997s)]
*  but I was curious what was it like to just take a pause and take that trip to south africa and [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3553.42s)]
*  Retrace those footsteps and kind of stand in this place [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3559.18s)]
*  You know so far away from washington dc or all these other places [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3562.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, what was that like for you to kind of step out of your life and step back in your family's history that way? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3566.8599999999997s)]
*  It was amazing to me [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3571.8199999999997s)]
*  It not only because if you if maybe we'll go one day you can stand where my grandfather stood on that farm [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3573.4199999999996s)]
*  And you can see johannesburg and you can see nothing in between in other words [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3580.06s)]
*  It's what he would have seen there is stuff in between it just the way the land [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3583.2599999999998s)]
*  Curves you you see none of the development so you almost are looking at what my grandfather may have seen [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3587.18s)]
*  A hundred years ago the difference is what you see in joannesburg now are buildings [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3592.06s)]
*  But what he saw would have been smokestacks [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3595.34s)]
*  He would have seen the the idea that there was a city there [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3597.2599999999998s)]
*  So it was amazing to actually look back because I was trying to say what did my young grandfather think about the world? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3599.74s)]
*  He was separated from his family. Um, what was he learning? Was he thinking he was going to change the world? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3605.5s)]
*  and that's sort of my point that [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3610.62s)]
*  You never know you're going to change the world something I write about in the book is my grandfather died at the age of 58 [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3612.94s)]
*  He thought he had failed too [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3618.62s)]
*  Right. He thought it was over. He thought it hadn't worked. He didn't know his children would get to canada [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3620.38s)]
*  Didn't know his son would get elected to office. He didn't know his daughter-in-law would be a candidate for office [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3625.02s)]
*  he didn't know his his uh [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3630.06s)]
*  Granddaughter would be a multi endorsed candidate for office [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3632.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean my sister didn't win her election, but certainly should have she didn't know i'd be he didn't know i'd be me [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3636.46s)]
*  So the point is these small acts of courage these things you do they don't have to bear fruit for you immediately [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3642.06s)]
*  They don't have to you don't have to sit in the shade of the the the tree that you planted [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3647.98s)]
*  Someone will and and and that's largely what that message meant to me as I retraced his steps [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3652.46s)]
*  I realized that gandhi and my grandfather and others had worked so hard to change a world that they never saw [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3657.74s)]
*  Change the way they wanted it to and yet the world [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3663.8199999999997s)]
*  Did change and so today I think about the same thing I think it looks it looks hard out there [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3667.58s)]
*  It looks daunting [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3672.54s)]
*  But this world too can change it can change in the right way and it can change because of little things you do [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3673.58s)]
*  That you don't even realize the impact of okay [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3678.54s)]
*  So obviously uh for the last several years women's reproductive rights have been under attack here in the united states [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3681.18s)]
*  Uh will be a huge issue in this election in the united states, but it's not just an issue here [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3686.86s)]
*  Um, it's also an issue around the world including in europe [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3692.22s)]
*  And i'm really really happy to welcome to pot say the world my friend nika kovac [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3695.7400000000002s)]
*  Who is a slovenian activist and director of the research institute of march 8th about her campaign to protect abortion access across europe [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3700.78s)]
*  So nika, thanks so much for joining us from slovenia [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3708.78s)]
*  Yeah, thank so you are one of the leaders of a campaign called my voice my choice [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3711.1000000000004s)]
*  And so let's just start by asking you [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3716.94s)]
*  What is the campaign about what are you trying to accomplish? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3719.7400000000002s)]
*  In the upcoming european parliamentary elections in june. Yeah, so basically the state of abortion in europe is also urgent [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3723.3399999999997s)]
*  In poland women still die in hospitals in malta if you do an abortion you go for three years to prison [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3731.2599999999998s)]
*  In austria abortion is part of penal code. So doctors need to learn it on papayas [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3738.8599999999997s)]
*  and 20 million women doesn't have the access to abortion [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3745.18s)]
*  And in one moment we started to think when we saw what happened with you guys in us [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3749.5s)]
*  That we need to protect abortion on european level and because politicians and bureaucrats don't do this [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3755.42s)]
*  We decided to take things in our own hands. So we proposed an european citizen initiative [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3762.46s)]
*  Which is basically establishing a mechanism which is allowing women to go to countries where? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3768.86s)]
*  Abortion is legal and do it there on the costs of european union. We need to collect one million signatures [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3776.22s)]
*  We are doing it for 10 days. We have [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3783.8999999999996s)]
*  140 000 of them. It's the fastest growing initiative and our plan is to do this till european elections [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3787.16s)]
*  And and you've I mean we saw some success in france, right and codifying abortion rights [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3794.54s)]
*  I mean what would what would success look like for your campaign, you know getting those million signatures and [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3800.38s)]
*  And what kind of momentum you're trying to generate? Yeah [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3806.54s)]
*  So basically like the first moment is yes to collect the signatures [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3809.1s)]
*  We keep saying that in every european country the support for abortion is more than 60 percent [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3813.6600000000003s)]
*  And the second fact which is connected with with our campaign is that we are also inviting people to go and to vote on european elections [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3820.3s)]
*  Because about our initiative the next european parliament will be deciding and there is a huge threat of far right [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3829.26s)]
*  And we are saying to the people like these elections are also about reproductive rights [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3836.6200000000003s)]
*  So please vote for the candidates who are supporting our initiative and success for us would be double [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3841.7400000000002s)]
*  So firstly to collect the signatures and secondly to elect politicians who will actually support the initiative and who will [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3848.46s)]
*  Allow that europe changes their approach to the abortion. So in the u.s. Obviously, this is a very partisan issue [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3857.4199999999996s)]
*  We see the rise of a number of far-right parties across europe as you're heading into the european parliamentary elections [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3866.62s)]
*  I think there's been some concerns that the far-right [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3873.4199999999996s)]
*  Might make gains [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3876.2999999999997s)]
*  um [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3877.74s)]
*  How how political is the issue of abortion in europe? Do you see these far-right parties as threatening? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3879.02s)]
*  reproductive health [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3885.0s)]
*  Is this a voting issue? Um for the far-right as well as people on the progressive side of politics [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3886.8599999999997s)]
*  There is a huge support to abortion in the european society [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3892.7799999999997s)]
*  So often far-right parties actually lie that they are supporting abortion or they are quiet till they come into the power [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3896.62s)]
*  We all know georgia meloni and what she is doing now like last week [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3904.2999999999997s)]
*  She decided that she will basically allow anti-abortion activists to enter the clinics where abortions are happening [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3908.14s)]
*  In italy 63 percent of doctors already is not performing abortions. Now it will be even worse [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3915.5s)]
*  so basically the far-right is [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3922.94s)]
*  Attacking the bodies of women basically the far-right is using abortion as their momentum but not out loud [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3925.74s)]
*  And what we want to do with this campaign is to show that this is a political issue [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3932.8599999999997s)]
*  And basically to show that people don't want to vote for that kind of shit that is happening now in italy or in poland [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3938.2999999999997s)]
*  Or in malta and we hope that we will achieve this [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3944.9399999999996s)]
*  But what we are seeing is like by the amount of volunteers people who are joining the campaign [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3948.7s)]
*  That this is basically a common value in europe that protecting abortion rights is something that we stand for it [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3954.2999999999997s)]
*  And that people will be voting against politicians who are attacking this and do you think is this in the u.s? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3961.3399999999997s)]
*  I think you know the abortion issue [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3967.3399999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately because of what happened with the overturning of roe versus wade [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3969.8799999999997s)]
*  You saw more and more women and young people voting and mobilizing around this issue [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3974.8599999999997s)]
*  It seemed like in poland for instance women were pretty important to the election victory [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3980.2999999999997s)]
*  surprising electoral victory [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3985.58s)]
*  Of the opposition there [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3987.3399999999997s)]
*  Do you do you feel like this is an issue that might help swing? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3990.06s)]
*  elections more broadly in europe [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3994.14s)]
*  If people feel like their rights are on the ballot in the way that we've seen here in the u.s [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=3996.9399999999996s)]
*  Yes, like abortion was the main topic before polish elections [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4001.98s)]
*  Polish women's strike us who are two groups who are fighting for abortion and who are fighting to change the authoritarian government [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4006.8599999999997s)]
*  In poland and one of the first promises of the newly elected politicians was to legalize abortion [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4013.66s)]
*  These things still didn't happen. People are furious. They are still waiting that someone will die in polish hospitals [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4021.2599999999998s)]
*  So they're saying like now we need to take again things into our own hands [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4028.38s)]
*  Forced the politicians in national parliaments to change things but also on the european level and for example france [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4033.34s)]
*  Which is a totally different story. They just put abortion in the constitution again [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4041.42s)]
*  The feeling between the people is the same like we did it like it's something that we are super proud of on it [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4046.22s)]
*  But now let's force europe to do the same [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4052.3s)]
*  and people also [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4055.26s)]
*  Understand that their responsibilities also to watch out [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4057.16s)]
*  who [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4062.04s)]
*  We will elect and if I joke a little bit like we don't want to become us [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4063.08s)]
*  In europe in a sense of like what happens to you and how you lost your rights [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4067.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's you know, I mean you don't want to become us. Trust me if it involves donald trump or overturning rights [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4072.04s)]
*  Um, all right. I gotta ask you a couple more things [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4078.12s)]
*  um [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4080.8399999999997s)]
*  You you know, i've known you for years a few years now [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4081.7999999999997s)]
*  What people don't know is you're also like basically like the [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4085.7200000000003s)]
*  In addition to being an extraordinary person [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4089.88s)]
*  uh critical to some of the recent successes in slovenia [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4092.44s)]
*  My question for you is what can the world learn from slovenia when it comes to democracy? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4096.6s)]
*  Yeah, slovenia is a two million country. We have two famous people in slovenia [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4100.84s)]
*  One is melania trump and the other is luca donchich [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4105.0s)]
*  Well, that's good work, but I hope that people would know our country by defeating the [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4107.8s)]
*  Authoritarian authoritarian leader that we had the anaconda civil society led the fight [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4115.22s)]
*  We went on the street and we did uh referendums with a really positive content [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4120.76s)]
*  We said we don't want to be angry. Uh, we want to show people what is the vision for tomorrow and um, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4126.68s)]
*  We did like bracelets [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4133.4800000000005s)]
*  Friendship bracelets before taylor swift we were having concerts [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4135.959999999999s)]
*  We were having a lot of fun [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4139.959999999999s)]
*  But also being really clear about what is like our political demand which is like social state [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4141.639999999999s)]
*  free school system free health system [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4149.32s)]
*  And also like politicians who are not attacking you we managed to change the government [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4152.28s)]
*  um, and right now I have a feeling that we are in this period of like transition where you can still see [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4157.799999999999s)]
*  Authoritarians being super alive in the institutions [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4165.3s)]
*  but uh center being lost in a sense of like [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4168.780000000001s)]
*  Not having like its own agenda and knowing that they need to be here for the people [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4172.3s)]
*  And I always say that slovenia taught me that people are not stupid that they will vote for the leaders [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4177.5s)]
*  Who will actually deliver who will actually do stuff and I hope that slovenian governments? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4183.5s)]
*  Is becoming aware of this because elections are in two years and those guys keep coming back [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4189.02s)]
*  So I don't want to fight again in two years [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4194.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well as people can see you you you bring, uh, you brought a lot of joy and and enthusiasm and energy to these campaigns [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4198.06s)]

*  I think that we lose all the time with those stupid mistakes [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4245.36s)]
*  We try with campaigns that don't come together [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4248.34s)]
*  We have the super hard election year in front of us where I think we can mostly lose [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4251.46s)]
*  But like one thing that we have is to dance and fight and have fun [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnEv217LAag&t=4257.139999999999s)]
